Licence details: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\nIn the spirit of the brevity of social media's messages and reactions, people have got used to express feelings minimally and symbolically, as with hashtags on Twitter and Instagram. On Facebook, people tend to be more wordy, but posts normally receive more simple \u201clikes\u201d than longer comments. Since February 2016, Facebook users can express specific emotions in response to a post thanks to the newly introduced reaction feature (see Section SECREF2 ), so that now a post can be wordlessly marked with an expression of say \u201cjoy\" or \u201csurprise\" rather than a generic \u201clike\u201d.\nIt has been observed that this new feature helps Facebook to know much more about their users and exploit this information for targeted advertising BIBREF0 , but interest in people's opinions and how they feel isn't limited to commercial reasons, as it invests social monitoring, too, including health care and education BIBREF1 . However, emotions and opinions are not always expressed this explicitly, so that there is high interest in developing systems towards their automatic detection. Creating manually annotated datasets large enough to train supervised models is not only costly, but also\u2014especially in the case of opinions and emotions\u2014difficult, due to the intrinsic subjectivity of the task BIBREF2 , BIBREF3 . Therefore, research has focused on unsupervised methods enriched with information derived from lexica, which are manually created BIBREF3 , BIBREF4 . Since go2009twitter have shown that happy and sad emoticons can be successfully used as signals for sentiment labels, distant supervision, i.e. using some reasonably safe signals as proxies for automatically labelling training data BIBREF5 , has been used also for emotion recognition, for example exploiting both emoticons and Twitter hashtags BIBREF6 , but mainly towards creating emotion lexica. mohammad2015using use hashtags, experimenting also with highly fine-grained emotion sets (up to almost 600 emotion labels), to create the large Hashtag Emotion Lexicon. Emoticons are used as proxies also by hallsmarmulti, who use distributed vector representations to find which words are interchangeable with emoticons but also which emoticons are used in a similar context.\nWe take advantage of distant supervision by using Facebook reactions as proxies for emotion labels, which to the best of our knowledge hasn't been done yet, and we train a set of Support Vector Machine models for emotion recognition. Our models, differently from existing ones, exploit information which is acquired entirely automatically, and achieve competitive or even state-of-the-art results for some of the emotion labels on existing, standard evaluation datasets. For explanatory purposes, related work is discussed further and more in detail when we describe the benchmarks for evaluation (Section SECREF3 ) and when we compare our models to existing ones (Section SECREF5 ). We also explore and discuss how choosing different sets of Facebook pages as training data provides an intrinsic domain-adaptation method.\nFacebook reactions as labels\nFor years, on Facebook people could leave comments to posts, and also \u201clike\u201d them, by using a thumbs-up feature to explicitly express a generic, rather underspecified, approval. A \u201clike\u201d could thus mean \u201cI like what you said\", but also \u201cI like that you bring up such topic (though I find the content of the article you linked annoying)\".\nIn February 2016, after a short trial, Facebook made a more explicit reaction feature available world-wide. Rather than allowing for the underspecified \u201clike\u201d as the only wordless response to a post, a set of six more specific reactions was introduced, as shown in Figure FIGREF1 : Like, Love, Haha, Wow, Sad and Angry. We use such reactions as proxies for emotion labels associated to posts.\nWe collected Facebook posts and their corresponding reactions from public pages using the Facebook API, which we accessed via the Facebook-sdk python library. We chose different pages (and therefore domains and stances), aiming at a balanced and varied dataset, but we did so mainly based on intuition (see Section SECREF4 ) and with an eye to the nature of the datasets available for evaluation (see Section SECREF5 ). The choice of which pages to select posts from is far from trivial, and we believe this is actually an interesting aspect of our approach, as by using different Facebook pages one can intrinsically tackle the domain-adaptation problem (See Section SECREF6 for further discussion on this). The final collection of Facebook pages for the experiments described in this paper is as follows: FoxNews, CNN, ESPN, New York Times, Time magazine, Huffington Post Weird News, The Guardian, Cartoon Network, Cooking Light, Home Cooking Adventure, Justin Bieber, Nickelodeon, Spongebob, Disney.\nNote that thankful was only available during specific time spans related to certain events, as Mother's Day in May 2016.\nFor each page, we downloaded the latest 1000 posts, or the maximum available if there are fewer, from February 2016, retrieving the counts of reactions for each post. The output is a JSON file containing a list of dictionaries with a timestamp, the post and a reaction vector with frequency values, which indicate how many users used that reaction in response to the post (Figure FIGREF3 ). The resulting emotion vectors must then be turned into an emotion label.\nIn the context of this experiment, we made the simple decision of associating to each post the emotion with the highest count, ignoring like as it is the default and most generic reaction people tend to use. Therefore, for example, to the first post in Figure FIGREF3 , we would associate the label sad, as it has the highest score (284) among the meaningful emotions we consider, though it also has non-zero scores for other emotions. At this stage, we didn't perform any other entropy-based selection of posts, to be investigated in future work.\nEmotion datasets\nThree datasets annotated with emotions are commonly used for the development and evaluation of emotion detection systems, namely the Affective Text dataset, the Fairy Tales dataset, and the ISEAR dataset. In order to compare our performance to state-of-the-art results, we have used them as well. In this Section, in addition to a description of each dataset, we provide an overview of the emotions used, their distribution, and how we mapped them to those we obtained from Facebook posts in Section SECREF7 . A summary is provided in Table TABREF8 , which also shows, in the bottom row, what role each dataset has in our experiments: apart from the development portion of the Affective Text, which we used to develop our models (Section SECREF4 ), all three have been used as benchmarks for our evaluation.\nAffective Text dataset\nTask 14 at SemEval 2007 BIBREF7 was concerned with the classification of emotions and valence in news headlines. The headlines where collected from several news websites including Google news, The New York Times, BBC News and CNN. The used emotion labels were Anger, Disgust, Fear, Joy, Sadness, Surprise, in line with the six basic emotions of Ekman's standard model BIBREF8 . Valence was to be determined as positive or negative. Classification of emotion and valence were treated as separate tasks. Emotion labels were not considered as mututally exclusive, and each emotion was assigned a score from 0 to 100. Training/developing data amounted to 250 annotated headlines (Affective development), while systems were evaluated on another 1000 (Affective test). Evaluation was done using two different methods: a fine-grained evaluation using Pearson's r to measure the correlation between the system scores and the gold standard; and a coarse-grained method where each emotion score was converted to a binary label, and precision, recall, and f-score were computed to assess performance. As it is done in most works that use this dataset BIBREF3 , BIBREF4 , BIBREF9 , we also treat this as a classification problem (coarse-grained). This dataset has been extensively used for the evaluation of various unsupervised methods BIBREF2 , but also for testing different supervised learning techniques and feature portability BIBREF10 .\nFairy Tales dataset\nThis is a dataset collected by alm2008affect, where about 1,000 sentences from fairy tales (by B. Potter, H.C. Andersen and Grimm) were annotated with the same six emotions of the Affective Text dataset, though with different names: Angry, Disgusted, Fearful, Happy, Sad, and Surprised. In most works that use this dataset BIBREF3 , BIBREF4 , BIBREF9 , only sentences where all annotators agreed are used, and the labels angry and disgusted are merged. We adopt the same choices.\nISEAR\nThe ISEAR (International Survey on Emotion Antecedents and Reactions BIBREF11 , BIBREF12 ) is a dataset created in the context of a psychology project of the 1990s, by collecting questionnaires answered by people with different cultural backgrounds. The main aim of this project was to gather insights in cross-cultural aspects of emotional reactions. Student respondents, both psychologists and non-psychologists, were asked to report situations in which they had experienced all of seven major emotions (joy, fear, anger, sadness, disgust, shame and guilt). In each case, the questions covered the way they had appraised a given situation and how they reacted. The final dataset contains reports by approximately 3000 respondents from all over the world, for a total of 7665 sentences labelled with an emotion, making this the largest dataset out of the three we use.\nOverview of datasets and emotions\nWe summarise datasets and emotion distribution from two viewpoints. First, because there are different sets of emotions labels in the datasets and Facebook data, we need to provide a mapping and derive a subset of emotions that we are going to use for the experiments. This is shown in Table TABREF8 , where in the \u201cMapped\u201d column we report the final emotions we use in this paper: anger, joy, sadness, surprise. All labels in each dataset are mapped to these final emotions, which are therefore the labels we use for training and testing our models.\nSecond, the distribution of the emotions for each dataset is different, as can be seen in Figure FIGREF9 .\nIn Figure FIGREF9 we also provide the distribution of the emotions anger, joy, sadness, surprise per Facebook page, in terms of number of posts (recall that we assign to a post the label corresponding to the majority emotion associated to it, see Section SECREF2 ). We can observe that for example pages about news tend to have more sadness and anger posts, while pages about cooking and tv-shows have a high percentage of joy posts. We will use this information to find the best set of pages for a given target domain (see Section SECREF5 ).\nModel\nThere are two main decisions to be taken in developing our model: (i) which Facebook pages to select as training data, and (ii) which features to use to train the model, which we discuss below. Specifically, we first set on a subset of pages and then experiment with features. Further exploration of the interaction between choice of pages and choice of features is left to future work, and partly discussed in Section SECREF6 . For development, we use a small portion of the Affective data set described in Section SECREF4 , that is the portion that had been released as development set for SemEval's 2007 Task 14 BIBREF7 , which contains 250 annotated sentences (Affective development, Section SECREF4 ). All results reported in this section are on this dataset. The test set of Task 14 as well as the other two datasets described in Section SECREF3 will be used to evaluate the final models (Section SECREF4 ).\nSelecting Facebook pages\nAlthough page selection is a crucial ingredient of this approach, which we believe calls for further and deeper, dedicated investigation, for the experiments described here we took a rather simple approach. First, we selected the pages that would provide training data based on intuition and availability, then chose different combinations according to results of a basic model run on development data, and eventually tested feature combinations, still on the development set.\nFor the sake of simplicity and transparency, we first trained an SVM with a simple bag-of-words model and default parameters as per the Scikit-learn implementation BIBREF13 on different combinations of pages. Based on results of the attempted combinations as well as on the distribution of emotions in the development dataset (Figure FIGREF9 ), we selected a best model (B-M), namely the combined set of Time, The Guardian and Disney, which yields the highest results on development data. Time and The Guardian perform well on most emotions but Disney helps to boost the performance for the Joy class.\nFeatures\nIn selecting appropriate features, we mainly relied on previous work and intuition. We experimented with different combinations, and all tests were still done on Affective development, using the pages for the best model (B-M) described above as training data. Results are in Table TABREF20 . Future work will further explore the simultaneous selection of features and page combinations.\nWe use a set of basic text-based features to capture the emotion class. These include a tf-idf bag-of-words feature, word (2-3) and character (2-5) ngrams, and features related to the presence of negation words, and to the usage of punctuation.\nThis feature is used in all unsupervised models as a source of information, and we mainly include it to assess its contribution, but eventually do not use it in our final model.\nWe used the NRC10 Lexicon because it performed best in the experiments by BIBREF10 , which is built around the emotions anger, anticipation, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, and surprise, and the valence values positive and negative. For each word in the lexicon, a boolean value indicating presence or absence is associated to each emotion. For a whole sentence, a global score per emotion can be obtained by summing the vectors for all content words of that sentence included in the lexicon, and used as feature.\nAs additional feature, we also included Word Embeddings, namely distributed representations of words in a vector space, which have been exceptionally successful in boosting performance in a plethora of NLP tasks. We use three different embeddings:\nGoogle embeddings: pre-trained embeddings trained on Google News and obtained with the skip-gram architecture described in BIBREF14 . This model contains 300-dimensional vectors for 3 million words and phrases.\nFacebook embeddings: embeddings that we trained on our scraped Facebook pages for a total of 20,000 sentences. Using the gensim library BIBREF15 , we trained the embeddings with the following parameters: window size of 5, learning rate of 0.01 and dimensionality of 100. We filtered out words with frequency lower than 2 occurrences.\nRetrofitted embeddings: Retrofitting BIBREF16 has been shown as a simple but efficient way of informing trained embeddings with additional information derived from some lexical resource, rather than including it directly at the training stage, as it's done for example to create sense-aware BIBREF17 or sentiment-aware BIBREF18 embeddings. In this work, we retrofit general embeddings to include information about emotions, so that emotion-similar words can get closer in space. Both the Google as well as our Facebook embeddings were retrofitted with lexical information obtained from the NRC10 Lexicon mentioned above, which provides emotion-similarity for each token. Note that differently from the previous two types of embeddings, the retrofitted ones do rely on handcrafted information in the form of a lexical resource.\nResults on development set\nWe report precision, recall, and f-score on the development set. The average f-score is reported as micro-average, to better account for the skewed distribution of the classes as well as in accordance to what is usually reported for this task BIBREF19 .\nFrom Table TABREF20 we draw three main observations. First, a simple tf-idf bag-of-word mode works already very well, to the point that the other textual and lexicon-based features don't seem to contribute to the overall f-score (0.368), although there is a rather substantial variation of scores per class. Second, Google embeddings perform a lot better than Facebook embeddings, and this is likely due to the size of the corpus used for training. Retrofitting doesn't seem to help at all for the Google embeddings, but it does boost the Facebook embeddings, leading to think that with little data, more accurate task-related information is helping, but corpus size matters most. Third, in combination with embeddings, all features work better than just using tf-idf, but removing the Lexicon feature, which is the only one based on hand-crafted resources, yields even better results. Then our best model (B-M) on development data relies entirely on automatically obtained information, both in terms of training data as well as features.\nResults\nIn Table TABREF26 we report the results of our model on the three datasets standardly used for the evaluation of emotion classification, which we have described in Section SECREF3 .\nOur B-M model relies on subsets of Facebook pages for training, which were chosen according to their performance on the development set as well as on the observation of emotions distribution on different pages and in the different datasets, as described in Section SECREF4 . The feature set we use is our best on the development set, namely all the features plus Google-based embeddings, but excluding the lexicon. This makes our approach completely independent of any manual annotation or handcrafted resource. Our model's performance is compared to the following systems, for which results are reported in the referred literature. Please note that no other existing model was re-implemented, and results are those reported in the respective papers.\nDiscussion, conclusions and future work\nWe have explored the potential of using Facebook reactions in a distant supervised setting to perform emotion classification. The evaluation on standard benchmarks shows that models trained as such, especially when enhanced with continuous vector representations, can achieve competitive results without relying on any handcrafted resource. An interesting aspect of our approach is the view to domain adaptation via the selection of Facebook pages to be used as training data.\nWe believe that this approach has a lot of potential, and we see the following directions for improvement. Feature-wise, we want to train emotion-aware embeddings, in the vein of work by tang:14, and iacobacci2015sensembed. Retrofitting FB-embeddings trained on a larger corpus might also be successful, but would rely on an external lexicon.\nThe largest room for yielding not only better results but also interesting insights on extensions of this approach lies in the choice of training instances, both in terms of Facebook pages to get posts from, as well as in which posts to select from the given pages. For the latter, one could for example only select posts that have a certain length, ignore posts that are only quotes or captions to images, or expand posts by including content from linked html pages, which might provide larger and better contexts BIBREF23 . Additionally, and most importantly, one could use an entropy-based measure to select only posts that have a strong emotion rather than just considering the majority emotion as training label. For the former, namely the choice of Facebook pages, which we believe deserves the most investigation, one could explore several avenues, especially in relation to stance-based issues BIBREF24 . In our dataset, for example, a post about Chile beating Colombia in a football match during the Copa America had very contradictory reactions, depending on which side readers would cheer for. Similarly, the very same political event, for example, would get very different reactions from readers if it was posted on Fox News or The Late Night Show, as the target audience is likely to feel very differently about the same issue. This also brings up theoretical issues related more generally to the definition of the emotion detection task, as it's strongly dependent on personal traits of the audience. Also, in this work, pages initially selected on availability and intuition were further grouped into sets to make training data according to performance on development data, and label distribution. Another criterion to be exploited would be vocabulary overlap between the pages and the datasets.\nLastly, we could develop single models for each emotion, treating the problem as a multi-label task. This would even better reflect the ambiguity and subjectivity intrinsic to assigning emotions to text, where content could be at same time joyful or sad, depending on the reader.\nAcknowledgements\nIn addition to the anonymous reviewers, we want to thank Lucia Passaro and Barbara Plank for insightful discussions, and for providing comments on draft versions of this paper.\n\n Answer the question based on the above article as concisely as you can, using a single phrase or sentence if possible.

The final collection of Facebook pages for the experiments described in this paper is as follows: FoxNews, CNN, ESPN, New York Times, Time magazine, Huffington Post Weird News, The Guardian, Cartoon Network, Cooking Light, Home Cooking Adventure, Justin Bieber, Nickelodeon, Spongebob, Disney.\nNote that thankful was only available during specific time spans related to certain events, as Mother's Day in May 2016.\nFor each page, we downloaded the latest 1000 posts, or the maximum available if there are fewer, from February 2016, retrieving the counts of reactions for each post.

In order to compare our performance to state-of-the-art results, we have used them as well. In this Section, in addition to a description of each dataset, we provide an overview of the emotions used, their distribution, and how we mapped them to those we obtained from Facebook posts in Section SECREF7 .

The headlines where collected from several news websites including Google news, The New York Times, BBC News and CNN. The used emotion labels were Anger, Disgust, Fear, Joy, Sadness, Surprise, in line with the six basic emotions of Ekman's standard model BIBREF8 .

This dataset has been extensively used for the evaluation of various unsupervised methods BIBREF2 , but also for testing different supervised learning techniques and feature portability BIBREF10 .\nFairy Tales dataset\nThis is a dataset collected by alm2008affect, where about 1,000 sentences from fairy tales (by B. Potter, H.C. Andersen and Grimm) were annotated with the same six emotions of the Affective Text dataset, though with different names: Angry, Disgusted, Fearful, Happy, Sad, and Surprised. In most works that use this dataset BIBREF3 , BIBREF4 , BIBREF9 , only sentences where all annotators agreed are used, and the labels angry and disgusted are merged. We adopt the same choices.\nISEAR\nThe ISEAR (International Survey on Emotion Antecedents and Reactions BIBREF11 , BIBREF12 ) is a dataset created in the context of a psychology project of the 1990s, by collecting questionnaires answered by people with different cultural backgrounds. The main aim of this project was to gather insights in cross-cultural aspects of emotional reactions. Student respondents, both psychologists and non-psychologists, were asked to report situations in which they had experienced all of seven major emotions (joy, fear, anger, sadness, disgust, shame and guilt). In each case, the questions covered the way they had appraised a given situation and how they reacted. The final dataset contains reports by approximately 3000 respondents from all over the world, for a total of 7665 sentences labelled with an emotion, making this the largest dataset out of the three we use.\nOverview of datasets and emotions\nWe summarise datasets and emotion distribution from two viewpoints. First, because there are different sets of emotions labels in the datasets and Facebook data, we need to provide a mapping and derive a subset of emotions that we are going to use for the experiments. This is shown in Table TABREF8 , where in the \u201cMapped\u201d column we report the final emotions we use in this paper: anger, joy, sadness, surprise. All labels in each dataset are mapped to these final emotions, which are therefore the labels we use for training and testing our models.\nSecond, the distribution of the emotions for each dataset is different, as can be seen in Figure FIGREF9 .\nIn Figure FIGREF9 we also provide the distribution of the emotions anger, joy, sadness, surprise per Facebook page, in terms of number of posts (recall that we assign to a post the label corresponding to the majority emotion associated to it, see Section SECREF2 ). We can observe that for example pages about news tend to have more sadness and anger posts, while pages about cooking and tv-shows have a high percentage of joy posts. We will use this information to find the best set of pages for a given target domain (see Section SECREF5 ).\nModel\nThere are two main decisions to be taken in developing our model: (i) which Facebook pages to select as training data, and (ii) which features to use to train the model, which we discuss below. Specifically, we first set on a subset of pages and then experiment with features. Further exploration of the interaction between choice of pages and choice of features is left to future work, and partly discussed in Section SECREF6 . For development, we use a small portion of the Affective data set described in Section SECREF4 , that is the portion that had been released as development set for SemEval's 2007 Task 14 BIBREF7 , which contains 250 annotated sentences (Affective development, Section SECREF4 ). All results reported in this section are on this dataset. The test set of Task 14 as well as the other two datasets described in Section SECREF3 will be used to evaluate the final models (Section SECREF4 ).\nSelecting Facebook pages\nAlthough page selection is a crucial ingredient of this approach, which we believe calls for further and deeper, dedicated investigation, for the experiments described here we took a rather simple approach.

Time and The Guardian perform well on most emotions but Disney helps to boost the performance for the Joy class.\nFeatures\nIn selecting appropriate features, we mainly relied on previous work and intuition. We experimented with different combinations, and all tests were still done on Affective development, using the pages for the best model (B-M) described above as training data. Results are in Table TABREF20 . Future work will further explore the simultaneous selection of features and page combinations.\nWe use a set of basic text-based features to capture the emotion class.

Using the gensim library BIBREF15 , we trained the embeddings with the following parameters: window size of 5, learning rate of 0.01 and dimensionality of 100. We filtered out words with frequency lower than 2 occurrences.\nRetrofitted embeddings: Retrofitting BIBREF16 has been shown as a simple but efficient way of informing trained embeddings with additional information derived from some lexical resource, rather than including it directly at the training stage, as it's done for example to create sense-aware BIBREF17 or sentiment-aware BIBREF18 embeddings. In this work, we retrofit general embeddings to include information about emotions, so that emotion-similar words can get closer in space. Both the Google as well as our Facebook embeddings were retrofitted with lexical information obtained from the NRC10 Lexicon mentioned above, which provides emotion-similarity for each token. Note that differently from the previous two types of embeddings, the retrofitted ones do rely on handcrafted information in the form of a lexical resource.\nResults on development set\nWe report precision, recall, and f-score on the development set. The average f-score is reported as micro-average, to better account for the skewed distribution of the classes as well as in accordance to what is usually reported for this task BIBREF19 .\nFrom Table TABREF20 we draw three main observations. First, a simple tf-idf bag-of-word mode works already very well, to the point that the other textual and lexicon-based features don't seem to contribute to the overall f-score (0.368), although there is a rather substantial variation of scores per class. Second, Google embeddings perform a lot better than Facebook embeddings, and this is likely due to the size of the corpus used for training. Retrofitting doesn't seem to help at all for the Google embeddings, but it does boost the Facebook embeddings, leading to think that with little data, more accurate task-related information is helping, but corpus size matters most. Third, in combination with embeddings, all features work better than just using tf-idf, but removing the Lexicon feature, which is the only one based on hand-crafted resources, yields even better results. Then our best model (B-M) on development data relies entirely on automatically obtained information, both in terms of training data as well as features.\nResults\nIn Table TABREF26 we report the results of our model on the three datasets standardly used for the evaluation of emotion classification, which we have described in Section SECREF3 .\nOur B-M model relies on subsets of Facebook pages for training, which were chosen according to their performance on the development set as well as on the observation of emotions distribution on different pages and in the different datasets, as described in Section SECREF4 . The feature set we use is our best on the development set, namely all the features plus Google-based embeddings, but excluding the lexicon. This makes our approach completely independent of any manual annotation or handcrafted resource. Our model's performance is compared to the following systems, for which results are reported in the referred literature. Please note that no other existing model was re-implemented, and results are those reported in the respective papers.\nDiscussion, conclusions and future work\nWe have explored the potential of using Facebook reactions in a distant supervised setting to perform emotion classification. The evaluation on standard benchmarks shows that models trained as such, especially when enhanced with continuous vector representations, can achieve competitive results without relying on any handcrafted resource. An interesting aspect of our approach is the view to domain adaptation via the selection of Facebook pages to be used as training data.\nWe believe that this approach has a lot of potential, and we see the following directions for improvement. Feature-wise, we want to train emotion-aware embeddings, in the vein of work by tang:14, and iacobacci2015sensembed. Retrofitting FB-embeddings trained on a larger corpus might also be successful, but would rely on an external lexicon.\nThe largest room for yielding not only better results but also interesting insights on extensions of this approach lies in the choice of training instances, both in terms of Facebook pages to get posts from, as well as in which posts to select from the given pages. For the latter, one could for example only select posts that have a certain length, ignore posts that are only quotes or captions to images, or expand posts by including content from linked html pages, which might provide larger and better contexts BIBREF23 . Additionally, and most importantly, one could use an entropy-based measure to select only posts that have a strong emotion rather than just considering the majority emotion as training label. For the former, namely the choice of Facebook pages, which we believe deserves the most investigation, one could explore several avenues, especially in relation to stance-based issues BIBREF24 . In our dataset, for example, a post about Chile beating Colombia in a football match during the Copa America had very contradictory reactions, depending on which side readers would cheer for. Similarly, the very same political event, for example, would get very different reactions from readers if it was posted on Fox News or The Late Night Show, as the target audience is likely to feel very differently about the same issue. This also brings up theoretical issues related more generally to the definition of the emotion detection task, as it's strongly dependent on personal traits of the audience. Also, in this work, pages initially selected on availability and intuition were further grouped into sets to make training data according to performance on development data, and label distribution. Another criterion to be exploited would be vocabulary overlap between the pages and the datasets.\nLastly, we could develop single models for each emotion, treating the problem as a multi-label task. This would even better reflect the ambiguity and subjectivity intrinsic to assigning emotions to text, where content could be at same time joyful or sad, depending on the reader.\nAcknowledgements\nIn addition to the anonymous reviewers, we want to thank Lucia Passaro and Barbara Plank for insightful discussions, and for providing comments on draft versions of this paper.", "answers": ["FoxNews, CNN, ESPN, New York Times, Time magazine, Huffington Post Weird News, The Guardian, Cartoon Network, Cooking Light, Home Cooking Adventure, Justin Bieber, Nickelodeon, Spongebob, Disney", "FoxNews, CNN, ESPN, New York Times, Time magazine, Huffington Post Weird News, The Guardian, Cartoon Network, Cooking Light, Home Cooking Adventure, Justin Bieber, Nickelodeon, Spongebob, Disney."], "length": 3411, "dataset": "qasper_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "b26174d8ec97e8d01421548d3a640e8382db6235eb506661", "pred": " FoxNews, CNN, ESPN, New York Times, Time magazine, Huffington Post Weird News, The Guardian, Cartoon Network, Cooking Light, Home Cooking Adventure, Justin Bieber, Nickelodeon, Spongebob, Disney."}

Such massive scaling through online classrooms, however, disrupt co-located, synchronous two-way communication between the students and the instructor.\nMOOC platforms provide discussion forums for students to talk to their classmates about the lectures, homeworks, quizzes and provide a venue to socialise. Instructors (defined here as the course instructors, their teaching assistants and the MOOC platform's technical staff) monitor the discussion forum to post (reply to their message) in discussion threads among students. We refer to this posting as intervention, following prior work BIBREF0 . However, due to large student enrolment, the student\u2013instructor ratio in MOOCs is very high Therefore, instructors are not able to monitor and participate in all student discussions. To address this problem, a number of works have proposed systems e.g., BIBREF0 , BIBREF1 to aid instructors to selectively intervene on student discussions where they are needed the most.\nIn this paper, we improve the state-of-the-art for instructor intervention in MOOC forums. We propose the first neural models for this prediction problem. We show that modelling the thread structure and the sequence of posts explicitly improves performance. Instructors in different MOOCs from different subject areas intervene differently. For example, on a Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) MOOC, instructors may often intervene early as possible to resolve misunderstanding of the subject material and prevent confusion. However, in a Humanities MOOC, instructors allow for the students to explore open-ended discussions and debate among themselves. Such instructors may prefer to intervene later in the discussion to encourage further discussion or resolve conflicts among students. We therefore propose attention models to infer the latent context, i.e., the series of posts that trigger an intervention. Earlier studies on MOOC forum intervention either model the entire context or require the context size to be specified explicitly.\nProblem Statement\nA thread INLINEFORM0 consists of a series of posts INLINEFORM1 through INLINEFORM2 where INLINEFORM3 is an instructor's post when INLINEFORM4 is intervened, if applicable. INLINEFORM5 is considered intervened if an instructor had posted at least once. The problem of predicting instructor intervention is cast as a binary classification problem. Intervened threads are predicted as 1 given while non-intervened threads are predicted as 0 given posts INLINEFORM6 through INLINEFORM7 .\nThe primary problem leads to a secondary problem of inferring the appropriate amount of context to intervene. We define a context INLINEFORM0 of a post INLINEFORM1 as a series of linear contiguous posts INLINEFORM2 through INLINEFORM3 where INLINEFORM4 . The problem of inferring context is to identify context INLINEFORM5 from a set of candidate contexts INLINEFORM6 .\nModelling Context in Forums\nContext has been used and modelled in various ways for different problems in discussion forums. In a work on a closely related problem of forum thread retrieval BIBREF2 models context using inter-post discourse e.g., Question-Answer. BIBREF3 models the structural dependencies and relationships between forum posts using a conditional random field in their problem to infer the reply structure. Unlike BIBREF2 , BIBREF3 can be used to model any structural dependency and is, therefore, more general. In this paper, we seek to infer general dependencies between a reply and its previous context whereas BIBREF3 inference is limited to pairs of posts. More recently BIBREF4 proposed a context based model which factorises attention over threads of different lengths. Differently, we do not model length but the context before a post. However, our attention models cater to threads of all lengths.\nBIBREF5 proposed graph structured LSTM to model the explicit reply structure in Reddit forums. Our work does not assume access to such a reply structure because 1) Coursera forums do not provide one and 2) forum participants often err by posting their reply to a different post than that they intended. At the other end of the spectrum are document classification models that do not assume structure in the document layout but try to infer inherent structure in the natural language, viz, words, sentences, paragraphs and documents. Hierarchical attention BIBREF6 is a well know recent work that classifies documents using a multi-level LSTMs with attention mechanism to select important units at each hierarchical level. Differently, we propose a hierarchical model that encodes layout hierarchy between a post and a thread but also infers reply structure using a attention mechanism since the layout does not reliably encode it.\nInstructor Intervention in MOOC forums\nThe problem of predicting instructor intervention in MOOCs was proposed by BIBREF0 . Later BIBREF7 evaluated baseline models by BIBREF0 over a larger corpus and found the results to vary widely across MOOCs. Since then subsequent works have used similar diverse evaluations on the same prediction problem BIBREF1 , BIBREF8 . BIBREF1 proposed models with discourse features to enable better prediction over unseen MOOCs. BIBREF8 recently showed interventions on Coursera forums to be biased by the position at which a thread appears to an instructor viewing the forum interface and proposed methods for debiased prediction.\nWhile all works since BIBREF0 address key limitations in this line of research, they have not investigated the role of structure and sequence in the threaded discussion in predicting instructor interventions. BIBREF0 proposed probabilistic graphical models to model structure and sequence. They inferred vocabulary dependent latent post categories to model the thread sequence and infer states that triggered intervention. Their model, however, requires a hyperparameter for the number of latent states. It is likely that their empirically reported setting will not generalise due to their weak evaluation BIBREF7 . In this paper, we propose models to infer the context that triggers instructor intervention that does not require context lengths to be set apriori. All our proposed models generalise over modelling assumptions made by BIBREF0 .\nFor the purpose of comparison against a state-of-the-art and competing baselines we choose BIBREF7 since BIBREF0 's system and data are not available for replication.\nData and Preprocessing\nWe evaluate our proposed models over a corpus of 12 MOOC iterations (offerings) on Coursera.org In partnership with Coursera and in line with its Terms of Service, we obtained the data for use in our academic research. Following prior work BIBREF7 we evaluate over a diverse dataset to represent MOOCs of varying sizes, instructor styles, instructor team sizes and number of threads intervened. We only include threads from sub-forums on Lecture, Homework, Quiz and Exam. We also normalise and label sub-forums with other non-standard names (e.g., Assignments instead of Homework) into of the four said sub-forums. Threads on general discussion, meet and greet and other custom sub-forums for social chitchat are omitted as our focus is to aid instructors on intervening on discussion on the subject matter. We also exclude announcement threads and other threads started by instructors since they are not interventions. We preprocess each thread by replacing URLs, equations and other mathematical formulae and references to timestamps in lecture videos by tokens INLINEFORM0 URL INLINEFORM1 , INLINEFORM2 MATH INLINEFORM3 , INLINEFORM4 TIMEREF INLINEFORM5 respectively. We also truncate intervened threads to only include posts before the first instructor post since the instructor's and subsequent posts will bias the prediction due to the instructor's post.\nModel\nThe key innovation of our work is to decompose the intervention prediction problem into a two-stage model that first explicitly tries to discover the proper context to which a potential intervention could be replying to, and then, predict the intervention status. This model implicitly assesses the importance (or urgency) of the existing thread's context to decide whether an intervention is necessary. For example in Figure SECREF1 , prior to the instructor's intervention, the ultimate post (Post #6) by Student 2 already acknowledged the OP's gratitude for his answer. In this regard, the instructor may have decided to use this point to summarize the entire thread to consolidate all the pertinent positions. Here, we might assume that the instructor's reply takes the entire thread (Posts #1\u20136) as the context for her reply.\nThis subproblem of inferring the context scope is where our innovation centers on. To be clear, in order to make the prediction that a instruction intervention is now necessary on a thread, the instructor's reply is not yet available \u2014 the model predicts whether a reply is necessary \u2014 so in the example, only Posts #1\u20136 are available in the problem setting. To infer the context, we have to decide which subsequence of posts are the most plausible motivation for an intervention.\nRecent work in deep neural modeling has used an attention mechanism as a focusing query to highlight specific items within the input history that significantly influence the current decision point. Our work employs this mechanism \u2013 but with a twist: due to the fact that the actual instructor intervention is not (yet) available at the decision timing, we cannot use any actual intervention to decide the context. To employ attention, we must then employ a surrogate text as the query to train our prediction model. Our model variants model assess the suitability of such surrogate texts for the attention mechanism basis.\nCongruent with the representation of the input forums, in all our proposed models, we encode the discussion thread hierarchically. We first build representations for each post by passing pre-trained word vector representations from GloVe BIBREF9 for each word through an LSTM BIBREF10 , INLINEFORM0 . We use the last layer output of the LSTM as a representation of the post. We refer this as the post vector INLINEFORM1 .\nThen each post INLINEFORM0 is passed through another LSTM, INLINEFORM1 , whose last layer output forms the encoding of the entire thread. Hidden unit outputs of INLINEFORM2 represent the contexts INLINEFORM3 ; that is, snapshots of the threads after each post, as shown in Figure FIGREF1 .\nThe INLINEFORM0 and INLINEFORM1 together constitute the hierarchical LSTM (hLSTM) model. This general hLSTM model serves as the basis for our model exploration in the rest of this section.\nContextual Attention Models\nWhen they intervene, instructors either pay attention to a specific post or a series of posts, which trigger their reply. However, instructors rarely explicitly indicate to which post(s) their intervention is in relation to. This is the case in our corpus, party due to Coursera's user interface which only allows for single level comments (see Figure FIGREF2 ). Based solely on the binary, thread-level intervention signal, our secondary objective seeks to infer the appropriate context \u2013 represented by a sequence of posts \u2013 as the basis for the intervention.\nWe only consider linear contiguous series of posts starting with the thread's original post to constitute to a context; e.g., INLINEFORM0 . This is a reasonable as MOOC forum posts always reply to the original post or to a subsequent post, which in turn replies to the original post. This is in contrast to forums such as Reddit that have a tree or graph-like structure that require forum structure to be modelled explicitly, such as in BIBREF5 .\nWe propose three neural attention BIBREF11 variants based on how an instructor might attend and reply to a context in a thread: the ultimate, penultimate and any post attention models. We review each of these in turn.\nUltimate Post Attention (UPA) Model. In this model we attend to the context represented by hidden state of the INLINEFORM0 . We use the post prior to the instructor's reply as a query over the contexts INLINEFORM1 to compute attention weights INLINEFORM2 , which are then used to compute the attended context representation INLINEFORM3 (recall again that the intervention text itself is not available for this purpose). This attention formulation makes an equivalence between the final INLINEFORM4 post and the prospective intervention, using Post INLINEFORM5 as the query for finding the appropriate context INLINEFORM6 , inclusive of itself INLINEFORM7 . Said in another way, UPA uses the most recent content in the thread as the attentional query for context.\nFor example, if post INLINEFORM0 is the instructor's reply, post INLINEFORM1 will query over the contexts INLINEFORM2 and INLINEFORM3 . The model schematic is shown in Figure FIGREF12 .\nThe attended context representations are computed as: DISPLAYFORM0\nThe INLINEFORM0 representation is then passed through a fully connected softmax layer to yield the binary prediction.\nPenultimate Post Attention (PPA) Model. While the UPA model uses the most recent text and makes the ultimate post itself available as potential context, our the ultimate post may be better modeled as having any of its prior posts as potential context. Penultimate Post Attention (PPA) variant does this. The schematic and the equations for the PPA model are obtained by summing over contexts INLINEFORM0 in Equation EQREF10 and Figure FIGREF12 . While we could properly model such a context inference decision with any post INLINEFORM1 and prospective contexts INLINEFORM2 (where INLINEFORM3 is a random post), it makes sense to use the penultimate post, as we can make the most information available to the model for the context inference.\nThe attended context representations are computed as: DISPLAYFORM0\nAny Post Attention (APA) Model. APA further relaxes both UPA and PPA, allowing APA to generalize and hypothesize that the prospective instructor intervention is based on the context that any previous post INLINEFORM0 replied to. In this model, each post INLINEFORM1 is set as a query to attend to its previous context INLINEFORM2 . For example, INLINEFORM3 will attend to INLINEFORM4 . Different from standard attention mechanisms, APA attention weights INLINEFORM5 are obtained by normalising interaction matrix over the different queries.\nIn APA, the attention context INLINEFORM0 is computed via: DISPLAYFORM0\nEvaluation\nThe baseline and the models are evaluated on a corpus of 12 MOOC discussion forums. We train on 80% of the training data and report evaluation results on the held-out 20% of test data. We report INLINEFORM0 scores on the positive class (interventions), in line with prior work. We also argue that recall of the positive class is more important than precision, since it is costlier for instructors to miss intervening on a thread than spending irrelevant time intervening on a less critical threads due to false positives.\nModel hyperpameter settings. All proposed and baseline neural models are trained using Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001. We used cross-entropy as loss function. Importantly we updated the model parameters during training after each instance as in vanilla stochastic gradient descent; this setting was practical since data on most courses had only a few hundred instances enabling convergence within a reasonable training time of a few hours (see Table TABREF15 , column 2). Models were trained for a single epoch as most of our courses with a few hundred thread converged after a single epoch. We used 300-dimensional GloVe vectors and permitted the embeddings to be updated during the model's end-to-end training. The hidden dimension size of both INLINEFORM0 and INLINEFORM1 are set to 128 for all the models.\nBaselines. We compare our models against a neural baseline models, hierarchical LSTM (hLSTM), with the attention ablated but with access to the complete context, and a strong, open-sourced feature-rich baseline BIBREF7 . We choose BIBREF7 over other prior works such as BIBREF0 since we do not have access to the dataset or the system used in their papers for replication. BIBREF7 is a logistic regression classifier with features inclusive of bag-of-words representation of the unigrams and thread length, normalised counts of agreements to previous posts, counts of non-lexical reference items such as URLs, and the Coursera forum type in which a thread appeared. We also report aggregated results from a hLSTM model with access only to the last post as context for comparison. Table TABREF17 compares the performance of these baselines against our proposed methods.\nResults\nTable TABREF15 shows performance of all our proposed models and the neural baseline over our 12 MOOC dataset. Our models of UPA, PPA individually better the baseline by 5 and 2% on INLINEFORM0 and 3 and 6% on recall respectively. UPA performs the best in terms of INLINEFORM1 on average while PPA performs the best in terms of recall on average. At the individual course level, however, the results are mixed. UPA performs the best on INLINEFORM2 on 5 out of 12 courses, PPA on 3 out 12 courses, APA 1 out of 12 courses and the baseline hLSTM on 1. PPA performs the best on recall on 7 out of the 12 courses. We also note that course level performance differences correlate with the course size and intervention ratio (hereafter, i.ratio), which is the ratio of intervened to non-intervened threads. UPA performs better than PPA and APA on low intervention courses (i.ratio INLINEFORM3 0.25) mainly because PPA and APA's performance drops steeply when i.ratio drops (see col.2 parenthesis and INLINEFORM4 of PPA and APA). While all the proposed models beat the baseline on every course except casebased-2. On medicalneuro-2 and compilers-4 which have the lowest i.ratio among the 12 courses none of the neural models better the reported baseline BIBREF7 (course level not scores not shown in this paper). The effect is pronounced in compilers-4 course where none of the neural models were able to predict any intervened threads. This is due to the inherent weakness of standard neural models, which are unable to learn features well enough when faced with sparse data.\nThe best performance of UPA indicates that the reply context of the instructor's post INLINEFORM0 correlates strongly with that of the previous post INLINEFORM1 . This is not surprising since normal conversations are typically structured that way.\nDiscussion\nIn order to further understand the models' ability to infer the context and its effect on intervention prediction, we further investigate the following research questions.\nRQ1. Does context inference help intervention prediction?\nIn order to understand if context inference is useful to intervention prediction, we ablate the attention components and experiment with the vanilla hierarchical LSTM model. Row 3 of Table TABREF17 shows the macro averaged result from this experiment. The UPA and PPA attention models better the vanilla hLSTM by 5% and 2% on average in INLINEFORM0 respectively. Recall that the vanilla hLSTM already has access to a context consisting of all posts (from INLINEFORM1 through INLINEFORM2 ). In contrast, the UPA and PPA models selectively infers a context for INLINEFORM3 and INLINEFORM4 posts, respectively, and use it to predict intervention. The improved performance of our attention models that actively select their optimal context, over a model with the complete thread as context, hLSTM, shows that the context inference improves intervention prediction over using the default full context.\nRQ2. How well do the models perform across threads of different lengths? To understand the models' prediction performance across threads of different lengths, we bin threads by length and study the models' recall. We choose three courses, ml-5, rprog-3 and calc-1, from our corpus of 12 with the highest number of positive instances ( INLINEFORM0 100 threads). We limit our analysis to these since binning renders courses with fewer positive instances sparse. Figure FIGREF18 shows performance across thread lengths from 1 through 7 posts and INLINEFORM1 posts. Clearly, the UPA model performs much better on shorter threads than on longer threads while PPA and APA works better on longer threads. Although, UPA is the best performing model in terms of overall INLINEFORM2 its performance drops steeply on threads of length INLINEFORM3 . UPA's overall best performance is because most of the interventions in the corpus happen after one post. To highlight the performance of APA we show an example from smac-1 in Figure FIGREF22 with nine posts which was predicted correctly as intervened by APA but not by other models. Threads shows students confused over a missing figure in a homework. The instructor finally shows up, though late, to resolve the confusion.\nRQ3. Do models trained with different context lengths perform better than when trained on a single context length?\nWe find that context length has a regularising effect on the model's performance at test time. This is not surprising since models trained with threads of single context length will not generalise to infer different context lengths. Row 4 of Table TABREF17 shows a steep performance drop in training by classifier with all threads truncated to a context of just one post, INLINEFORM0 , the post immediately preceding the intervened post. We also conducted an experiment with a multi-objective loss function with an additive cross-entropy term where each term computes loss from a model with context limited to a length of 3. We chose 3 since intervened threads in all the courses had a median length between 3 and 4. We achieved an INLINEFORM1 of 0.45 with a precision of 0.47 and recall of 0.43. This achieves a performance comparable to that of the BIBREF7 with context length set to only to 3. This approach of using infinitely many loss terms for each context length from 1 through the maximum thread length in a course is naive and not practical. We only use this model to show the importance of training the model with loss from threads of different lengths to prevent models overfitting to threads of specific context lengths.\nConclusion\nWe predict instructor intervention on student discussions by first inferring the optimal size of the context needed to decide on the intervention decision for the intervened post. We first show that a structured representation of the complete thread as the context is better than a bag-of-words, feature-rich representation. We then propose attention-based models to infer and select a context \u2013 defined as a contiguous subsequence of student posts \u2013 to improve over a model that always takes the complete thread as a context to prediction intervention. Our Any Post Attention (APA) model enables instructors to tune the model to predict intervention early or late. We posit our APA model will enable MOOC instructors employing varying pedagogical styles to use the model equally well. We introspect the attention models' performance across threads of varying lengths and show that APA predicts intervention on longer threads, which possesses more candidate contexts, better.\nWe note that the recall of the predictive models for longer threads (that is, threads of length greater 2) can still be improved. Models perform differently between shorter and longer length. An ensemble model or a multi-objective loss function is thus planned in our future work to better prediction on such longer threads.\n\n Answer the question based on the above article as concisely as you can, using a single phrase or sentence if possible.

In this paper, we propose models to infer the context that triggers instructor intervention that does not require context lengths to be set apriori. All our proposed models generalise over modelling assumptions made by BIBREF0 .\nFor the purpose of comparison against a state-of-the-art and competing baselines we choose BIBREF7 since BIBREF0 's system and data are not available for replication.\nData and Preprocessing\nWe evaluate our proposed models over a corpus of 12 MOOC iterations (offerings) on Coursera.org In partnership with Coursera and in line with its Terms of Service, we obtained the data for use in our academic research. Following prior work BIBREF7 we evaluate over a diverse dataset to represent MOOCs of varying sizes, instructor styles, instructor team sizes and number of threads intervened. We only include threads from sub-forums on Lecture, Homework, Quiz and Exam. We also normalise and label sub-forums with other non-standard names (e.g., Assignments instead of Homework) into of the four said sub-forums. Threads on general discussion, meet and greet and other custom sub-forums for social chitchat are omitted as our focus is to aid instructors on intervening on discussion on the subject matter. We also exclude announcement threads and other threads started by instructors since they are not interventions. We preprocess each thread by replacing URLs, equations and other mathematical formulae and references to timestamps in lecture videos by tokens INLINEFORM0 URL INLINEFORM1 , INLINEFORM2 MATH INLINEFORM3 , INLINEFORM4 TIMEREF INLINEFORM5 respectively. We also truncate intervened threads to only include posts before the first instructor post since the instructor's and subsequent posts will bias the prediction due to the instructor's post.\nModel\nThe key innovation of our work is to decompose the intervention prediction problem into a two-stage model that first explicitly tries to discover the proper context to which a potential intervention could be replying to, and then, predict the intervention status. This model implicitly assesses the importance (or urgency) of the existing thread's context to decide whether an intervention is necessary. For example in Figure SECREF1 , prior to the instructor's intervention, the ultimate post (Post #6) by Student 2 already acknowledged the OP's gratitude for his answer. In this regard, the instructor may have decided to use this point to summarize the entire thread to consolidate all the pertinent positions. Here, we might assume that the instructor's reply takes the entire thread (Posts #1\u20136) as the context for her reply.\nThis subproblem of inferring the context scope is where our innovation centers on. To be clear, in order to make the prediction that a instruction intervention is now necessary on a thread, the instructor's reply is not yet available \u2014 the model predicts whether a reply is necessary \u2014 so in the example, only Posts #1\u20136 are available in the problem setting. To infer the context, we have to decide which subsequence of posts are the most plausible motivation for an intervention.\nRecent work in deep neural modeling has used an attention mechanism as a focusing query to highlight specific items within the input history that significantly influence the current decision point. Our work employs this mechanism \u2013 but with a twist: due to the fact that the actual instructor intervention is not (yet) available at the decision timing, we cannot use any actual intervention to decide the context. To employ attention, we must then employ a surrogate text as the query to train our prediction model. Our model variants model assess the suitability of such surrogate texts for the attention mechanism basis.\nCongruent with the representation of the input forums, in all our proposed models, we encode the discussion thread hierarchically. We first build representations for each post by passing pre-trained word vector representations from GloVe BIBREF9 for each word through an LSTM BIBREF10 , INLINEFORM0 . We use the last layer output of the LSTM as a representation of the post. We refer this as the post vector INLINEFORM1 .\nThen each post INLINEFORM0 is passed through another LSTM, INLINEFORM1 , whose last layer output forms the encoding of the entire thread. Hidden unit outputs of INLINEFORM2 represent the contexts INLINEFORM3 ; that is, snapshots of the threads after each post, as shown in Figure FIGREF1 .\nThe INLINEFORM0 and INLINEFORM1 together constitute the hierarchical LSTM (hLSTM) model. This general hLSTM model serves as the basis for our model exploration in the rest of this section.\nContextual Attention Models\nWhen they intervene, instructors either pay attention to a specific post or a series of posts, which trigger their reply. However, instructors rarely explicitly indicate to which post(s) their intervention is in relation to. This is the case in our corpus, party due to Coursera's user interface which only allows for single level comments (see Figure FIGREF2 ). Based solely on the binary, thread-level intervention signal, our secondary objective seeks to infer the appropriate context \u2013 represented by a sequence of posts \u2013 as the basis for the intervention.\nWe only consider linear contiguous series of posts starting with the thread's original post to constitute to a context; e.g., INLINEFORM0 . This is a reasonable as MOOC forum posts always reply to the original post or to a subsequent post, which in turn replies to the original post. This is in contrast to forums such as Reddit that have a tree or graph-like structure that require forum structure to be modelled explicitly, such as in BIBREF5 .\nWe propose three neural attention BIBREF11 variants based on how an instructor might attend and reply to a context in a thread: the ultimate, penultimate and any post attention models. We review each of these in turn.\nUltimate Post Attention (UPA) Model. In this model we attend to the context represented by hidden state of the INLINEFORM0 . We use the post prior to the instructor's reply as a query over the contexts INLINEFORM1 to compute attention weights INLINEFORM2 , which are then used to compute the attended context representation INLINEFORM3 (recall again that the intervention text itself is not available for this purpose). This attention formulation makes an equivalence between the final INLINEFORM4 post and the prospective intervention, using Post INLINEFORM5 as the query for finding the appropriate context INLINEFORM6 , inclusive of itself INLINEFORM7 . Said in another way, UPA uses the most recent content in the thread as the attentional query for context.\nFor example, if post INLINEFORM0 is the instructor's reply, post INLINEFORM1 will query over the contexts INLINEFORM2 and INLINEFORM3 . The model schematic is shown in Figure FIGREF12 .\nThe attended context representations are computed as: DISPLAYFORM0\nThe INLINEFORM0 representation is then passed through a fully connected softmax layer to yield the binary prediction.\nPenultimate Post Attention (PPA) Model. While the UPA model uses the most recent text and makes the ultimate post itself available as potential context, our the ultimate post may be better modeled as having any of its prior posts as potential context. Penultimate Post Attention (PPA) variant does this. The schematic and the equations for the PPA model are obtained by summing over contexts INLINEFORM0 in Equation EQREF10 and Figure FIGREF12 . While we could properly model such a context inference decision with any post INLINEFORM1 and prospective contexts INLINEFORM2 (where INLINEFORM3 is a random post), it makes sense to use the penultimate post, as we can make the most information available to the model for the context inference.\nThe attended context representations are computed as: DISPLAYFORM0\nAny Post Attention (APA) Model. APA further relaxes both UPA and PPA, allowing APA to generalize and hypothesize that the prospective instructor intervention is based on the context that any previous post INLINEFORM0 replied to. In this model, each post INLINEFORM1 is set as a query to attend to its previous context INLINEFORM2 . For example, INLINEFORM3 will attend to INLINEFORM4 . Different from standard attention mechanisms, APA attention weights INLINEFORM5 are obtained by normalising interaction matrix over the different queries.\nIn APA, the attention context INLINEFORM0 is computed via: DISPLAYFORM0\nEvaluation\nThe baseline and the models are evaluated on a corpus of 12 MOOC discussion forums. We train on 80% of the training data and report evaluation results on the held-out 20% of test data. We report INLINEFORM0 scores on the positive class (interventions), in line with prior work. We also argue that recall of the positive class is more important than precision, since it is costlier for instructors to miss intervening on a thread than spending irrelevant time intervening on a less critical threads due to false positives.\nModel hyperpameter settings. All proposed and baseline neural models are trained using Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001. We used cross-entropy as loss function. Importantly we updated the model parameters during training after each instance as in vanilla stochastic gradient descent; this setting was practical since data on most courses had only a few hundred instances enabling convergence within a reasonable training time of a few hours (see Table TABREF15 , column 2). Models were trained for a single epoch as most of our courses with a few hundred thread converged after a single epoch. We used 300-dimensional GloVe vectors and permitted the embeddings to be updated during the model's end-to-end training. The hidden dimension size of both INLINEFORM0 and INLINEFORM1 are set to 128 for all the models.\nBaselines. We compare our models against a neural baseline models, hierarchical LSTM (hLSTM), with the attention ablated but with access to the complete context, and a strong, open-sourced feature-rich baseline BIBREF7 . We choose BIBREF7 over other prior works such as BIBREF0 since we do not have access to the dataset or the system used in their papers for replication. BIBREF7 is a logistic regression classifier with features inclusive of bag-of-words representation of the unigrams and thread length, normalised counts of agreements to previous posts, counts of non-lexical reference items such as URLs, and the Coursera forum type in which a thread appeared. We also report aggregated results from a hLSTM model with access only to the last post as context for comparison. Table TABREF17 compares the performance of these baselines against our proposed methods.\nResults\nTable TABREF15 shows performance of all our proposed models and the neural baseline over our 12 MOOC dataset. Our models of UPA, PPA individually better the baseline by 5 and 2% on INLINEFORM0 and 3 and 6% on recall respectively. UPA performs the best in terms of INLINEFORM1 on average while PPA performs the best in terms of recall on average. At the individual course level, however, the results are mixed. UPA performs the best on INLINEFORM2 on 5 out of 12 courses, PPA on 3 out 12 courses, APA 1 out of 12 courses and the baseline hLSTM on 1. PPA performs the best on recall on 7 out of the 12 courses. We also note that course level performance differences correlate with the course size and intervention ratio (hereafter, i.ratio), which is the ratio of intervened to non-intervened threads. UPA performs better than PPA and APA on low intervention courses (i.ratio INLINEFORM3 0.25) mainly because PPA and APA's performance drops steeply when i.ratio drops (see col.2 parenthesis and INLINEFORM4 of PPA and APA). While all the proposed models beat the baseline on every course except casebased-2. On medicalneuro-2 and compilers-4 which have the lowest i.ratio among the 12 courses none of the neural models better the reported baseline BIBREF7 (course level not scores not shown in this paper). The effect is pronounced in compilers-4 course where none of the neural models were able to predict any intervened threads. This is due to the inherent weakness of standard neural models, which are unable to learn features well enough when faced with sparse data.\nThe best performance of UPA indicates that the reply context of the instructor's post INLINEFORM0 correlates strongly with that of the previous post INLINEFORM1 . This is not surprising since normal conversations are typically structured that way.\nDiscussion\nIn order to further understand the models' ability to infer the context and its effect on intervention prediction, we further investigate the following research questions.\nRQ1. Does context inference help intervention prediction?\nIn order to understand if context inference is useful to intervention prediction, we ablate the attention components and experiment with the vanilla hierarchical LSTM model. Row 3 of Table TABREF17 shows the macro averaged result from this experiment. The UPA and PPA attention models better the vanilla hLSTM by 5% and 2% on average in INLINEFORM0 respectively. Recall that the vanilla hLSTM already has access to a context consisting of all posts (from INLINEFORM1 through INLINEFORM2 ). In contrast, the UPA and PPA models selectively infers a context for INLINEFORM3 and INLINEFORM4 posts, respectively, and use it to predict intervention. The improved performance of our attention models that actively select their optimal context, over a model with the complete thread as context, hLSTM, shows that the context inference improves intervention prediction over using the default full context.\nRQ2. How well do the models perform across threads of different lengths? To understand the models' prediction performance across threads of different lengths, we bin threads by length and study the models' recall. We choose three courses, ml-5, rprog-3 and calc-1, from our corpus of 12 with the highest number of positive instances ( INLINEFORM0 100 threads). We limit our analysis to these since binning renders courses with fewer positive instances sparse. Figure FIGREF18 shows performance across thread lengths from 1 through 7 posts and INLINEFORM1 posts. Clearly, the UPA model performs much better on shorter threads than on longer threads while PPA and APA works better on longer threads. Although, UPA is the best performing model in terms of overall INLINEFORM2 its performance drops steeply on threads of length INLINEFORM3 . UPA's overall best performance is because most of the interventions in the corpus happen after one post. To highlight the performance of APA we show an example from smac-1 in Figure FIGREF22 with nine posts which was predicted correctly as intervened by APA but not by other models. Threads shows students confused over a missing figure in a homework. The instructor finally shows up, though late, to resolve the confusion.\nRQ3. Do models trained with different context lengths perform better than when trained on a single context length?\nWe find that context length has a regularising effect on the model's performance at test time. This is not surprising since models trained with threads of single context length will not generalise to infer different context lengths. Row 4 of Table TABREF17 shows a steep performance drop in training by classifier with all threads truncated to a context of just one post, INLINEFORM0 , the post immediately preceding the intervened post. We also conducted an experiment with a multi-objective loss function with an additive cross-entropy term where each term computes loss from a model with context limited to a length of 3. We chose 3 since intervened threads in all the courses had a median length between 3 and 4. We achieved an INLINEFORM1 of 0.45 with a precision of 0.47 and recall of 0.43. This achieves a performance comparable to that of the BIBREF7 with context length set to only to 3. This approach of using infinitely many loss terms for each context length from 1 through the maximum thread length in a course is naive and not practical. We only use this model to show the importance of training the model with loss from threads of different lengths to prevent models overfitting to threads of specific context lengths.\nConclusion\nWe predict instructor intervention on student discussions by first inferring the optimal size of the context needed to decide on the intervention decision for the intervened post. We first show that a structured representation of the complete thread as the context is better than a bag-of-words, feature-rich representation. We then propose attention-based models to infer and select a context \u2013 defined as a contiguous subsequence of student posts \u2013 to improve over a model that always takes the complete thread as a context to prediction intervention. Our Any Post Attention (APA) model enables instructors to tune the model to predict intervention early or late. We posit our APA model will enable MOOC instructors employing varying pedagogical styles to use the model equally well. We introspect the attention models' performance across threads of varying lengths and show that APA predicts intervention on longer threads, which possesses more candidate contexts, better.\nWe note that the recall of the predictive models for longer threads (that is, threads of length greater 2) can still be improved. Models perform differently between shorter and longer length. An ensemble model or a multi-objective loss function is thus planned in our future work to better prediction on such longer threads.", "answers": ["the series of posts that trigger an intervention"], "length": 3732, "dataset": "qasper_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "8e5e6c35689e17e9f50df76ada506a4c05be9ed081c883d4", "pred": " Linear contiguous posts."}

Do not provide any explanation.\n\nArticle: Introduction\nSarcasm is an intensive, indirect and complex construct that is often intended to express contempt or ridicule . Sarcasm, in speech, is multi-modal, involving tone, body-language and gestures along with linguistic artifacts used in speech. Sarcasm in text, on the other hand, is more restrictive when it comes to such non-linguistic modalities. This makes recognizing textual sarcasm more challenging for both humans and machines.\nSarcasm detection plays an indispensable role in applications like online review summarizers, dialog systems, recommendation systems and sentiment analyzers. This makes automatic detection of sarcasm an important problem. However, it has been quite difficult to solve such a problem with traditional NLP tools and techniques. This is apparent from the results reported by the survey from DBLP:journals/corr/JoshiBC16. The following discussion brings more insights into this.\nConsider a scenario where an online reviewer gives a negative opinion about a movie through sarcasm: \u201cThis is the kind of movie you see because the theater has air conditioning\u201d. It is difficult for an automatic sentiment analyzer to assign a rating to the movie and, in the absence of any other information, such a system may not be able to comprehend that prioritizing the air-conditioning facilities of the theater over the movie experience indicates a negative sentiment towards the movie. This gives an intuition to why, for sarcasm detection, it is necessary to go beyond textual analysis.\nWe aim to address this problem by exploiting the psycholinguistic side of sarcasm detection, using cognitive features extracted with the help of eye-tracking. A motivation to consider cognitive features comes from analyzing human eye-movement trajectories that supports the conjecture: Reading sarcastic texts induces distinctive eye movement patterns, compared to literal texts. The cognitive features, derived from human eye movement patterns observed during reading, include two primary feature types:\nThe cognitive features, along with textual features used in best available sarcasm detectors, are used to train binary classifiers against given sarcasm labels. Our experiments show significant improvement in classification accuracy over the state of the art, by performing such augmentation.\nRelated Work\nSarcasm, in general, has been the focus of research for quite some time. In one of the pioneering works jorgensen1984test explained how sarcasm arises when a figurative meaning is used opposite to the literal meaning of the utterance. In the word of clark1984pretense, sarcasm processing involves canceling the indirectly negated message and replacing it with the implicated one. giora1995irony, on the other hand, define sarcasm as a mode of indirect negation that requires processing of both negated and implicated messages. ivanko2003context define sarcasm as a six tuple entity consisting of a speaker, a listener, Context, Utterance, Literal Proposition and Intended Proposition and study the cognitive aspects of sarcasm processing.\nComputational linguists have previously addressed this problem using rule based and statistical techniques, that make use of : (a) Unigrams and Pragmatic features BIBREF0 , BIBREF1 , BIBREF2 , BIBREF3 (b) Stylistic patterns BIBREF4 and patterns related to situational disparity BIBREF5 and (c) Hastag interpretations BIBREF6 , BIBREF7 .\nMost of the previously done work on sarcasm detection uses distant supervision based techniques (ex: leveraging hashtags) and stylistic/pragmatic features (emoticons, laughter expressions such as \u201clol\u201d etc). But, detecting sarcasm in linguistically well-formed structures, in absence of explicit cues or information (like emoticons), proves to be hard using such linguistic/stylistic features alone.\nWith the advent of sophisticated eye-trackers and electro/magneto-encephalographic (EEG/MEG) devices, it has been possible to delve deep into the cognitive underpinnings of sarcasm understanding. Filik2014, using a series of eye-tracking and EEG experiments try to show that for unfamiliar ironies, the literal interpretation would be computed first. They also show that a mismatch with context would lead to a re-interpretation of the statement, as being ironic. Camblin2007103 show that in multi-sentence passages, discourse congruence has robust effects on eye movements. This also implies that disrupted processing occurs for discourse incongruent words, even though they are perfectly congruous at the sentence level. In our previous work BIBREF8 , we augment cognitive features, derived from eye-movement patterns of readers, with textual features to detect whether a human reader has realized the presence of sarcasm in text or not.\nThe recent advancements in the literature discussed above, motivate us to explore gaze-based cognition for sarcasm detection. As far as we know, our work is the first of its kind.\nEye-tracking Database for Sarcasm Analysis\nSarcasm often emanates from incongruity BIBREF9 , which enforces the brain to reanalyze it BIBREF10 . This, in turn, affects the way eyes move through the text. Hence, distinctive eye-movement patterns may be observed in the case of successful processing of sarcasm in text in contrast to literal texts. This hypothesis forms the crux of our method for sarcasm detection and we validate this using our previously released freely available sarcasm dataset BIBREF8 enriched with gaze information.\nDocument Description\nThe database consists of 1,000 short texts, each having 10-40 words. Out of these, 350 are sarcastic and are collected as follows: (a) 103 sentences are from two popular sarcastic quote websites, (b) 76 sarcastic short movie reviews are manually extracted from the Amazon Movie Corpus BIBREF11 by two linguists. (c) 171 tweets are downloaded using the hashtag #sarcasm from Twitter. The 650 non-sarcastic texts are either downloaded from Twitter or extracted from the Amazon Movie Review corpus. The sentences do not contain words/phrases that are highly topic or culture specific. The tweets were normalized to make them linguistically well formed to avoid difficulty in interpreting social media lingo. Every sentence in our dataset carries positive or negative opinion about specific \u201caspects\u201d. For example, the sentence \u201cThe movie is extremely well cast\u201d has positive sentiment about the aspect \u201ccast\u201d.\nThe annotators were seven graduate students with science and engineering background, and possess good English proficiency. They were given a set of instructions beforehand and are advised to seek clarifications before they proceed. The instructions mention the nature of the task, annotation input method, and necessity of head movement minimization during the experiment.\nTask Description\nThe task assigned to annotators was to read sentences one at a time and label them with with binary labels indicating the polarity (i.e., positive/negative). Note that, the participants were not instructed to annotate whether a sentence is sarcastic or not., to rule out the Priming Effect (i.e., if sarcasm is expected beforehand, processing incongruity becomes relatively easier BIBREF12 ). The setup ensures its \u201cecological validity\u201d in two ways: (1) Readers are not given any clue that they have to treat sarcasm with special attention. This is done by setting the task to polarity annotation (instead of sarcasm detection). (2) Sarcastic sentences are mixed with non sarcastic text, which does not give prior knowledge about whether the forthcoming text will be sarcastic or not.\nThe eye-tracking experiment is conducted by following the standard norms in eye-movement research BIBREF13 . At a time, one sentence is displayed to the reader along with the \u201caspect\u201d with respect to which the annotation has to be provided. While reading, an SR-Research Eyelink-1000 eye-tracker (monocular remote mode, sampling rate 500Hz) records several eye-movement parameters like fixations (a long stay of gaze) and saccade (quick jumping of gaze between two positions of rest) and pupil size.\nThe accuracy of polarity annotation varies between 72%-91% for sarcastic texts and 75%-91% for non-sarcastic text, showing the inherent difficulty of sentiment annotation, when sarcasm is present in the text under consideration. Annotation errors may be attributed to: (a) lack of patience/attention while reading, (b) issues related to text comprehension, and (c) confusion/indecisiveness caused due to lack of context.\nFor our analysis, we do not discard the incorrect annotations present in the database. Since our system eventually aims to involve online readers for sarcasm detection, it will be hard to segregate readers who misinterpret the text. We make a rational assumption that, for a particular text, most of the readers, from a fairly large population, will be able to identify sarcasm. Under this assumption, the eye-movement parameters, averaged across all readers in our setting, may not be significantly distorted by a few readers who would have failed to identify sarcasm. This assumption is applicable for both regular and multi-instance based classifiers explained in section SECREF6 .\nAnalysis of Eye-movement Data\nWe observe distinct behavior during sarcasm reading, by analyzing the \u201cfixation duration on the text\u201d (also referred to as \u201cdwell time\u201d in the literature) and \u201cscanpaths\u201d of the readers.\nVariation in the Average Fixation Duration per Word\nSince sarcasm in text can be expected to induce cognitive load, it is reasonable to believe that it would require more processing time BIBREF14 . Hence, fixation duration normalized over total word count should usually be higher for a sarcastic text than for a non-sarcastic one. We observe this for all participants in our dataset, with the average fixation duration per word for sarcastic texts being at least 1.5 times more than that of non-sarcastic texts. To test the statistical significance, we conduct a two-tailed t-test (assuming unequal variance) to compare the average fixation duration per word for sarcastic and non-sarcastic texts. The hypothesized mean difference is set to 0 and the error tolerance limit ( INLINEFORM0 ) is set to 0.05. The t-test analysis, presented in Table TABREF11 , shows that for all participants, a statistically significant difference exists between the average fixation duration per word for sarcasm (higher average fixation duration) and non-sarcasm (lower average fixation duration). This affirms that the presence of sarcasm affects the duration of fixation on words.\nIt is important to note that longer fixations may also be caused by other linguistic subtleties (such as difficult words, ambiguity and syntactically complex structures) causing delay in comprehension, or occulomotor control problems forcing readers to spend time adjusting eye-muscles. So, an elevated average fixation duration per word may not sufficiently indicate the presence of sarcasm. But we would also like to share that, for our dataset, when we considered readability (Flesch readability ease-score BIBREF15 ), number of words in a sentence and average character per word along with the sarcasm label as the predictors of average fixation duration following a linear mixed effect model BIBREF16 , sarcasm label turned out to be the most significant predictor with a maximum slope. This indicates that average fixation duration per word has a strong connection with the text being sarcastic, at least in our dataset.\nWe now analyze scanpaths to gain more insights into the sarcasm comprehension process.\nAnalysis of Scanpaths\nScanpaths are line-graphs that contain fixations as nodes and saccades as edges; the radii of the nodes represent the fixation duration. A scanpath corresponds to a participant's eye-movement pattern while reading a particular sentence. Figure FIGREF14 presents scanpaths of three participants for the sarcastic sentence S1 and the non-sarcastic sentence S2. The x-axis of the graph represents the sequence of words a reader reads, and the y-axis represents a temporal sequence in milliseconds.\nConsider a sarcastic text containing incongruous phrases A and B. Our qualitative scanpath-analysis reveals that scanpaths with respect to sarcasm processing have two typical characteristics. Often, a long regression - a saccade that goes to a previously visited segment - is observed when a reader starts reading B after skimming through A. In a few cases, the fixation duration on A and B are significantly higher than the average fixation duration per word. In sentence S1, we see long and multiple regressions from the two incongruous phrases \u201cmisconception\u201d and \u201ccherish\u201d, and a few instances where phrases \u201calways cherish\u201d and \u201coriginal misconception\u201d are fixated longer than usual. Such eye-movement behaviors are not seen for S2.\nThough sarcasm induces distinctive scanpaths like the ones depicted in Figure FIGREF14 in the observed examples, presence of such patterns is not sufficient to guarantee sarcasm; such patterns may also possibly arise from literal texts. We believe that a combination of linguistic features, readability of text and features derived from scanpaths would help discriminative machine learning models learn sarcasm better.\nFeatures for Sarcasm Detection\nWe describe the features used for sarcasm detection in Table . The features enlisted under lexical,implicit incongruity and explicit incongruity are borrowed from various literature (predominantly from joshi2015harnessing). These features are essential to separate sarcasm from other forms semantic incongruity in text (for example ambiguity arising from semantic ambiguity or from metaphors). Two additional textual features viz. readability and word count of the text are also taken under consideration. These features are used to reduce the effect of text hardness and text length on the eye-movement patterns.\nSimple Gaze Based Features\nReaders' eye-movement behavior, characterized by fixations, forward saccades, skips and regressions, can be directly quantified by simple statistical aggregation (i.e., either computing features for individual participants and then averaging or performing a multi-instance based learning as explained in section SECREF6 ). Since these eye-movement attributes relate to the cognitive process in reading BIBREF17 , we consider these as features in our model. Some of these features have been reported by sarcasmunderstandability for modeling sarcasm understandability of readers. However, as far as we know, these features are being introduced in NLP tasks like textual sarcasm detection for the first time. The values of these features are believed to increase with the increase in the degree of surprisal caused by incongruity in text (except skip count, which will decrease).\nComplex Gaze Based Features\nFor these features, we rely on a graph structure, namely \u201csaliency graphs\", derived from eye-gaze information and word sequences in the text.\nFor each reader and each sentence, we construct a \u201csaliency graph\u201d, representing the reader's attention characteristics. A saliency graph for a sentence INLINEFORM0 for a reader INLINEFORM1 , represented as INLINEFORM2 , is a graph with vertices ( INLINEFORM3 ) and edges ( INLINEFORM4 ) where each vertex INLINEFORM5 corresponds to a word in INLINEFORM6 (may not be unique) and there exists an edge INLINEFORM7 between vertices INLINEFORM8 and INLINEFORM9 if R performs at least one saccade between the words corresponding to INLINEFORM10 and INLINEFORM11 .\nFigure FIGREF15 shows an example of a saliency graph.A saliency graph may be weighted, but not necessarily connected, for a given text (as there may be words in the given text with no fixation on them). The \u201ccomplex\u201d gaze features derived from saliency graphs are also motivated by the theory of incongruity. For instance, Edge Density of a saliency graph increases with the number of distinct saccades, which could arise from the complexity caused by presence of sarcasm. Similarly, the highest weighted degree of a graph is expected to be higher, if the node corresponds to a phrase, incongruous to some other phrase in the text.\nThe Sarcasm Classifier\nWe interpret sarcasm detection as a binary classification problem. The training data constitutes 994 examples created using our eye-movement database for sarcasm detection. To check the effectiveness of our feature set, we observe the performance of multiple classification techniques on our dataset through a stratified 10-fold cross validation. We also compare the classification accuracy of our system and the best available systems proposed by riloff2013sarcasm and joshi2015harnessing on our dataset. Using Weka BIBREF18 and LibSVM BIBREF19 APIs, we implement the following classifiers:\nResults\nTable TABREF17 shows the classification results considering various feature combinations for different classifiers and other systems. These are:\nUnigram (with principal components of unigram feature vectors),\nSarcasm (the feature-set reported by joshi2015harnessing subsuming unigram features and features from other reported systems)\nGaze (the simple and complex cognitive features we introduce, along with readability and word count features), and\nGaze+Sarcasm (the complete set of features).\nFor all regular classifiers, the gaze features are averaged across participants and augmented with linguistic and sarcasm related features. For the MILR classifier, the gaze features derived from each participant are augmented with linguistic features and thus, a multi instance \u201cbag\u201d of features is formed for each sentence in the training data. This multi-instance dataset is given to an MILR classifier, which follows the standard multi instance assumption to derive class-labels for each bag.\nFor all the classifiers, our feature combination outperforms the baselines (considering only unigram features) as well as BIBREF3 , with the MILR classifier getting an F-score improvement of 3.7% and Kappa difference of 0.08. We also achieve an improvement of 2% over the baseline, using SVM classifier, when we employ our feature set. We also observe that the gaze features alone, also capture the differences between sarcasm and non-sarcasm classes with a high-precision but a low recall.\nTo see if the improvement obtained is statistically significant over the state-of-the art system with textual sarcasm features alone, we perform McNemar test. The output of the SVM classifier using only linguistic features used for sarcasm detection by joshi2015harnessing and the output of the MILR classifier with the complete set of features are compared, setting threshold INLINEFORM0 . There was a significant difference in the classifier's accuracy with p(two-tailed) = 0.02 with an odds-ratio of 1.43, showing that the classification accuracy improvement is unlikely to be observed by chance in 95% confidence interval.\nConsidering Reading Time as a Cognitive Feature along with Sarcasm Features\nOne may argue that, considering simple measures of reading effort like \u201creading time\u201d as cognitive feature instead of the expensive eye-tracking features for sarcasm detection may be a cost-effective solution. To examine this, we repeated our experiments with \u201creading time\u201d considered as the only cognitive feature, augmented with the textual features. The F-scores of all the classifiers turn out to be close to that of the classifiers considering sarcasm feature alone and the difference in the improvement is not statistically significant ( INLINEFORM0 ). One the other hand, F-scores with gaze features are superior to the F-scores when reading time is considered as a cognitive feature.\nHow Effective are the Cognitive Features\nWe examine the effectiveness of cognitive features on the classification accuracy by varying the input training data size. To examine this, we create a stratified (keeping the class ratio constant) random train-test split of 80%:20%. We train our classifier with 100%, 90%, 80% and 70% of the training data with our whole feature set, and the feature combination from joshi2015harnessing. The goodness of our system is demonstrated by improvements in F-score and Kappa statistics, shown in Figure FIGREF22 .\nWe further analyze the importance of features by ranking the features based on (a) Chi squared test, and (b) Information Gain test, using Weka's attribute selection module. Figure FIGREF23 shows the top 20 ranked features produced by both the tests. For both the cases, we observe 16 out of top 20 features to be gaze features. Further, in each of the cases, Average Fixation Duration per Word and Largest Regression Position are seen to be the two most significant features.\nExample Cases\nTable TABREF21 shows a few example cases from the experiment with stratified 80%-20% train-test split.\nExample sentence 1 is sarcastic, and requires extra-linguistic knowledge (about poor living conditions at Manchester). Hence, the sarcasm detector relying only on textual features is unable to detect the underlying incongruity. However, our system predicts the label successfully, possibly helped by the gaze features.\nSimilarly, for sentence 2, the false sense of presence of incongruity (due to phrases like \u201cHelped me\u201d and \u201cCan't stop\u201d) affects the system with only linguistic features. Our system, though, performs well in this case also.\nSentence 3 presents a false-negative case where it was hard for even humans to get the sarcasm. This is why our gaze features (and subsequently the complete set of features) account for erroneous prediction.\nIn sentence 4, gaze features alone false-indicate presence of incongruity, whereas the system predicts correctly when gaze and linguistic features are taken together.\nFrom these examples, it can be inferred that, only gaze features would not have sufficed to rule out the possibility of detecting other forms of incongruity that do not result in sarcasm.\nError Analysis\nErrors committed by our system arise from multiple factors, starting from limitations of the eye-tracker hardware to errors committed by linguistic tools and resources. Also, aggregating various eye-tracking parameters to extract the cognitive features may have caused information loss in the regular classification setting.\nConclusion\nIn the current work, we created a novel framework to detect sarcasm, that derives insights from human cognition, that manifests over eye movement patterns. We hypothesized that distinctive eye-movement patterns, associated with reading sarcastic text, enables improved detection of sarcasm. We augmented traditional linguistic features with cognitive features obtained from readers' eye-movement data in the form of simple gaze-based features and complex features derived from a graph structure. This extended feature-set improved the success rate of the sarcasm detector by 3.7%, over the best available system. Using cognitive features in an NLP Processing system like ours is the first proposal of its kind.\nOur general approach may be useful in other NLP sub-areas like sentiment and emotion analysis, text summarization and question answering, where considering textual clues alone does not prove to be sufficient. We propose to augment this work in future by exploring deeper graph and gaze features. We also propose to develop models for the purpose of learning complex gaze feature representation, that accounts for the power of individual eye movement patterns along with the aggregated patterns of eye movements.\nAcknowledgments\nWe thank the members of CFILT Lab, especially Jaya Jha and Meghna Singh, and the students of IIT Bombay for their help and support.\n\n Answer the question based on the above article as concisely as you can, using a single phrase or sentence if possible.

Sarcasm, in speech, is multi-modal, involving tone, body-language and gestures along with linguistic artifacts used in speech. Sarcasm in text, on the other hand, is more restrictive when it comes to such non-linguistic modalities. This makes recognizing textual sarcasm more challenging for both humans and machines.\nSarcasm detection plays an indispensable role in applications like online review summarizers, dialog systems, recommendation systems and sentiment analyzers. This makes automatic detection of sarcasm an important problem. However, it has been quite difficult to solve such a problem with traditional NLP tools and techniques. This is apparent from the results reported by the survey from DBLP:journals/corr/JoshiBC16. The following discussion brings more insights into this.\nConsider a scenario where an online reviewer gives a negative opinion about a movie through sarcasm: \u201cThis is the kind of movie you see because the theater has air conditioning\u201d. It is difficult for an automatic sentiment analyzer to assign a rating to the movie and, in the absence of any other information, such a system may not be able to comprehend that prioritizing the air-conditioning facilities of the theater over the movie experience indicates a negative sentiment towards the movie. This gives an intuition to why, for sarcasm detection, it is necessary to go beyond textual analysis.\nWe aim to address this problem by exploiting the psycholinguistic side of sarcasm detection, using cognitive features extracted with the help of eye-tracking. A motivation to consider cognitive features comes from analyzing human eye-movement trajectories that supports the conjecture: Reading sarcastic texts induces distinctive eye movement patterns, compared to literal texts. The cognitive features, derived from human eye movement patterns observed during reading, include two primary feature types:\nThe cognitive features, along with textual features used in best available sarcasm detectors, are used to train binary classifiers against given sarcasm labels. Our experiments show significant improvement in classification accuracy over the state of the art, by performing such augmentation.\nRelated Work\nSarcasm, in general, has been the focus of research for quite some time. In one of the pioneering works jorgensen1984test explained how sarcasm arises when a figurative meaning is used opposite to the literal meaning of the utterance. In the word of clark1984pretense, sarcasm processing involves canceling the indirectly negated message and replacing it with the implicated one. giora1995irony, on the other hand, define sarcasm as a mode of indirect negation that requires processing of both negated and implicated messages. ivanko2003context define sarcasm as a six tuple entity consisting of a speaker, a listener, Context, Utterance, Literal Proposition and Intended Proposition and study the cognitive aspects of sarcasm processing.\nComputational linguists have previously addressed this problem using rule based and statistical techniques, that make use of : (a) Unigrams and Pragmatic features BIBREF0 , BIBREF1 , BIBREF2 , BIBREF3 (b) Stylistic patterns BIBREF4 and patterns related to situational disparity BIBREF5 and (c) Hastag interpretations BIBREF6 , BIBREF7 .\nMost of the previously done work on sarcasm detection uses distant supervision based techniques (ex: leveraging hashtags) and stylistic/pragmatic features (emoticons, laughter expressions such as \u201clol\u201d etc). But, detecting sarcasm in linguistically well-formed structures, in absence of explicit cues or information (like emoticons), proves to be hard using such linguistic/stylistic features alone.\nWith the advent of sophisticated eye-trackers and electro/magneto-encephalographic (EEG/MEG) devices, it has been possible to delve deep into the cognitive underpinnings of sarcasm understanding. Filik2014, using a series of eye-tracking and EEG experiments try to show that for unfamiliar ironies, the literal interpretation would be computed first. They also show that a mismatch with context would lead to a re-interpretation of the statement, as being ironic. Camblin2007103 show that in multi-sentence passages, discourse congruence has robust effects on eye movements. This also implies that disrupted processing occurs for discourse incongruent words, even though they are perfectly congruous at the sentence level. In our previous work BIBREF8 , we augment cognitive features, derived from eye-movement patterns of readers, with textual features to detect whether a human reader has realized the presence of sarcasm in text or not.\nThe recent advancements in the literature discussed above, motivate us to explore gaze-based cognition for sarcasm detection. As far as we know, our work is the first of its kind.\nEye-tracking Database for Sarcasm Analysis\nSarcasm often emanates from incongruity BIBREF9 , which enforces the brain to reanalyze it BIBREF10 . This, in turn, affects the way eyes move through the text. Hence, distinctive eye-movement patterns may be observed in the case of successful processing of sarcasm in text in contrast to literal texts. This hypothesis forms the crux of our method for sarcasm detection and we validate this using our previously released freely available sarcasm dataset BIBREF8 enriched with gaze information.\nDocument Description\nThe database consists of 1,000 short texts, each having 10-40 words. Out of these, 350 are sarcastic and are collected as follows: (a) 103 sentences are from two popular sarcastic quote websites, (b) 76 sarcastic short movie reviews are manually extracted from the Amazon Movie Corpus BIBREF11 by two linguists. (c) 171 tweets are downloaded using the hashtag #sarcasm from Twitter. The 650 non-sarcastic texts are either downloaded from Twitter or extracted from the Amazon Movie Review corpus. The sentences do not contain words/phrases that are highly topic or culture specific. The tweets were normalized to make them linguistically well formed to avoid difficulty in interpreting social media lingo. Every sentence in our dataset carries positive or negative opinion about specific \u201caspects\u201d. For example, the sentence \u201cThe movie is extremely well cast\u201d has positive sentiment about the aspect \u201ccast\u201d.\nThe annotators were seven graduate students with science and engineering background, and possess good English proficiency. They were given a set of instructions beforehand and are advised to seek clarifications before they proceed. The instructions mention the nature of the task, annotation input method, and necessity of head movement minimization during the experiment.\nTask Description\nThe task assigned to annotators was to read sentences one at a time and label them with with binary labels indicating the polarity (i.e., positive/negative). Note that, the participants were not instructed to annotate whether a sentence is sarcastic or not., to rule out the Priming Effect (i.e., if sarcasm is expected beforehand, processing incongruity becomes relatively easier BIBREF12 ). The setup ensures its \u201cecological validity\u201d in two ways: (1) Readers are not given any clue that they have to treat sarcasm with special attention. This is done by setting the task to polarity annotation (instead of sarcasm detection). (2) Sarcastic sentences are mixed with non sarcastic text, which does not give prior knowledge about whether the forthcoming text will be sarcastic or not.\nThe eye-tracking experiment is conducted by following the standard norms in eye-movement research BIBREF13 . At a time, one sentence is displayed to the reader along with the \u201caspect\u201d with respect to which the annotation has to be provided. While reading, an SR-Research Eyelink-1000 eye-tracker (monocular remote mode, sampling rate 500Hz) records several eye-movement parameters like fixations (a long stay of gaze) and saccade (quick jumping of gaze between two positions of rest) and pupil size.\nThe accuracy of polarity annotation varies between 72%-91% for sarcastic texts and 75%-91% for non-sarcastic text, showing the inherent difficulty of sentiment annotation, when sarcasm is present in the text under consideration. Annotation errors may be attributed to: (a) lack of patience/attention while reading, (b) issues related to text comprehension, and (c) confusion/indecisiveness caused due to lack of context.\nFor our analysis, we do not discard the incorrect annotations present in the database. Since our system eventually aims to involve online readers for sarcasm detection, it will be hard to segregate readers who misinterpret the text. We make a rational assumption that, for a particular text, most of the readers, from a fairly large population, will be able to identify sarcasm. Under this assumption, the eye-movement parameters, averaged across all readers in our setting, may not be significantly distorted by a few readers who would have failed to identify sarcasm. This assumption is applicable for both regular and multi-instance based classifiers explained in section SECREF6 .\nAnalysis of Eye-movement Data\nWe observe distinct behavior during sarcasm reading, by analyzing the \u201cfixation duration on the text\u201d (also referred to as \u201cdwell time\u201d in the literature) and \u201cscanpaths\u201d of the readers.\nVariation in the Average Fixation Duration per Word\nSince sarcasm in text can be expected to induce cognitive load, it is reasonable to believe that it would require more processing time BIBREF14 . Hence, fixation duration normalized over total word count should usually be higher for a sarcastic text than for a non-sarcastic one. We observe this for all participants in our dataset, with the average fixation duration per word for sarcastic texts being at least 1.5 times more than that of non-sarcastic texts. To test the statistical significance, we conduct a two-tailed t-test (assuming unequal variance) to compare the average fixation duration per word for sarcastic and non-sarcastic texts. The hypothesized mean difference is set to 0 and the error tolerance limit ( INLINEFORM0 ) is set to 0.05. The t-test analysis, presented in Table TABREF11 , shows that for all participants, a statistically significant difference exists between the average fixation duration per word for sarcasm (higher average fixation duration) and non-sarcasm (lower average fixation duration). This affirms that the presence of sarcasm affects the duration of fixation on words.\nIt is important to note that longer fixations may also be caused by other linguistic subtleties (such as difficult words, ambiguity and syntactically complex structures) causing delay in comprehension, or occulomotor control problems forcing readers to spend time adjusting eye-muscles. So, an elevated average fixation duration per word may not sufficiently indicate the presence of sarcasm. But we would also like to share that, for our dataset, when we considered readability (Flesch readability ease-score BIBREF15 ), number of words in a sentence and average character per word along with the sarcasm label as the predictors of average fixation duration following a linear mixed effect model BIBREF16 , sarcasm label turned out to be the most significant predictor with a maximum slope. This indicates that average fixation duration per word has a strong connection with the text being sarcastic, at least in our dataset.\nWe now analyze scanpaths to gain more insights into the sarcasm comprehension process.\nAnalysis of Scanpaths\nScanpaths are line-graphs that contain fixations as nodes and saccades as edges; the radii of the nodes represent the fixation duration. A scanpath corresponds to a participant's eye-movement pattern while reading a particular sentence. Figure FIGREF14 presents scanpaths of three participants for the sarcastic sentence S1 and the non-sarcastic sentence S2. The x-axis of the graph represents the sequence of words a reader reads, and the y-axis represents a temporal sequence in milliseconds.\nConsider a sarcastic text containing incongruous phrases A and B. Our qualitative scanpath-analysis reveals that scanpaths with respect to sarcasm processing have two typical characteristics. Often, a long regression - a saccade that goes to a previously visited segment - is observed when a reader starts reading B after skimming through A. In a few cases, the fixation duration on A and B are significantly higher than the average fixation duration per word. In sentence S1, we see long and multiple regressions from the two incongruous phrases \u201cmisconception\u201d and \u201ccherish\u201d, and a few instances where phrases \u201calways cherish\u201d and \u201coriginal misconception\u201d are fixated longer than usual. Such eye-movement behaviors are not seen for S2.\nThough sarcasm induces distinctive scanpaths like the ones depicted in Figure FIGREF14 in the observed examples, presence of such patterns is not sufficient to guarantee sarcasm; such patterns may also possibly arise from literal texts. We believe that a combination of linguistic features, readability of text and features derived from scanpaths would help discriminative machine learning models learn sarcasm better.\nFeatures for Sarcasm Detection\nWe describe the features used for sarcasm detection in Table . The features enlisted under lexical,implicit incongruity and explicit incongruity are borrowed from various literature (predominantly from joshi2015harnessing). These features are essential to separate sarcasm from other forms semantic incongruity in text (for example ambiguity arising from semantic ambiguity or from metaphors). Two additional textual features viz. readability and word count of the text are also taken under consideration. These features are used to reduce the effect of text hardness and text length on the eye-movement patterns.\nSimple Gaze Based Features\nReaders' eye-movement behavior, characterized by fixations, forward saccades, skips and regressions, can be directly quantified by simple statistical aggregation (i.e., either computing features for individual participants and then averaging or performing a multi-instance based learning as explained in section SECREF6 ). Since these eye-movement attributes relate to the cognitive process in reading BIBREF17 , we consider these as features in our model. Some of these features have been reported by sarcasmunderstandability for modeling sarcasm understandability of readers. However, as far as we know, these features are being introduced in NLP tasks like textual sarcasm detection for the first time. The values of these features are believed to increase with the increase in the degree of surprisal caused by incongruity in text (except skip count, which will decrease).\nComplex Gaze Based Features\nFor these features, we rely on a graph structure, namely \u201csaliency graphs\", derived from eye-gaze information and word sequences in the text.\nFor each reader and each sentence, we construct a \u201csaliency graph\u201d, representing the reader's attention characteristics. A saliency graph for a sentence INLINEFORM0 for a reader INLINEFORM1 , represented as INLINEFORM2 , is a graph with vertices ( INLINEFORM3 ) and edges ( INLINEFORM4 ) where each vertex INLINEFORM5 corresponds to a word in INLINEFORM6 (may not be unique) and there exists an edge INLINEFORM7 between vertices INLINEFORM8 and INLINEFORM9 if R performs at least one saccade between the words corresponding to INLINEFORM10 and INLINEFORM11 .\nFigure FIGREF15 shows an example of a saliency graph.A saliency graph may be weighted, but not necessarily connected, for a given text (as there may be words in the given text with no fixation on them). The \u201ccomplex\u201d gaze features derived from saliency graphs are also motivated by the theory of incongruity. For instance, Edge Density of a saliency graph increases with the number of distinct saccades, which could arise from the complexity caused by presence of sarcasm. Similarly, the highest weighted degree of a graph is expected to be higher, if the node corresponds to a phrase, incongruous to some other phrase in the text.\nThe Sarcasm Classifier\nWe interpret sarcasm detection as a binary classification problem. The training data constitutes 994 examples created using our eye-movement database for sarcasm detection. To check the effectiveness of our feature set, we observe the performance of multiple classification techniques on our dataset through a stratified 10-fold cross validation. We also compare the classification accuracy of our system and the best available systems proposed by riloff2013sarcasm and joshi2015harnessing on our dataset. Using Weka BIBREF18 and LibSVM BIBREF19 APIs, we implement the following classifiers:\nResults\nTable TABREF17 shows the classification results considering various feature combinations for different classifiers and other systems. These are:\nUnigram (with principal components of unigram feature vectors),\nSarcasm (the feature-set reported by joshi2015harnessing subsuming unigram features and features from other reported systems)\nGaze (the simple and complex cognitive features we introduce, along with readability and word count features), and\nGaze+Sarcasm (the complete set of features).\nFor all regular classifiers, the gaze features are averaged across participants and augmented with linguistic and sarcasm related features. For the MILR classifier, the gaze features derived from each participant are augmented with linguistic features and thus, a multi instance \u201cbag\u201d of features is formed for each sentence in the training data. This multi-instance dataset is given to an MILR classifier, which follows the standard multi instance assumption to derive class-labels for each bag.\nFor all the classifiers, our feature combination outperforms the baselines (considering only unigram features) as well as BIBREF3 , with the MILR classifier getting an F-score improvement of 3.7% and Kappa difference of 0.08. We also achieve an improvement of 2% over the baseline, using SVM classifier, when we employ our feature set. We also observe that the gaze features alone, also capture the differences between sarcasm and non-sarcasm classes with a high-precision but a low recall.\nTo see if the improvement obtained is statistically significant over the state-of-the art system with textual sarcasm features alone, we perform McNemar test. The output of the SVM classifier using only linguistic features used for sarcasm detection by joshi2015harnessing and the output of the MILR classifier with the complete set of features are compared, setting threshold INLINEFORM0 . There was a significant difference in the classifier's accuracy with p(two-tailed) = 0.02 with an odds-ratio of 1.43, showing that the classification accuracy improvement is unlikely to be observed by chance in 95% confidence interval.\nConsidering Reading Time as a Cognitive Feature along with Sarcasm Features\nOne may argue that, considering simple measures of reading effort like \u201creading time\u201d as cognitive feature instead of the expensive eye-tracking features for sarcasm detection may be a cost-effective solution.

Do not provide any explanation.\n\nArticle: Introduction\nIn the field of natural language processing (NLP), the most prevalent neural approach to obtaining sentence representations is to use recurrent neural networks (RNNs), where words in a sentence are processed in a sequential and recurrent manner. Along with their intuitive design, RNNs have shown outstanding performance across various NLP tasks e.g. language modeling BIBREF0 , BIBREF1 , machine translation BIBREF2 , BIBREF3 , BIBREF4 , text classification BIBREF5 , BIBREF6 , and parsing BIBREF7 , BIBREF8 .\nAmong several variants of the original RNN BIBREF9 , gated recurrent architectures such as long short-term memory (LSTM) BIBREF10 and gated recurrent unit (GRU) BIBREF2 have been accepted as de-facto standard choices for RNNs due to their capability of addressing the vanishing and exploding gradient problem and considering long-term dependencies. Gated RNNs achieve these properties by introducing additional gating units that learn to control the amount of information to be transferred or forgotten BIBREF11 , and are proven to work well without relying on complex optimization algorithms or careful initialization BIBREF12 .\nMeanwhile, the common practice for further enhancing the expressiveness of RNNs is to stack multiple RNN layers, each of which has distinct parameter sets (stacked RNN) BIBREF13 , BIBREF14 . In stacked RNNs, the hidden states of a layer are fed as input to the subsequent layer, and they are shown to work well due to increased depth BIBREF15 or their ability to capture hierarchical time series BIBREF16 which are inherent to the nature of the problem being modeled.\nHowever this setting of stacking RNNs might hinder the possibility of more sophisticated recurrence-based structures since the information from lower layers is simply treated as input to the next layer, rather than as another class of state that participates in core RNN computations. Especially for gated RNNs such as LSTMs and GRUs, this means that layer-to-layer connections cannot fully benefit from the carefully constructed gating mechanism used in temporal transitions. Some recent work on stacking RNNs suggests alternative methods that encourage direct and effective interaction between RNN layers by adding residual connections BIBREF17 , BIBREF18 , by shortcut connections BIBREF18 , BIBREF19 , or by using cell states of LSTMs BIBREF20 , BIBREF21 .\nIn this paper, we propose a method of constructing multi-layer LSTMs where cell states are used in controlling the vertical information flow. This system utilizes states from the left and the lower context equally in computation of the new state, thus the information from lower layers is elaborately filtered and reflected through a soft gating mechanism. Our method is easy-to-implement, effective, and can replace conventional stacked LSTMs without much modification of the overall architecture.\nWe call the proposed architecture Cell-aware Stacked LSTM, or CAS-LSTM, and evaluate our method on multiple benchmark datasets: SNLI BIBREF22 , MultiNLI BIBREF23 , Quora Question Pairs BIBREF24 , and SST BIBREF25 . From experiments we show that the CAS-LSTMs consistently outperform typical stacked LSTMs, opening the possibility of performance improvement of architectures that use stacked LSTMs.\nOur contribution is summarized as follows.\nThis paper is organized as follows. We give a detailed description about the proposed method in \u00a7 SECREF2 . Experimental results are given in \u00a7 SECREF3 . We study prior work related to our objective in \u00a7 SECREF4 and conclude in \u00a7 SECREF5 .\nModel Description\nIn this section, we give a detailed formulation of the architectures used in experiments.\nNotation\nThroughout this paper, we denote matrices as boldface capital letters ( INLINEFORM0 ), vectors as boldface lowercase letters ( INLINEFORM1 ), and scalars as normal italic letters ( INLINEFORM2 ). For LSTM states, we denote a hidden state as INLINEFORM3 and a cell state as INLINEFORM4 . Also, a layer index of INLINEFORM5 or INLINEFORM6 is denoted by superscript and a time index is denoted by a subscript, i.e. INLINEFORM7 indicates the hidden state at time INLINEFORM8 and layer INLINEFORM9 . INLINEFORM10 means the element-wise multiplication between two vectors. We write INLINEFORM11 -th component of vector INLINEFORM12 as INLINEFORM13 . All vectors are assumed to be column vectors.\nStacked LSTMs\nWhile there exist various versions of LSTM formulation, in this work we use the following, one of the most common versions: DISPLAYFORM0 DISPLAYFORM1\nwhere INLINEFORM0 , INLINEFORM1 , and INLINEFORM2 , INLINEFORM3 , INLINEFORM4 are trainable parameters. INLINEFORM5 and INLINEFORM6 are the sigmoid activation and the hyperbolic tangent activation function respectively. Also we assume that INLINEFORM7 where INLINEFORM8 is the INLINEFORM9 -th input to the network.\nThe input gate INLINEFORM0 and the forget gate INLINEFORM1 control the amount of information transmitted from INLINEFORM2 and INLINEFORM3 , the candidate cell state and the previous cell state, to the new cell state INLINEFORM4 . Similarly the output gate INLINEFORM5 soft-selects which portion of the cell state INLINEFORM6 is to be used in the final hidden state.\nWe can clearly see that cell states ( INLINEFORM0 , INLINEFORM1 , INLINEFORM2 ) play a crucial role in forming horizontal recurrence. However the current formulation does not consider INLINEFORM3 , the cell state from INLINEFORM4 -th layer, in computation and thus the lower context is reflected only through the rudimentary way, hindering the possibility of controlling vertical information flow.\nCell-aware Stacked LSTMs\nNow we extend the stacked LSTM formulation defined above to address the problem noted in the previous subsection. To enhance the interaction between layers in a way similar to how LSTMs keep and forget the information from the previous time step, we introduce the additional forget gate INLINEFORM0 that determines whether to accept or ignore the signals coming from the previous layer. Therefore the proposed Cell-aware Stacked LSTM is formulated as follows: DISPLAYFORM0 DISPLAYFORM1\nwhere INLINEFORM0 and INLINEFORM1 . INLINEFORM2 can either be a vector of constants or parameters. When INLINEFORM3 , the equations defined in the previous subsection are used. Therefore, it can be said that each non-bottom layer of CAS-LSTM accepts two sets of hidden and cell states\u2014one from the left context and the other from the below context. The left and the below context participate in computation with the equivalent procedure so that the information from lower layers can be efficiently propagated. Fig. FIGREF1 compares CAS-LSTM to the conventional stacked LSTM architecture, and Fig. FIGREF8 depicts the computation flow of the CAS-LSTM.\nWe argue that considering INLINEFORM0 in computation is beneficial for the following reasons. First, INLINEFORM1 contains additional information compared to INLINEFORM2 since it is not filtered by INLINEFORM3 . Thus a model that directly uses INLINEFORM4 does not rely solely on INLINEFORM5 for extracting information, due to the fact that it has access to the raw information INLINEFORM6 , as in temporal connections. In other words, INLINEFORM7 no longer has to take all responsibility for selecting useful features for both horizontal and vertical transitions, and the burden of selecting information is shared with INLINEFORM8 .\nAnother advantage of using the INLINEFORM0 lies in the fact that it directly connects INLINEFORM1 and INLINEFORM2 . This direct connection helps and stabilizes training, since the terminal error signals can be easily backpropagated to model parameters. Fig. FIGREF23 illustrates paths between the two cell states.\nWe find experimentally that there is little difference between letting INLINEFORM0 be constant and letting it be trainable parameters, thus we set INLINEFORM1 in all experiments. We also experimented with the architecture without INLINEFORM2 i.e. two cell states are combined by unweighted summation similar to multidimensional RNNs BIBREF27 , and found that it leads to performance degradation and unstable convergence, likely due to mismatch in the range of cell state values between layers ( INLINEFORM3 for the first layer and INLINEFORM4 for the others). Experimental results on various INLINEFORM5 are presented in \u00a7 SECREF3 .\nThe idea of having multiple states is also related to tree-structured RNNs BIBREF29 , BIBREF30 . Among them, tree-structured LSTMs (Tree-LSTMs) BIBREF31 , BIBREF32 , BIBREF33 are similar to ours in that they use both hidden and cell states from children nodes. In Tree-LSTMs, states for all children nodes are regarded as input, and they participate in the computation equally through weight-shared (in Child-Sum Tree-LSTMs) or weight-unshared (in INLINEFORM0 -ary Tree-LSTMs) projection. From this perspective, each CAS-LSTM layer (where INLINEFORM1 ) can be seen as a binary Tree-LSTM where the structures it operates on are fixed to right-branching trees. The use of cell state in computation could be one reason that Tree-LSTMs perform better than sequential LSTMs even when trivial trees (strictly left- or right-branching) are given BIBREF34 .\nMultidimensional RNNs (MDRNN) are an extension of 1D sequential RNNs that can accept multidimensional input e.g. images, and have been successfully applied to image segmentation BIBREF26 and handwriting recognition BIBREF27 . Notably multidimensional LSTMs (MDLSTM) BIBREF27 have an analogous formulation to ours except the INLINEFORM0 term and the fact that we use distinct weights per column (or `layer' in our case). From this view, CAS-LSTM can be seen as a certain kind of MDLSTM that accepts a 2D input INLINEFORM1 . Grid LSTMs BIBREF21 also take INLINEFORM2 inputs but emit INLINEFORM3 outputs, which is different from our case where a single set of hidden and cell states is produced.\nSentence Encoders\nThe sentence encoder network we use in our experiments takes INLINEFORM0 words (assumed to be one-hot vectors) as input. The words are projected to corresponding word representations: INLINEFORM1 where INLINEFORM2 . Then INLINEFORM3 is fed to a INLINEFORM4 -layer CAS-LSTM model, resulting in the representations INLINEFORM5 . The sentence representation, INLINEFORM6 , is computed by max-pooling INLINEFORM7 over time as in the work of BIBREF35 . Similar to their results, from preliminary experiments we found that the max-pooling performs consistently better than mean- and last-pooling.\nTo make models more expressive, a bidirectional CAS-LSTM network may also be used. In the bidirectional case, the forward representations INLINEFORM0 and the backward representations INLINEFORM1 are concatenated and max-pooled to yield the sentence representation INLINEFORM2 . We call this bidirectional architecture Bi-CAS-LSTM in experiments.\nTop-layer Classifiers\nFor the natural language inference experiments, we use the following heuristic function proposed by BIBREF36 in feature extraction: DISPLAYFORM0\nwhere INLINEFORM0 means vector concatenation, and INLINEFORM1 and INLINEFORM2 are applied element-wise.\nAnd we use the following function in paraphrase identification experiments: DISPLAYFORM0\nas in the work of BIBREF37 .\nFor sentiment classification, we use the sentence representation itself. DISPLAYFORM0\nWe feed the feature extracted from INLINEFORM0 as input to the MLP classifier with ReLU activation followed by the fully-connected softmax layer to predict the label distribution: DISPLAYFORM0\nwhere INLINEFORM0 , INLINEFORM1 is the number of label classes, and INLINEFORM2 the dimension of the MLP output,\nExperiments\nWe evaluate our method on natural language inference (NLI), paraphrase identification (PI), and sentiment classification. We also conduct analysis on gate values and experiments on model variants. For detailed experimental settings, we refer readers to the supplemental material.\nFor the NLI and PI tasks, there exists recent work specializing in sentence pair classification. However in this work we confine our model to the architecture that encodes each sentence using a shared encoder without any inter-sentence interaction, in order to focus on the effectiveness of the models in extracting semantics. But note that the applicability of CAS-LSTM is not limited to sentence encoding based approaches.\nNatural Language Inference\nFor the evaluation of performance of the proposed method on the NLI task, SNLI BIBREF22 and MultiNLI BIBREF23 datasets are used. The objective of both datasets is to predict the relationship between a premise and a hypothesis sentence: entailment, contradiction, and neutral. SNLI and MultiNLI datasets are composed of about 570k and 430k premise-hypothesis pairs respectively.\nGloVe pretrained word embeddings BIBREF49 are used and remain fixed during training. The dimension of encoder states ( INLINEFORM0 ) is set to 300 and a 1024D MLP with one or two hidden layers is used. We apply dropout BIBREF50 to the word embeddings and the MLP layers. The features used as input to the MLP classifier are extracted following Eq. EQREF28 .\nTable TABREF32 and TABREF33 contain results of the models on SNLI and MultiNLI datasets. In SNLI, our best model achieves the new state-of-the-art accuracy of 87.0% with relatively fewer parameters. Similarly in MultiNLI, our models match the accuracy of state-of-the-art models in both in-domain (matched) and cross-domain (mismatched) test sets. Note that only the GloVe word vectors are used as word representations, as opposed to some models that introduce character-level features. It is also notable that our proposed architecture does not restrict the selection of pooling method; the performance could further be improved by replacing max-pooling with other advanced algorithms e.g. intra-sentence attention BIBREF39 and generalized pooling BIBREF19 .\nParaphrase Identification\nWe use Quora Question Pairs dataset BIBREF24 in evaluating the performance of our method on the PI task. The dataset consists of over 400k question pairs, and each pair is annotated with whether the two sentences are paraphrase of each other or not.\nSimilar to the NLI experiments, GloVe pretrained vectors, 300D encoders, and 1024D MLP are used. The number of CAS-LSTM layers is fixed to 2 in PI experiments. Two sentence vectors are aggregated using Eq. EQREF29 and fed as input to the MLP. The results on the Quora Question Pairs dataset are summarized in Table TABREF34 . Again we can see that our models outperform other models by large margin, achieving the new state of the art.\nSentiment Classification\nIn evaluating sentiment classification performance, the Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST) BIBREF25 is used. It consists of about 12,000 binary-parsed sentences where constituents (phrases) of each parse tree are annotated with a sentiment label (very positive, positive, neutral, negative, very negative). Following the convention of prior work, all phrases and their labels are used in training but only the sentence-level data are used in evaluation.\nIn evaluation we consider two settings, namely SST-2 and SST-5, the two differing only in their level of granularity with regard to labels. In SST-2, data samples annotated with `neutral' are ignored from training and evaluation. The two positive labels (very positive, positive) are considered as the same label, and similarly for the two negative labels. As a result 98,794/872/1,821 data samples are used in training/validation/test, and the task is considered as a binary classification problem. In SST-5, data are used as-is and thus the task is a 5-class classification problem. All 318,582/1,101/2,210 data samples for training/validation/test are used in the SST-5 setting.\nWe use 300D GloVe vectors, 2-layer 150D or 300D encoders, and a 300D MLP classifier for the models, however unlike previous experiments we tune the word embeddings during training. The results on SST are listed in Table TABREF35 . Our models achieve the new state-of-the-art accuracy on SST-2 and competitive accuracy on SST-5, without utilizing parse tree information.\nForget Gate Analysis\nTo inspect the effect of the additional forget gate, we investigate how the values of vertical forget gates are distributed. We sample 1,000 random sentences from the development set of the SNLI dataset, and use the 3-layer CAS-LSTM model trained on the SNLI dataset to compute gate values.\nIf all values from a vertical forget gate INLINEFORM0 were to be 0, this would mean that the introduction of the additional forget gate is meaningless and the model would reduce to a plain stacked LSTM. On the contrary if all values were 1, meaning that the vertical forget gates were always open, it would be impossible to say that the information is modulated effectively.\nFig. FIGREF40 and FIGREF40 represent histograms of the vertical forget gate values from the second and the third layer. From the figures we can validate that the trained model does not fall into the degenerate case where vertical forget gates are ignored. Also the figures show that the values are right-skewed, which we conjecture to be a result of focusing more on a strong interaction between adjacent layers.\nTo further verify that the gate values are diverse enough within each time step, we compute the distribution of the range of values per time step, INLINEFORM0 , where INLINEFORM1 . We plot the histograms in Fig. FIGREF40 and FIGREF40 . From the figure we see that a vertical forget gate controls the amount of information flow effectively, making the decision of retaining or discarding signals.\nFinally, to investigate the argument presented in \u00a7 SECREF2 that the additional forget gate helps the previous output gate with reducing the burden of extracting all needed information, we inspect the distribution of the values from INLINEFORM0 . This distribution indicates how differently the vertical forget gate and the previous output gate select information from INLINEFORM1 . From Fig. FIGREF40 and FIGREF40 we can see that the two gates make fairly different decisions, from which we demonstrate that the direct path between INLINEFORM2 and INLINEFORM3 enables a model to utilize signals overlooked by INLINEFORM4 .\nModel Variations\nIn this subsection, we see the influence of each component of a model on performance by removing or replacing its components. the SNLI dataset is used for experiments, and the best performing configuration is used as a baseline for modifications. We consider the following variants: (i) models that use plain stacked LSTMs, (ii) models with different INLINEFORM0 , (iii) models without INLINEFORM1 , and (iv) models that integrate lower contexts via peephole connections.\nVariant (iv) integrates lower contexts via the following equations: DISPLAYFORM0 DISPLAYFORM1\nwhere INLINEFORM0 represent peephole weights that take cell states into account. Among the above equations, those that use the lower cell state INLINEFORM1 are Eq. EQREF52 and EQREF55 . We can see that INLINEFORM2 affects the value of INLINEFORM3 only via peephole connections, which makes INLINEFORM4 independent of INLINEFORM5 .\nTable TABREF36 summarizes the results of model variants. We can again see that the use of cell states clearly improves sentence modeling performance (baseline vs. (i) and (iv) vs. (i)). Also from the results of baseline and (ii), we validate that the selection of INLINEFORM0 does not significantly affect performance but introducing INLINEFORM1 is beneficial (baseline vs. (iii)) possibly due to its effect on normalizing information from multiple sources, as mentioned in \u00a7 SECREF2 . Finally, from the comparison between baseline and (iv), we show that the proposed way of combining the left and the lower contexts leads to better modeling of sentence representations than that of BIBREF20 in encoding sentences.\nConclusion\nIn this paper, we proposed a method of stacking multiple LSTM layers for modeling sentences, dubbed CAS-LSTM. It uses not only hidden states but also cell states from the previous layer, for the purpose of controlling the vertical information flow in a more elaborate way. We evaluated the proposed method on various benchmark tasks: natural language inference, paraphrase identification, and sentiment classification. Our models achieve the new state-of-the-art accuracy on SNLI and Quora Question Pairs datasets and obtain comparable results on MultiNLI and SST datasets. The proposed architecture can replace any stacked LSTM under one weak restriction\u2014the size of states should be identical across all layers.\nFor future work we plan to apply the CAS-LSTM architecture beyond sentence modeling tasks. Various problems e.g. sequence labeling, sequence generation, and language modeling might benefit from sophisticated modulation on context integration. Aggregating diverse contexts from sequential data, e.g. those from forward and backward reading of text, could also be an intriguing research direction.\nAcknowledgments\nWe thank Dan Edmiston for the review of the manuscript.\n\n Answer the question based on the above article as concisely as you can, using a single phrase or sentence if possible.

Along with their intuitive design, RNNs have shown outstanding performance across various NLP tasks e.g. language modeling BIBREF0 , BIBREF1 , machine translation BIBREF2 , BIBREF3 , BIBREF4 , text classification BIBREF5 , BIBREF6 , and parsing BIBREF7 , BIBREF8 .\nAmong several variants of the original RNN BIBREF9 , gated recurrent architectures such as long short-term memory (LSTM) BIBREF10 and gated recurrent unit (GRU) BIBREF2 have been accepted as de-facto standard choices for RNNs due to their capability of addressing the vanishing and exploding gradient problem and considering long-term dependencies. Gated RNNs achieve these properties by introducing additional gating units that learn to control the amount of information to be transferred or forgotten BIBREF11 , and are proven to work well without relying on complex optimization algorithms or careful initialization BIBREF12 .\nMeanwhile, the common practice for further enhancing the expressiveness of RNNs is to stack multiple RNN layers, each of which has distinct parameter sets (stacked RNN) BIBREF13 , BIBREF14 . In stacked RNNs, the hidden states of a layer are fed as input to the subsequent layer, and they are shown to work well due to increased depth BIBREF15 or their ability to capture hierarchical time series BIBREF16 which are inherent to the nature of the problem being modeled.\nHowever this setting of stacking RNNs might hinder the possibility of more sophisticated recurrence-based structures since the information from lower layers is simply treated as input to the next layer, rather than as another class of state that participates in core RNN computations. Especially for gated RNNs such as LSTMs and GRUs, this means that layer-to-layer connections cannot fully benefit from the carefully constructed gating mechanism used in temporal transitions. Some recent work on stacking RNNs suggests alternative methods that encourage direct and effective interaction between RNN layers by adding residual connections BIBREF17 , BIBREF18 , by shortcut connections BIBREF18 , BIBREF19 , or by using cell states of LSTMs BIBREF20 , BIBREF21 .\nIn this paper, we propose a method of constructing multi-layer LSTMs where cell states are used in controlling the vertical information flow. This system utilizes states from the left and the lower context equally in computation of the new state, thus the information from lower layers is elaborately filtered and reflected through a soft gating mechanism. Our method is easy-to-implement, effective, and can replace conventional stacked LSTMs without much modification of the overall architecture.\nWe call the proposed architecture Cell-aware Stacked LSTM, or CAS-LSTM, and evaluate our method on multiple benchmark datasets: SNLI BIBREF22 , MultiNLI BIBREF23 , Quora Question Pairs BIBREF24 , and SST BIBREF25 . From experiments we show that the CAS-LSTMs consistently outperform typical stacked LSTMs, opening the possibility of performance improvement of architectures that use stacked LSTMs.\nOur contribution is summarized as follows.\nThis paper is organized as follows. We give a detailed description about the proposed method in \u00a7 SECREF2 . Experimental results are given in \u00a7 SECREF3 . We study prior work related to our objective in \u00a7 SECREF4 and conclude in \u00a7 SECREF5 .\nModel Description\nIn this section, we give a detailed formulation of the architectures used in experiments.\nNotation\nThroughout this paper, we denote matrices as boldface capital letters ( INLINEFORM0 ), vectors as boldface lowercase letters ( INLINEFORM1 ), and scalars as normal italic letters ( INLINEFORM2 ). For LSTM states, we denote a hidden state as INLINEFORM3 and a cell state as INLINEFORM4 . Also, a layer index of INLINEFORM5 or INLINEFORM6 is denoted by superscript and a time index is denoted by a subscript, i.e. INLINEFORM7 indicates the hidden state at time INLINEFORM8 and layer INLINEFORM9 . INLINEFORM10 means the element-wise multiplication between two vectors. We write INLINEFORM11 -th component of vector INLINEFORM12 as INLINEFORM13 . All vectors are assumed to be column vectors.\nStacked LSTMs\nWhile there exist various versions of LSTM formulation, in this work we use the following, one of the most common versions: DISPLAYFORM0 DISPLAYFORM1\nwhere INLINEFORM0 , INLINEFORM1 , and INLINEFORM2 , INLINEFORM3 , INLINEFORM4 are trainable parameters. INLINEFORM5 and INLINEFORM6 are the sigmoid activation and the hyperbolic tangent activation function respectively. Also we assume that INLINEFORM7 where INLINEFORM8 is the INLINEFORM9 -th input to the network.\nThe input gate INLINEFORM0 and the forget gate INLINEFORM1 control the amount of information transmitted from INLINEFORM2 and INLINEFORM3 , the candidate cell state and the previous cell state, to the new cell state INLINEFORM4 . Similarly the output gate INLINEFORM5 soft-selects which portion of the cell state INLINEFORM6 is to be used in the final hidden state.\nWe can clearly see that cell states ( INLINEFORM0 , INLINEFORM1 , INLINEFORM2 ) play a crucial role in forming horizontal recurrence. However the current formulation does not consider INLINEFORM3 , the cell state from INLINEFORM4 -th layer, in computation and thus the lower context is reflected only through the rudimentary way, hindering the possibility of controlling vertical information flow.\nCell-aware Stacked LSTMs\nNow we extend the stacked LSTM formulation defined above to address the problem noted in the previous subsection. To enhance the interaction between layers in a way similar to how LSTMs keep and forget the information from the previous time step, we introduce the additional forget gate INLINEFORM0 that determines whether to accept or ignore the signals coming from the previous layer. Therefore the proposed Cell-aware Stacked LSTM is formulated as follows: DISPLAYFORM0 DISPLAYFORM1\nwhere INLINEFORM0 and INLINEFORM1 . INLINEFORM2 can either be a vector of constants or parameters. When INLINEFORM3 , the equations defined in the previous subsection are used. Therefore, it can be said that each non-bottom layer of CAS-LSTM accepts two sets of hidden and cell states\u2014one from the left context and the other from the below context. The left and the below context participate in computation with the equivalent procedure so that the information from lower layers can be efficiently propagated. Fig. FIGREF1 compares CAS-LSTM to the conventional stacked LSTM architecture, and Fig. FIGREF8 depicts the computation flow of the CAS-LSTM.\nWe argue that considering INLINEFORM0 in computation is beneficial for the following reasons. First, INLINEFORM1 contains additional information compared to INLINEFORM2 since it is not filtered by INLINEFORM3 . Thus a model that directly uses INLINEFORM4 does not rely solely on INLINEFORM5 for extracting information, due to the fact that it has access to the raw information INLINEFORM6 , as in temporal connections. In other words, INLINEFORM7 no longer has to take all responsibility for selecting useful features for both horizontal and vertical transitions, and the burden of selecting information is shared with INLINEFORM8 .\nAnother advantage of using the INLINEFORM0 lies in the fact that it directly connects INLINEFORM1 and INLINEFORM2 . This direct connection helps and stabilizes training, since the terminal error signals can be easily backpropagated to model parameters. Fig. FIGREF23 illustrates paths between the two cell states.\nWe find experimentally that there is little difference between letting INLINEFORM0 be constant and letting it be trainable parameters, thus we set INLINEFORM1 in all experiments. We also experimented with the architecture without INLINEFORM2 i.e. two cell states are combined by unweighted summation similar to multidimensional RNNs BIBREF27 , and found that it leads to performance degradation and unstable convergence, likely due to mismatch in the range of cell state values between layers ( INLINEFORM3 for the first layer and INLINEFORM4 for the others).

The use of cell state in computation could be one reason that Tree-LSTMs perform better than sequential LSTMs even when trivial trees (strictly left- or right-branching) are given BIBREF34 .\nMultidimensional RNNs (MDRNN) are an extension of 1D sequential RNNs that can accept multidimensional input e.g. images, and have been successfully applied to image segmentation BIBREF26 and handwriting recognition BIBREF27 . Notably multidimensional LSTMs (MDLSTM) BIBREF27 have an analogous formulation to ours except the INLINEFORM0 term and the fact that we use distinct weights per column (or `layer' in our case).

Grid LSTMs BIBREF21 also take INLINEFORM2 inputs but emit INLINEFORM3 outputs, which is different from our case where a single set of hidden and cell states is produced.\nSentence Encoders\nThe sentence encoder network we use in our experiments takes INLINEFORM0 words (assumed to be one-hot vectors) as input. The words are projected to corresponding word representations: INLINEFORM1 where INLINEFORM2 . Then INLINEFORM3 is fed to a INLINEFORM4 -layer CAS-LSTM model, resulting in the representations INLINEFORM5 . The sentence representation, INLINEFORM6 , is computed by max-pooling INLINEFORM7 over time as in the work of BIBREF35 . Similar to their results, from preliminary experiments we found that the max-pooling performs consistently better than mean- and last-pooling.\nTo make models more expressive, a bidirectional CAS-LSTM network may also be used. In the bidirectional case, the forward representations INLINEFORM0 and the backward representations INLINEFORM1 are concatenated and max-pooled to yield the sentence representation INLINEFORM2 . We call this bidirectional architecture Bi-CAS-LSTM in experiments.\nTop-layer Classifiers\nFor the natural language inference experiments, we use the following heuristic function proposed by BIBREF36 in feature extraction: DISPLAYFORM0\nwhere INLINEFORM0 means vector concatenation, and INLINEFORM1 and INLINEFORM2 are applied element-wise.\nAnd we use the following function in paraphrase identification experiments: DISPLAYFORM0\nas in the work of BIBREF37 .\nFor sentiment classification, we use the sentence representation itself. DISPLAYFORM0\nWe feed the feature extracted from INLINEFORM0 as input to the MLP classifier with ReLU activation followed by the fully-connected softmax layer to predict the label distribution: DISPLAYFORM0\nwhere INLINEFORM0 , INLINEFORM1 is the number of label classes, and INLINEFORM2 the dimension of the MLP output,\nExperiments\nWe evaluate our method on natural language inference (NLI), paraphrase identification (PI), and sentiment classification. We also conduct analysis on gate values and experiments on model variants. For detailed experimental settings, we refer readers to the supplemental material.\nFor the NLI and PI tasks, there exists recent work specializing in sentence pair classification. However in this work we confine our model to the architecture that encodes each sentence using a shared encoder without any inter-sentence interaction, in order to focus on the effectiveness of the models in extracting semantics. But note that the applicability of CAS-LSTM is not limited to sentence encoding based approaches.\nNatural Language Inference\nFor the evaluation of performance of the proposed method on the NLI task, SNLI BIBREF22 and MultiNLI BIBREF23 datasets are used. The objective of both datasets is to predict the relationship between a premise and a hypothesis sentence: entailment, contradiction, and neutral. SNLI and MultiNLI datasets are composed of about 570k and 430k premise-hypothesis pairs respectively.\nGloVe pretrained word embeddings BIBREF49 are used and remain fixed during training. The dimension of encoder states ( INLINEFORM0 ) is set to 300 and a 1024D MLP with one or two hidden layers is used. We apply dropout BIBREF50 to the word embeddings and the MLP layers. The features used as input to the MLP classifier are extracted following Eq. EQREF28 .\nTable TABREF32 and TABREF33 contain results of the models on SNLI and MultiNLI datasets. In SNLI, our best model achieves the new state-of-the-art accuracy of 87.0% with relatively fewer parameters. Similarly in MultiNLI, our models match the accuracy of state-of-the-art models in both in-domain (matched) and cross-domain (mismatched) test sets. Note that only the GloVe word vectors are used as word representations, as opposed to some models that introduce character-level features. It is also notable that our proposed architecture does not restrict the selection of pooling method; the performance could further be improved by replacing max-pooling with other advanced algorithms e.g. intra-sentence attention BIBREF39 and generalized pooling BIBREF19 .\nParaphrase Identification\nWe use Quora Question Pairs dataset BIBREF24 in evaluating the performance of our method on the PI task. The dataset consists of over 400k question pairs, and each pair is annotated with whether the two sentences are paraphrase of each other or not.\nSimilar to the NLI experiments, GloVe pretrained vectors, 300D encoders, and 1024D MLP are used. The number of CAS-LSTM layers is fixed to 2 in PI experiments. Two sentence vectors are aggregated using Eq. EQREF29 and fed as input to the MLP. The results on the Quora Question Pairs dataset are summarized in Table TABREF34 . Again we can see that our models outperform other models by large margin, achieving the new state of the art.\nSentiment Classification\nIn evaluating sentiment classification performance, the Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST) BIBREF25 is used. It consists of about 12,000 binary-parsed sentences where constituents (phrases) of each parse tree are annotated with a sentiment label (very positive, positive, neutral, negative, very negative). Following the convention of prior work, all phrases and their labels are used in training but only the sentence-level data are used in evaluation.\nIn evaluation we consider two settings, namely SST-2 and SST-5, the two differing only in their level of granularity with regard to labels. In SST-2, data samples annotated with `neutral' are ignored from training and evaluation. The two positive labels (very positive, positive) are considered as the same label, and similarly for the two negative labels. As a result 98,794/872/1,821 data samples are used in training/validation/test, and the task is considered as a binary classification problem. In SST-5, data are used as-is and thus the task is a 5-class classification problem. All 318,582/1,101/2,210 data samples for training/validation/test are used in the SST-5 setting.\nWe use 300D GloVe vectors, 2-layer 150D or 300D encoders, and a 300D MLP classifier for the models, however unlike previous experiments we tune the word embeddings during training. The results on SST are listed in Table TABREF35 . Our models achieve the new state-of-the-art accuracy on SST-2 and competitive accuracy on SST-5, without utilizing parse tree information.\nForget Gate Analysis\nTo inspect the effect of the additional forget gate, we investigate how the values of vertical forget gates are distributed. We sample 1,000 random sentences from the development set of the SNLI dataset, and use the 3-layer CAS-LSTM model trained on the SNLI dataset to compute gate values.\nIf all values from a vertical forget gate INLINEFORM0 were to be 0, this would mean that the introduction of the additional forget gate is meaningless and the model would reduce to a plain stacked LSTM. On the contrary if all values were 1, meaning that the vertical forget gates were always open, it would be impossible to say that the information is modulated effectively.\nFig. FIGREF40 and FIGREF40 represent histograms of the vertical forget gate values from the second and the third layer. From the figures we can validate that the trained model does not fall into the degenerate case where vertical forget gates are ignored. Also the figures show that the values are right-skewed, which we conjecture to be a result of focusing more on a strong interaction between adjacent layers.\nTo further verify that the gate values are diverse enough within each time step, we compute the distribution of the range of values per time step, INLINEFORM0 , where INLINEFORM1 . We plot the histograms in Fig. FIGREF40 and FIGREF40 . From the figure we see that a vertical forget gate controls the amount of information flow effectively, making the decision of retaining or discarding signals.\nFinally, to investigate the argument presented in \u00a7 SECREF2 that the additional forget gate helps the previous output gate with reducing the burden of extracting all needed information, we inspect the distribution of the values from INLINEFORM0 . This distribution indicates how differently the vertical forget gate and the previous output gate select information from INLINEFORM1 . From Fig. FIGREF40 and FIGREF40 we can see that the two gates make fairly different decisions, from which we demonstrate that the direct path between INLINEFORM2 and INLINEFORM3 enables a model to utilize signals overlooked by INLINEFORM4 .\nModel Variations\nIn this subsection, we see the influence of each component of a model on performance by removing or replacing its components. the SNLI dataset is used for experiments, and the best performing configuration is used as a baseline for modifications. We consider the following variants: (i) models that use plain stacked LSTMs, (ii) models with different INLINEFORM0 , (iii) models without INLINEFORM1 , and (iv) models that integrate lower contexts via peephole connections.\nVariant (iv) integrates lower contexts via the following equations: DISPLAYFORM0 DISPLAYFORM1\nwhere INLINEFORM0 represent peephole weights that take cell states into account. Among the above equations, those that use the lower cell state INLINEFORM1 are Eq. EQREF52 and EQREF55 . We can see that INLINEFORM2 affects the value of INLINEFORM3 only via peephole connections, which makes INLINEFORM4 independent of INLINEFORM5 .\nTable TABREF36 summarizes the results of model variants. We can again see that the use of cell states clearly improves sentence modeling performance (baseline vs. (i) and (iv) vs. (i)). Also from the results of baseline and (ii), we validate that the selection of INLINEFORM0 does not significantly affect performance but introducing INLINEFORM1 is beneficial (baseline vs. (iii)) possibly due to its effect on normalizing information from multiple sources, as mentioned in \u00a7 SECREF2 . Finally, from the comparison between baseline and (iv), we show that the proposed way of combining the left and the lower contexts leads to better modeling of sentence representations than that of BIBREF20 in encoding sentences.\nConclusion\nIn this paper, we proposed a method of stacking multiple LSTM layers for modeling sentences, dubbed CAS-LSTM. It uses not only hidden states but also cell states from the previous layer, for the purpose of controlling the vertical information flow in a more elaborate way. We evaluated the proposed method on various benchmark tasks: natural language inference, paraphrase identification, and sentiment classification. Our models achieve the new state-of-the-art accuracy on SNLI and Quora Question Pairs datasets and obtain comparable results on MultiNLI and SST datasets. The proposed architecture can replace any stacked LSTM under one weak restriction\u2014the size of states should be identical across all layers.\nFor future work we plan to apply the CAS-LSTM architecture beyond sentence modeling tasks. Various problems e.g. sequence labeling, sequence generation, and language modeling might benefit from sophisticated modulation on context integration. Aggregating diverse contexts from sequential data, e.g. those from forward and backward reading of text, could also be an intriguing research direction.\nAcknowledgments\nWe thank Dan Edmiston for the review of the manuscript.", "answers": ["(i) models that use plain stacked LSTMs, (ii) models with different INLINEFORM0, (iii) models without INLINEFORM1, (iv) models that integrate lower contexts via peephole connections"], "length": 3224, "dataset": "qasper_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "f4dd3a0b7e956fadae8f49e07a6ef1c6e90a315d21969a76", "pred": " The baselines were the best performing configurations used for modifications in the model variations."}

Do not provide any explanation.\n\nArticle: Introduction\nThis paper introduces jiant, an open source toolkit that allows researchers to quickly experiment on a wide array of NLU tasks, using state-of-the-art NLP models, and conduct experiments on probing, transfer learning, and multitask training. jiant supports many state-of-the-art Transformer-based models implemented by Huggingface's Transformers package, as well as non-Transformer models such as BiLSTMs.\nPackages and libraries like HuggingFace's Transformers BIBREF0 and AllenNLP BIBREF1 have accelerated the process of experimenting and iterating on NLP models by both abstracting out implementation details, and simplifying the model training pipeline. jiant extends the capabilities of both toolkits by presenting a wrapper that implements a variety of complex experimental pipelines in a scalable and easily controllable setting. jiant contains a task bank of over 50 tasks, including all the tasks presented in GLUE BIBREF2, SuperGLUE BIBREF3, the edge-probing suite BIBREF4, and the SentEval probing suite BIBREF5, as well as other individual tasks including CCG supertagging BIBREF6, SocialIQA BIBREF7, and CommonsenseQA BIBREF8. jiant is also the official baseline codebase for the SuperGLUE benchmark.\njiant's core design principles are:\nEase of use: jiant should allow users to run a variety of experiments using state-of-the-art models via an easy to use configuration-driven interface. jiant should also provide features that support correct and reproducible experiments, including logging and saving and restoring model state.\nAvailability of NLU tasks: jiant should maintain and continue to grow a collection of tasks useful for NLU research, especially popular evaluation tasks and tasks commonly used in pretraining and transfer learning.\nAvailability of cutting-edge models: jiant should make implementations of state-of-the-art models available for experimentation.\nOpen source: jiant should be free to use, and easy to contribute to.\nEarly versions of jiant have already been used in multiple works, including probing analyses BIBREF4, BIBREF9, BIBREF10, BIBREF11, BIBREF12, BIBREF13, transfer learning experiments BIBREF14, BIBREF15, and dataset and benchmark construction BIBREF3, BIBREF2, BIBREF16.\nBackground\nTransfer learning is an area of research that uses knowledge from pretrained models to transfer to new tasks. In recent years, Transformer-based models like BERT BIBREF17 and T5 BIBREF18 have yielded state-of-the-art results on the lion's share of benchmark tasks for language understanding through pretraining and transfer, often paired with some form of multitask learning.\njiant enables a variety of complex training pipelines through simple configuration changes, including multi-task training BIBREF19, BIBREF20 and pretraining, as well as the sequential fine-tuning approach from STILTs BIBREF15. In STILTs, intermediate task training takes a pretrained model like ELMo or BERT, and applies supplementary training on a set of intermediate tasks, before finally performing single-task training on additional downstream tasks.\njiant System Overview ::: Requirements\njiant v1.3.0 requires Python 3.5 or later. jiant can be installed via pip, or cloned and installed from GitHub. jiant's core dependencies are PyTorch BIBREF21, AllenNLP BIBREF1, and HuggingFace's Transformers BIBREF0. jiant is released under the MIT License BIBREF22.\njiant System Overview ::: jiant Components\nTasks: Tasks have references to task data, methods for processing data, references to classifier heads, and methods for calculating performance metrics, and making predictions.\nSentence Encoder: Sentence encoders map from the indexed examples to a sentence-level representation. Sentence encoders can include an input module (e.g., Transformer models, ELMo, or word embeddings), followed by an optional second layer of encoding (usually a BiLSTM). Examples of possible sentence encoder configurations include BERT, ELMo followed by a BiLSTM, BERT with a variety of pooling and aggregation metthods, or a bag of words model.\nTask-Specific Output Heads: Task-specific output modules map representations from sentence encoders to outputs specific to a task, e.g. entailment/neutral/contradiction for NLI tasks, or tags for part-of-speech tagging. They also include logic for computing the corresponding loss for training (e.g. cross-entropy).\nTrainer: Trainers manage the control flow for the training and validation loop for experiments. They sample batches from one or more tasks, perform forward and backward passes, calculate training metrics, evaluate on a validation set, and save checkpoints. Users can specify experiment-specific parameters such as learning rate, batch size, and more.\nConfig: Config files or flags are defined in HOCON format. Configs specify parameters for jiant experiments including choices of tasks, sentence encoder, and training routine.\nConfigs are jiant's primary user interface. Tasks and modeling components are designed to be modular, while jiant's pipeline is a monolithic, configuration-driven design intended to facilitate a number of common workflows outlined in SECREF17.\njiant System Overview ::: jiant Pipeline Overview\njiant's core pipeline consists of the five stages described below and illustrated in Figure FIGREF16:\nA config or multiple configs defining an experiment are interpreted. Users can choose and configure models, tasks, and stages of training and evaluation.\nThe tasks and sentence encoder are prepared:\nThe task data is loaded, tokenized, and indexed, and (optionally) the preprocessed task objects are serialized and cached. In this process, AllenNLP is used to create the vocabulary and index the tokenized data.\nThe sentence encoder is constructed and (optionally) pretrained weights are loaded.\nThe task-specific output heads are created for each task, and task heads are attached to a common sentence encoder. Optionally, different tasks can share the same output head, as in BIBREF20.\nOptionally, in the intermediate phase the trainer samples batches randomly from one or more tasks, and trains the shared model.\nOptionally, in the target training phase, a copy of the model is configured and trained or fine-tuned for each target task separately.\nOptionally, the model is evaluated on the validation and/or test sets of the target tasks.\njiant System Overview ::: Task and Model resources in jiant\njiant supports over 50 tasks. Task types include classification, regression, sequence generation, tagging, and span prediction. jiant focuses on NLU tasks like MNLI BIBREF24, CommonsenseQA BIBREF8, the Winograd Schema Challenge BIBREF25, and SQuAD BIBREF26. A full inventory of tasks and task variants is available in the jiant/tasks module.\njiant provides support for cutting-edge sentence encoder models, including support for Huggingface's Transformers. Supported models include: BERT BIBREF17, RoBERTa BIBREF27, XLNet BIBREF28, XLM BIBREF29, GPT BIBREF30, GPT-2 BIBREF31, ALBERT BIBREF32 and ELMo BIBREF33. jiant also supports the from-scratch training of (bidirectional) LSTMs BIBREF34 and deep bag of words models BIBREF35, as well as syntax-aware models such as PRPN BIBREF36 and ON-LSTM BIBREF37. jiant also supports word embeddings such as GloVe BIBREF38.\njiant System Overview ::: User Interface\njiant experiments can be run with a simple CLI:\njiant provides default config files that allow running many experiments without modifying source code.\njiant also provides baseline config files that can serve as a starting point for model development and evaluation against GLUE BIBREF2 and SuperGLUE BIBREF3 benchmarks.\nMore advanced configurations can be developed by composing multiple configurations files and overrides. Figure FIGREF29 shows a config file that overrides a default config, defining an experiment that uses BERT as the sentence encoder. This config includes an example of a task-specific configuration, which can be overridden in another config file or via a command line override.\njiant also implements the option to provide command line overrides with a flag. This option makes it easy to write scripts that launch jiant experiments over a range of parameters, for example while performing grid search across hyperparameters. jiant users have successfully run large-scale experiments launching hundreds of runs on both Kubernetes and Slurm.\njiant System Overview ::: Example jiant Use Cases and Options\nHere we highlight some example use cases and key corresponding jiant config options required in these experiments:\nFine-tune BERT on SWAG BIBREF39 and SQUAD BIBREF26, then fine-tune on HellaSwag BIBREF40:\nTrain a probing classifier over a frozen BERT model, as in BIBREF9:\nCompare performance of GloVe BIBREF38 embeddings using a BiLSTM:\nEvaluate ALBERT BIBREF32 on the MNLI BIBREF24 task:\njiant System Overview ::: jiant Deployment Environments\njiant runs on consumer-grade hardware or in cluster environments with or without CUDA GPUs. The jiant repository also contains documentation and configuration files demonstrating how to deploy jiant in Kubernetes clusters on Google Kubernetes Engine.\njiant System Overview ::: Logging and Metric Tracking\njiant generates custom log files that capture experimental configurations, training and evaluation metrics, and relevant run-time information.\njiant also generates TensorBoard event files BIBREF41 for training and evaluation metric tracking. TensorBoard event files can be visualized using the TensorBoard Scalars Dashboard.\njiant System Overview ::: Optimizations and Other Features\njiant implements features that improve run stability and efficiency:\njiant implements checkpointing options designed to offer efficient early stopping and to show consistent behavior when restarting after an interruption.\njiant caches preprocessed task data to speed up reuse across experiments which share common data resources and artifacts.\njiant implements gradient accumulation and multi-GPU, which enables training on larger batches than can fit in memory for a single GPU.\njiant supports outputting predictions in a format ready for GLUE and SuperGLUE benchmark submission.\njiant System Overview ::: Extensibility\njiant's design offers conveniences that reduce the need to modify code when making changes:\njiant's task registry makes it easy to define a new version of an existing task using different data. Once the new task is defined in the task registry, the task is available as an option in jiant's config.\njiant's sentence encoder and task output head abstractions allow for easy support of new sentence encoders.\nIn use cases requiring the introduction of a new task, users can use class inheritance to build on a number of available parent task types including classification, tagging, span prediction, span classification, sequence generation, regression, ranking, and multiple choice task classes. For these task types, corresponding task-specific output heads are already implemented.\nMore than 30 researchers and developers from more than 5 institutions have contributed code to the jiant project. jiant's maintainers welcome pull requests that introduce new tasks or sentence encoder components, and pull request are actively reviewed. The jiant repository's continuous integration system requires that all pull requests pass unit and integration tests and meet Black code formatting requirements.\njiant System Overview ::: Limitations\nWhile jiant is quite flexible in the pipelines that can be specified through configs, and some components are highly modular (e.g., tasks, sentence encoders, and output heads), modification of the pipeline code can be difficult. For example, training in more than two phases would require modifying the trainer code. Making multi-stage training configurations more flexible is on jiant's development roadmap.\njiant System Overview ::: jiant Development Roadmap\njiant is actively being developed. The jiant project has prioritized continuing to add support for new Transformer models and adding tasks that are commonly used for pretraining and evaluation in NLU, including sequence-to-sequence tasks.\nAdditionally, there are plans to make jiant's training phase configuration options more flexible to allow training in more than two phases, and to continue to refactor jiant's code to keep jiant flexible to track developments in NLU research.\nBenchmark Experiments\nTo benchmark jiant, we perform a set of experiments that reproduce external results for single fine-tuning and transfer learning experiments. jiant has been benchmarked extensively in both published and ongoing work on a majority of the implemented tasks.\nWe benchmark single-task fine-tuning configurations using CommonsenseQA BIBREF8 and SocialIQA BIBREF7. On CommonsenseQA with $\\mathrm {RoBERTa}_\\mathrm {LARGE}$, jiant achieves an accuracy of 0.722, comparable to 0.721 reported by BIBREF27. On SocialIQA with BERT-large, jiant achieves a dev set accuracy of 0.658, comparable to 0.66 reported in BIBREF7.\nNext, we benchmark jiant's transfer learning regime. We perform transfer experiments from MNLI to BoolQ with BERT-large. In this configuration BIBREF42 demonstrated an accuracy improvement of 0.78 to 0.82 on the dev set, and jiant achieves an improvement of 0.78 to 0.80.\nConclusion\njiant provides a configuration-driven interface for defining transfer learning and representation learning experiments using a bank of over 50 NLU tasks, cutting-edge sentence encoder models, and multi-task and multi-stage training procedures. Further, jiant is shown to be able to replicate published performance on various NLU tasks.\njiant's modular design of task and sentence encoder components make it possible for users to quickly and easily experiment with a large number of tasks, models, and parameter configurations, without editing source code. jiant's design also makes it easy to add new tasks, and jiant's architecture makes it convenient to extend jiant to support new sentence encoders.\njiant code is open source, and jiant invites contributors to open issues or submit pull request to the jiant project repository: https://github.com/nyu-mll/jiant.\nAcknowledgments\nKatherin Yu, Jan Hula, Patrick Xia, Raghu Pappagari, Shuning Jin, R.

As legal documents, they function using the principle of notice and choice BIBREF0, where companies post their policies, and theoretically, users read the policies and decide to use a company's products or services only if they find the conditions outlined in its privacy policy acceptable. Many legal jurisdictions around the world accept this framework, including the United States and the European Union BIBREF1, BIBREF2. However, the legitimacy of this framework depends upon users actually reading and understanding privacy policies to determine whether company practices are acceptable to them BIBREF3. In practice this is seldom the case BIBREF4, BIBREF5, BIBREF6, BIBREF7, BIBREF8, BIBREF9, BIBREF10. This is further complicated by the highly individual and nuanced compromises that users are willing to make with their data BIBREF11, discouraging a `one-size-fits-all' approach to notice of data practices in privacy documents.\nWith devices constantly monitoring our environment, including our personal space and our bodies, lack of awareness of how our data is being used easily leads to problematic situations where users are outraged by information misuse, but companies insist that users have consented. The discovery of increasingly egregious uses of data by companies, such as the scandals involving Facebook and Cambridge Analytica BIBREF12, have further brought public attention to the privacy concerns of the internet and ubiquitous computing. This makes privacy a well-motivated application domain for NLP researchers, where advances in enabling users to quickly identify the privacy issues most salient to them can potentially have large real-world impact.\n[1]https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gotokeep.keep.intl [2]https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.viber.voip [3]A question might not have any supporting evidence for an answer within the privacy policy.\nMotivated by this need, we contribute PrivacyQA, a corpus consisting of 1750 questions about the contents of privacy policies, paired with over 3500 expert annotations. The goal of this effort is to kickstart the development of question-answering methods for this domain, to address the (unrealistic) expectation that a large population should be reading many policies per day. In doing so, we identify several understudied challenges to our ability to answer these questions, with broad implications for systems seeking to serve users' information-seeking intent. By releasing this resource, we hope to provide an impetus to develop systems capable of language understanding in this increasingly important domain.\nRelated Work\nPrior work has aimed to make privacy policies easier to understand. Prescriptive approaches towards communicating privacy information BIBREF21, BIBREF22, BIBREF23 have not been widely adopted by industry. Recently, there have been significant research effort devoted to understanding privacy policies by leveraging NLP techniques BIBREF24, BIBREF25, BIBREF26, BIBREF27, BIBREF28, especially by identifying specific data practices within a privacy policy. We adopt a personalized approach to understanding privacy policies, that allows users to query a document and selectively explore content salient to them. Most similar is the PolisisQA corpus BIBREF29, which examines questions users ask corporations on Twitter. Our approach differs in several ways: 1) The PrivacyQA dataset is larger, containing 10x as many questions and answers. 2) Answers are formulated by domain experts with legal training. 3) PrivacyQA includes diverse question types, including unanswerable and subjective questions.\nOur work is also related to reading comprehension in the open domain, which is frequently based upon Wikipedia passages BIBREF16, BIBREF17, BIBREF15, BIBREF30 and news articles BIBREF20, BIBREF31, BIBREF32. Table.TABREF4 presents the desirable attributes our dataset shares with past approaches. This work is also tied into research in applying NLP approaches to legal documents BIBREF33, BIBREF34, BIBREF35, BIBREF36, BIBREF37, BIBREF38, BIBREF39. While privacy policies have legal implications, their intended audience consists of the general public rather than individuals with legal expertise. This arrangement is problematic because the entities that write privacy policies often have different goals than the audience. feng2015applying, tan-EtAl:2016:P16-1 examine question answering in the insurance domain, another specialized domain similar to privacy, where the intended audience is the general public.\nData Collection\nWe describe the data collection methodology used to construct PrivacyQA. With the goal of achieving broad coverage across application types, we collect privacy policies from 35 mobile applications representing a number of different categories in the Google Play Store. One of our goals is to include both policies from well-known applications, which are likely to have carefully-constructed privacy policies, and lesser-known applications with smaller install bases, whose policies might be considerably less sophisticated. Thus, setting 5 million installs as a threshold, we ensure each category includes applications with installs on both sides of this threshold. All policies included in the corpus are in English, and were collected before April 1, 2018, predating many companies' GDPR-focused BIBREF41 updates. We leave it to future studies BIBREF42 to look at the impact of the GDPR (e.g., to what extent GDPR requirements contribute to making it possible to provide users with more informative answers, and to what extent their disclosures continue to omit issues that matter to users).\nData Collection ::: Crowdsourced Question Elicitation\nThe intended audience for privacy policies consists of the general public. This informs the decision to elicit questions from crowdworkers on the contents of privacy policies. We choose not to show the contents of privacy policies to crowdworkers, a procedure motivated by a desire to avoid inadvertent biases BIBREF43, BIBREF44, BIBREF45, BIBREF46, BIBREF47, and encourage crowdworkers to ask a variety of questions beyond only asking questions based on practices described in the document.\nInstead, crowdworkers are presented with public information about a mobile application available on the Google Play Store including its name, description and navigable screenshots. Figure FIGREF9 shows an example of our user interface. Crowdworkers are asked to imagine they have access to a trusted third-party privacy assistant, to whom they can ask any privacy question about a given mobile application. We use the Amazon Mechanical Turk platform and recruit crowdworkers who have been conferred \u201cmaster\u201d status and are located within the United States of America. Turkers are asked to provide five questions per mobile application, and are paid $2 per assignment, taking ~eight minutes to complete the task.\nData Collection ::: Answer Selection\nTo identify legally sound answers, we recruit seven experts with legal training to construct answers to Turker questions. Experts identify relevant evidence within the privacy policy, as well as provide meta-annotation on the question's relevance, subjectivity, OPP-115 category BIBREF49, and how likely any privacy policy is to contain the answer to the question asked.\nData Collection ::: Analysis\nTable.TABREF17 presents aggregate statistics of the PrivacyQA dataset. 1750 questions are posed to our imaginary privacy assistant over 35 mobile applications and their associated privacy documents. As an initial step, we formulate the problem of answering user questions as an extractive sentence selection task, ignoring for now background knowledge, statistical data and legal expertise that could otherwise be brought to bear. The dataset is partitioned into a training set featuring 27 mobile applications and 1350 questions, and a test set consisting of 400 questions over 8 policy documents. This ensures that documents in training and test splits are mutually exclusive. Every question is answered by at least one expert. In addition, in order to estimate annotation reliability and provide for better evaluation, every question in the test set is answered by at least two additional experts.\nTable TABREF14 describes the distribution over first words of questions posed by crowdworkers. We also observe low redundancy in the questions posed by crowdworkers over each policy, with each policy receiving ~49.94 unique questions despite crowdworkers independently posing questions. Questions are on average 8.4 words long. As declining to answer a question can be a legally sound response but is seldom practically useful, answers to questions where a minority of experts abstain to answer are filtered from the dataset. Privacy policies are ~3000 words long on average. The answers to the question asked by the users typically have ~100 words of evidence in the privacy policy document.\nData Collection ::: Analysis ::: Categories of Questions\nQuestions are organized under nine categories from the OPP-115 Corpus annotation scheme BIBREF49:\nFirst Party Collection/Use: What, why and how information is collected by the service provider\nThird Party Sharing/Collection: What, why and how information shared with or collected by third parties\nData Security: Protection measures for user information\nData Retention: How long user information will be stored\nUser Choice/Control: Control options available to users\nUser Access, Edit and Deletion: If/how users can access, edit or delete information\nPolicy Change: Informing users if policy information has been changed\nInternational and Specific Audiences: Practices pertaining to a specific group of users\nOther: General text, contact information or practices not covered by other categories.\nFor each question, domain experts indicate one or more relevant OPP-115 categories. We mark a category as relevant to a question if it is identified as such by at least two annotators. If no such category exists, the category is marked as `Other' if atleast one annotator has identified the `Other' category to be relevant. If neither of these conditions is satisfied, we label the question as having no agreement. The distribution of questions in the corpus across OPP-115 categories is as shown in Table.TABREF16. First party and third party related questions are the largest categories, forming nearly 66.4% of all questions asked to the privacy assistant.\nData Collection ::: Analysis ::: Answer Validation\nWhen do experts disagree? We would like to analyze the reasons for potential disagreement on the annotation task, to ensure disagreements arise due to valid differences in opinion rather than lack of adequate specification in annotation guidelines. It is important to note that the annotators are experts rather than crowdworkers. Accordingly, their judgements can be considered valid, legally-informed opinions even when their perspectives differ. For the sake of this question we randomly sample 100 instances in the test data and analyze them for likely reasons for disagreements. We consider a disagreement to have occurred when more than one expert does not agree with the majority consensus. By disagreement we mean there is no overlap between the text identified as relevant by one expert and another.\nWe find that the annotators agree on the answer for 74% of the questions, even if the supporting evidence they identify is not identical i.e full overlap. They disagree on the remaining 26%. Sources of apparent disagreement correspond to situations when different experts: have differing interpretations of question intent (11%) (for example, when a user asks 'who can contact me through the app', the questions admits multiple interpretations, including seeking information about the features of the app, asking about first party collection/use of data or asking about third party collection/use of data), identify different sources of evidence for questions that ask if a practice is performed or not (4%), have differing interpretations of policy content (3%), identify a partial answer to a question in the privacy policy (2%) (for example, when the user asks `who is allowed to use the app' a majority of our annotators decline to answer, but the remaining annotators highlight partial evidence in the privacy policy which states that children under the age of 13 are not allowed to use the app), and other legitimate sources of disagreement (6%) which include personal subjective views of the annotators (for example, when the user asks `is my DNA information used in any way other than what is specified', some experts consider the boilerplate text of the privacy policy which states that it abides to practices described in the policy document as sufficient evidence to answer this question, whereas others do not).\nExperimental Setup\nWe evaluate the ability of machine learning methods to identify relevant evidence for questions in the privacy domain. We establish baselines for the subtask of deciding on the answerability (\u00a7SECREF33) of a question, as well as the overall task of identifying evidence for questions from policies (\u00a7SECREF37). We describe aspects of the question that can render it unanswerable within the privacy domain (\u00a7SECREF41).\nExperimental Setup ::: Answerability Identification Baselines\nWe define answerability identification as a binary classification task, evaluating model ability to predict if a question can be answered, given a question in isolation. This can serve as a prior for downstream question-answering. We describe three baselines on the answerability task, and find they considerably improve performance over a majority-class baseline.\nSVM: We define 3 sets of features to characterize each question. The first is a simple bag-of-words set of features over the question (SVM-BOW), the second is bag-of-words features of the question as well as length of the question in words (SVM-BOW + LEN), and lastly we extract bag-of-words features, length of the question in words as well as part-of-speech tags for the question (SVM-BOW + LEN + POS). This results in vectors of 200, 201 and 228 dimensions respectively, which are provided to an SVM with a linear kernel.\nCNN: We utilize a CNN neural encoder for answerability prediction. We use GloVe word embeddings BIBREF50, and a filter size of 5 with 64 filters to encode questions.\nBERT: BERT BIBREF51 is a bidirectional transformer-based language-model BIBREF52. We fine-tune BERT-base on our binary answerability identification task with a learning rate of 2e-5 for 3 epochs, with a maximum sequence length of 128.\nExperimental Setup ::: Privacy Question Answering\nOur goal is to identify evidence within a privacy policy for questions asked by a user. This is framed as an answer sentence selection task, where models identify a set of evidence sentences from all candidate sentences in each policy.\nExperimental Setup ::: Privacy Question Answering ::: Evaluation Metric\nOur evaluation metric for answer-sentence selection is sentence-level F1, implemented similar to BIBREF30, BIBREF16. Precision and recall are implemented by measuring the overlap between predicted sentences and sets of gold-reference sentences. We report the average of the maximum F1 from each n$-$1 subset, in relation to the heldout reference.\nExperimental Setup ::: Privacy Question Answering ::: Baselines\nWe describe baselines on this task, including a human performance baseline.\nNo-Answer Baseline (NA) : Most of the questions we receive are difficult to answer in a legally-sound way on the basis of information present in the privacy policy. We establish a simple baseline to quantify the effect of identifying every question as unanswerable.\nWord Count Baseline : To quantify the effect of using simple lexical matching to answer the questions, we retrieve the top candidate policy sentences for each question using a word count baseline BIBREF53, which counts the number of question words that also appear in a sentence. We include the top 2, 3 and 5 candidates as baselines.\nBERT: We implement two BERT-based baselines BIBREF51 for evidence identification. First, we train BERT on each query-policy sentence pair as a binary classification task to identify if the sentence is evidence for the question or not (Bert). We also experiment with a two-stage classifier, where we separately train the model on questions only to predict answerability. At inference time, if the answerable classifier predicts the question is answerable, the evidence identification classifier produces a set of candidate sentences (Bert + Unanswerable).\nHuman Performance: We pick each reference answer provided by an annotator, and compute the F1 with respect to the remaining references, as described in section 4.2.1. Each reference answer is treated as the prediction, and the remaining n-1 answers are treated as the gold reference. The average of the maximum F1 across all reference answers is computed as the human baseline.\nResults and Discussion\nThe results of the answerability baselines are presented in Table TABREF31, and on answer sentence selection in Table TABREF32. We observe that bert exhibits the best performance on a binary answerability identification task. However, most baselines considerably exceed the performance of a majority-class baseline. This suggests considerable information in the question, indicating it's possible answerability within this domain.\nTable.TABREF32 describes the performance of our baselines on the answer sentence selection task. The No-answer (NA) baseline performs at 28 F1, providing a lower bound on performance at this task. We observe that our best-performing baseline, Bert + Unanswerable achieves an F1 of 39.8. This suggest that bert is capable of making some progress towards answering questions in this difficult domain, while still leaving considerable headroom for improvement to reach human performance. Bert + Unanswerable performance suggests that incorporating information about answerability can help in this difficult domain. We examine this challenging phenomena of unanswerability further in Section .\nResults and Discussion ::: Error Analysis\nDisagreements are analyzed based on the OPP-115 categories of each question (Table.TABREF34). We compare our best performing BERT variant against the NA model and human performance. We observe significant room for improvement across all categories of questions but especially for first party, third party and data retention categories.\nWe analyze the performance of our strongest BERT variant, to identify classes of errors and directions for future improvement (Table.8). We observe that a majority of answerability mistakes made by the BERT model are questions which are in fact answerable, but are identified as unanswerable by BERT. We observe that BERT makes 124 such mistakes on the test set. We collect expert judgments on relevance, subjectivity , silence and information about how likely the question is to be answered from the privacy policy from our experts. We find that most of these mistakes are relevant questions. However many of them were identified as subjective by the annotators, and at least one annotator marked 19 of these questions as having no answer within the privacy policy. However, only 6 of these questions were unexpected or do not usually have an answer in privacy policies. These findings suggest that a more nuanced understanding of answerability might help improve model performance in his challenging domain.\nResults and Discussion ::: What makes Questions Unanswerable?\nWe further ask legal experts to identify potential causes of unanswerability of questions. This analysis has considerable implications. While past work BIBREF17 has treated unanswerable questions as homogeneous, a question answering system might wish to have different treatments for different categories of `unanswerable' questions. The following factors were identified to play a role in unanswerability:\nIncomprehensibility: If a question is incomprehensible to the extent that its meaning is not intelligible.\nRelevance: Is this question in the scope of what could be answered by reading the privacy policy.\nIll-formedness: Is this question ambiguous or vague. An ambiguous statement will typically contain expressions that can refer to multiple potential explanations, whereas a vague statement carries a concept with an unclear or soft definition.\nSilence: Other policies answer this type of question but this one does not.\nAtypicality: The question is of a nature such that it is unlikely for any policy policy to have an answer to the question.\nOur experts attempt to identify the different `unanswerable' factors for all 573 such questions in the corpus. 4.18% of the questions were identified as being incomprehensible (for example, `any difficulties to occupy the privacy assistant'). Amongst the comprehendable questions, 50% were identified as likely to have an answer within the privacy policy, 33.1% were identified as being privacy-related questions but not within the scope of a privacy policy (e.g., 'has Viber had any privacy breaches in the past?') and 16.9% of questions were identified as completely out-of-scope (e.g., `'will the app consume much space?'). In the questions identified as relevant, 32% were ill-formed questions that were phrased by the user in a manner considered vague or ambiguous. Of the questions that were both relevant as well as `well-formed', 95.7% of the questions were not answered by the policy in question but it was reasonable to expect that a privacy policy would contain an answer. The remaining 4.3% were described as reasonable questions, but of a nature generally not discussed in privacy policies. This suggests that the answerability of questions over privacy policies is a complex issue, and future systems should consider each of these factors when serving user's information seeking intent.\nWe examine a large-scale dataset of \u201cnatural\u201d unanswerable questions BIBREF54 based on real user search engine queries to identify if similar unanswerability factors exist. It is important to note that these questions have previously been filtered, according to a criteria for bad questions defined as \u201c(questions that are) ambiguous, incomprehensible, dependent on clear false presuppositions, opinion-seeking, or not clearly a request for factual information.\u201d Annotators made the decision based on the content of the question without viewing the equivalent Wikipedia page. We randomly sample 100 questions from the development set which were identified as unanswerable, and find that 20% of the questions are not questions (e.g., \u201call I want for christmas is you mariah carey tour\u201d). 12% of questions are unlikely to ever contain an answer on Wikipedia, corresponding closely to our atypicality category. 3% of questions are unlikely to have an answer anywhere (e.g., `what guides Santa home after he has delivered presents?'). 7% of questions are incomplete or open-ended (e.g., `the south west wind blows across nigeria between'). 3% of questions have an unresolvable coreference (e.g., `how do i get to Warsaw Missouri from here'). 4% of questions are vague, and a further 7% have unknown sources of error. 2% still contain false presuppositions (e.g., `what is the only fruit that does not have seeds?') and the remaining 42% do not have an answer within the document. This reinforces our belief that though they have been understudied in past work, any question answering system interacting with real users should expect to receive such unanticipated and unanswerable questions.\nConclusion\nWe present PrivacyQA, the first significant corpus of privacy policy questions and more than 3500 expert annotations of relevant answers. The goal of this work is to promote question-answering research in the specialized privacy domain, where it can have large real-world impact. Strong neural baselines on PrivacyQA achieve a performance of only 39.8 F1 on this corpus, indicating considerable room for future research. Further, we shed light on several important considerations that affect the answerability of questions. We hope this contribution leads to multidisciplinary efforts to precisely understand user intent and reconcile it with information in policy documents, from both the privacy and NLP communities.\nAcknowledgements\nThis research was supported in part by grants from the National Science Foundation Secure and Trustworthy Computing program (CNS-1330596, CNS-1330214, CNS-15-13957, CNS-1801316, CNS-1914486, CNS-1914444) and a DARPA Brandeis grant on Personalized Privacy Assistants (FA8750-15-2-0277).

As legal documents, they function using the principle of notice and choice BIBREF0, where companies post their policies, and theoretically, users read the policies and decide to use a company's products or services only if they find the conditions outlined in its privacy policy acceptable. Many legal jurisdictions around the world accept this framework, including the United States and the European Union BIBREF1, BIBREF2. However, the legitimacy of this framework depends upon users actually reading and understanding privacy policies to determine whether company practices are acceptable to them BIBREF3. In practice this is seldom the case BIBREF4, BIBREF5, BIBREF6, BIBREF7, BIBREF8, BIBREF9, BIBREF10. This is further complicated by the highly individual and nuanced compromises that users are willing to make with their data BIBREF11, discouraging a `one-size-fits-all' approach to notice of data practices in privacy documents.\nWith devices constantly monitoring our environment, including our personal space and our bodies, lack of awareness of how our data is being used easily leads to problematic situations where users are outraged by information misuse, but companies insist that users have consented.

Sources of apparent disagreement correspond to situations when different experts: have differing interpretations of question intent (11%) (for example, when a user asks 'who can contact me through the app', the questions admits multiple interpretations, including seeking information about the features of the app, asking about first party collection/use of data or asking about third party collection/use of data), identify different sources of evidence for questions that ask if a practice is performed or not (4%), have differing interpretations of policy content (3%), identify a partial answer to a question in the privacy policy (2%) (for example, when the user asks `who is allowed to use the app' a majority of our annotators decline to answer, but the remaining annotators highlight partial evidence in the privacy policy which states that children under the age of 13 are not allowed to use the app), and other legitimate sources of disagreement (6%) which include personal subjective views of the annotators (for example, when the user asks `is my DNA information used in any way other than what is specified', some experts consider the boilerplate text of the privacy policy which states that it abides to practices described in the policy document as sufficient evidence to answer this question, whereas others do not).\nExperimental Setup\nWe evaluate the ability of machine learning methods to identify relevant evidence for questions in the privacy domain. We establish baselines for the subtask of deciding on the answerability (\u00a7SECREF33) of a question, as well as the overall task of identifying evidence for questions from policies (\u00a7SECREF37). We describe aspects of the question that can render it unanswerable within the privacy domain (\u00a7SECREF41).\nExperimental Setup ::: Answerability Identification Baselines\nWe define answerability identification as a binary classification task, evaluating model ability to predict if a question can be answered, given a question in isolation. This can serve as a prior for downstream question-answering. We describe three baselines on the answerability task, and find they considerably improve performance over a majority-class baseline.\nSVM: We define 3 sets of features to characterize each question. The first is a simple bag-of-words set of features over the question (SVM-BOW), the second is bag-of-words features of the question as well as length of the question in words (SVM-BOW + LEN), and lastly we extract bag-of-words features, length of the question in words as well as part-of-speech tags for the question (SVM-BOW + LEN + POS). This results in vectors of 200, 201 and 228 dimensions respectively, which are provided to an SVM with a linear kernel.\nCNN: We utilize a CNN neural encoder for answerability prediction. We use GloVe word embeddings BIBREF50, and a filter size of 5 with 64 filters to encode questions.\nBERT: BERT BIBREF51 is a bidirectional transformer-based language-model BIBREF52. We fine-tune BERT-base on our binary answerability identification task with a learning rate of 2e-5 for 3 epochs, with a maximum sequence length of 128.\nExperimental Setup ::: Privacy Question Answering\nOur goal is to identify evidence within a privacy policy for questions asked by a user. This is framed as an answer sentence selection task, where models identify a set of evidence sentences from all candidate sentences in each policy.\nExperimental Setup ::: Privacy Question Answering ::: Evaluation Metric\nOur evaluation metric for answer-sentence selection is sentence-level F1, implemented similar to BIBREF30, BIBREF16. Precision and recall are implemented by measuring the overlap between predicted sentences and sets of gold-reference sentences. We report the average of the maximum F1 from each n$-$1 subset, in relation to the heldout reference.\nExperimental Setup ::: Privacy Question Answering ::: Baselines\nWe describe baselines on this task, including a human performance baseline.\nNo-Answer Baseline (NA) : Most of the questions we receive are difficult to answer in a legally-sound way on the basis of information present in the privacy policy. We establish a simple baseline to quantify the effect of identifying every question as unanswerable.\nWord Count Baseline : To quantify the effect of using simple lexical matching to answer the questions, we retrieve the top candidate policy sentences for each question using a word count baseline BIBREF53, which counts the number of question words that also appear in a sentence. We include the top 2, 3 and 5 candidates as baselines.\nBERT: We implement two BERT-based baselines BIBREF51 for evidence identification. First, we train BERT on each query-policy sentence pair as a binary classification task to identify if the sentence is evidence for the question or not (Bert). We also experiment with a two-stage classifier, where we separately train the model on questions only to predict answerability. At inference time, if the answerable classifier predicts the question is answerable, the evidence identification classifier produces a set of candidate sentences (Bert + Unanswerable).\nHuman Performance: We pick each reference answer provided by an annotator, and compute the F1 with respect to the remaining references, as described in section 4.2.1. Each reference answer is treated as the prediction, and the remaining n-1 answers are treated as the gold reference. The average of the maximum F1 across all reference answers is computed as the human baseline.\nResults and Discussion\nThe results of the answerability baselines are presented in Table TABREF31, and on answer sentence selection in Table TABREF32. We observe that bert exhibits the best performance on a binary answerability identification task. However, most baselines considerably exceed the performance of a majority-class baseline. This suggests considerable information in the question, indicating it's possible answerability within this domain.\nTable.TABREF32 describes the performance of our baselines on the answer sentence selection task. The No-answer (NA) baseline performs at 28 F1, providing a lower bound on performance at this task. We observe that our best-performing baseline, Bert + Unanswerable achieves an F1 of 39.8. This suggest that bert is capable of making some progress towards answering questions in this difficult domain, while still leaving considerable headroom for improvement to reach human performance. Bert + Unanswerable performance suggests that incorporating information about answerability can help in this difficult domain. We examine this challenging phenomena of unanswerability further in Section .\nResults and Discussion ::: Error Analysis\nDisagreements are analyzed based on the OPP-115 categories of each question (Table.TABREF34). We compare our best performing BERT variant against the NA model and human performance. We observe significant room for improvement across all categories of questions but especially for first party, third party and data retention categories.\nWe analyze the performance of our strongest BERT variant, to identify classes of errors and directions for future improvement (Table.8). We observe that a majority of answerability mistakes made by the BERT model are questions which are in fact answerable, but are identified as unanswerable by BERT. We observe that BERT makes 124 such mistakes on the test set. We collect expert judgments on relevance, subjectivity , silence and information about how likely the question is to be answered from the privacy policy from our experts. We find that most of these mistakes are relevant questions. However many of them were identified as subjective by the annotators, and at least one annotator marked 19 of these questions as having no answer within the privacy policy. However, only 6 of these questions were unexpected or do not usually have an answer in privacy policies. These findings suggest that a more nuanced understanding of answerability might help improve model performance in his challenging domain.\nResults and Discussion ::: What makes Questions Unanswerable?\nWe further ask legal experts to identify potential causes of unanswerability of questions. This analysis has considerable implications. While past work BIBREF17 has treated unanswerable questions as homogeneous, a question answering system might wish to have different treatments for different categories of `unanswerable' questions. The following factors were identified to play a role in unanswerability:\nIncomprehensibility: If a question is incomprehensible to the extent that its meaning is not intelligible.\nRelevance: Is this question in the scope of what could be answered by reading the privacy policy.\nIll-formedness: Is this question ambiguous or vague. An ambiguous statement will typically contain expressions that can refer to multiple potential explanations, whereas a vague statement carries a concept with an unclear or soft definition.\nSilence: Other policies answer this type of question but this one does not.\nAtypicality: The question is of a nature such that it is unlikely for any policy policy to have an answer to the question.\nOur experts attempt to identify the different `unanswerable' factors for all 573 such questions in the corpus. 4.18% of the questions were identified as being incomprehensible (for example, `any difficulties to occupy the privacy assistant'). Amongst the comprehendable questions, 50% were identified as likely to have an answer within the privacy policy, 33.1% were identified as being privacy-related questions but not within the scope of a privacy policy (e.g., 'has Viber had any privacy breaches in the past?') and 16.9% of questions were identified as completely out-of-scope (e.g., `'will the app consume much space?'). In the questions identified as relevant, 32% were ill-formed questions that were phrased by the user in a manner considered vague or ambiguous. Of the questions that were both relevant as well as `well-formed', 95.7% of the questions were not answered by the policy in question but it was reasonable to expect that a privacy policy would contain an answer. The remaining 4.3% were described as reasonable questions, but of a nature generally not discussed in privacy policies. This suggests that the answerability of questions over privacy policies is a complex issue, and future systems should consider each of these factors when serving user's information seeking intent.\nWe examine a large-scale dataset of \u201cnatural\u201d unanswerable questions BIBREF54 based on real user search engine queries to identify if similar unanswerability factors exist. It is important to note that these questions have previously been filtered, according to a criteria for bad questions defined as \u201c(questions that are) ambiguous, incomprehensible, dependent on clear false presuppositions, opinion-seeking, or not clearly a request for factual information.\u201d Annotators made the decision based on the content of the question without viewing the equivalent Wikipedia page. We randomly sample 100 questions from the development set which were identified as unanswerable, and find that 20% of the questions are not questions (e.g., \u201call I want for christmas is you mariah carey tour\u201d). 12% of questions are unlikely to ever contain an answer on Wikipedia, corresponding closely to our atypicality category. 3% of questions are unlikely to have an answer anywhere (e.g., `what guides Santa home after he has delivered presents?'). 7% of questions are incomplete or open-ended (e.g., `the south west wind blows across nigeria between'). 3% of questions have an unresolvable coreference (e.g., `how do i get to Warsaw Missouri from here'). 4% of questions are vague, and a further 7% have unknown sources of error. 2% still contain false presuppositions (e.g., `what is the only fruit that does not have seeds?') and the remaining 42% do not have an answer within the document. This reinforces our belief that though they have been understudied in past work, any question answering system interacting with real users should expect to receive such unanticipated and unanswerable questions.\nConclusion\nWe present PrivacyQA, the first significant corpus of privacy policy questions and more than 3500 expert annotations of relevant answers. The goal of this work is to promote question-answering research in the specialized privacy domain, where it can have large real-world impact. Strong neural baselines on PrivacyQA achieve a performance of only 39.8 F1 on this corpus, indicating considerable room for future research. Further, we shed light on several important considerations that affect the answerability of questions. We hope this contribution leads to multidisciplinary efforts to precisely understand user intent and reconcile it with information in policy documents, from both the privacy and NLP communities.\nAcknowledgements\nThis research was supported in part by grants from the National Science Foundation Secure and Trustworthy Computing program (CNS-1330596, CNS-1330214, CNS-15-13957, CNS-1801316, CNS-1914486, CNS-1914444) and a DARPA Brandeis grant on Personalized Privacy Assistants (FA8750-15-2-0277).

Recent work has shown that downstream task performance may benefit from explicitly injecting a syntactic inductive bias into model architectures BIBREF6, even when cwrs are also used BIBREF7. However, high quality linguistic structure annotation at a large scale remains expensive\u2014a trade-off needs to be made between the quality of the annotations and the computational expense of obtaining them. Shallow syntactic structures (BIBREF8; also called chunk sequences) offer a viable middle ground, by providing a flat, non-hierarchical approximation to phrase-syntactic trees (see Fig. FIGREF1 for an example). These structures can be obtained efficiently, and with high accuracy, using sequence labelers. In this paper we consider shallow syntax to be a proxy for linguistic structure.\nWhile shallow syntactic chunks are almost as ubiquitous as part-of-speech tags in standard NLP pipelines BIBREF9, their relative merits in the presence of cwrs remain unclear. We investigate the role of these structures using two methods. First, we enhance the ELMo architecture BIBREF0 to allow pretraining on predicted shallow syntactic parses, instead of just raw text, so that contextual embeddings make use of shallow syntactic context (\u00a7SECREF2). Our second method involves classical addition of chunk features to cwr-infused architectures for four different downstream tasks (\u00a7SECREF3). Shallow syntactic information is obtained automatically using a highly accurate model (97% $F_1$ on standard benchmarks). In both settings, we observe only modest gains on three of the four downstream tasks relative to ELMo-only baselines (\u00a7SECREF4).\nRecent work has probed the knowledge encoded in cwrs and found they capture a surprisingly large amount of syntax BIBREF10, BIBREF1, BIBREF11. We further examine the contextual embeddings obtained from the enhanced architecture and a shallow syntactic context, using black-box probes from BIBREF1. Our analysis indicates that our shallow-syntax-aware contextual embeddings do not transfer to linguistic tasks any more easily than ELMo embeddings (\u00a7SECREF18).\nOverall, our findings show that while shallow syntax can be somewhat useful, ELMo-style pretraining discovers representations which make additional awareness of shallow syntax largely redundant.\nPretraining with Shallow Syntactic Annotations\nWe briefly review the shallow syntactic structures used in this work, and then present a model architecture to obtain embeddings from shallow Syntactic Context (mSynC).\nPretraining with Shallow Syntactic Annotations ::: Shallow Syntax\nBase phrase chunking is a cheap sequence-labeling\u2013based alternative to full syntactic parsing, where the sequence consists of non-overlapping labeled segments (Fig. FIGREF1 includes an example.) Full syntactic trees can be converted into such shallow syntactic chunk sequences using a deterministic procedure BIBREF9. BIBREF12 offered a rule-based transformation deriving non-overlapping chunks from phrase-structure trees as found in the Penn Treebank BIBREF13. The procedure percolates some syntactic phrase nodes from a phrase-syntactic tree to the phrase in the leaves of the tree. All overlapping embedded phrases are then removed, and the remainder of the phrase gets the percolated label\u2014this usually corresponds to the head word of the phrase.\nIn order to obtain shallow syntactic annotations on a large corpus, we train a BiLSTM-CRF model BIBREF14, BIBREF15, which achieves 97% $F_1$ on the CoNLL 2000 benchmark test set. The training data is obtained from the CoNLL 2000 shared task BIBREF12, as well as the remaining sections (except \u00a723 and \u00a720) of the Penn Treebank, using the official script for chunk generation. The standard task definition from the shared task includes eleven chunk labels, as shown in Table TABREF4.\nPretraining with Shallow Syntactic Annotations ::: Pretraining Objective\nTraditional language models are estimated to maximize the likelihood of each word $x_i$ given the words that precede it, $p(x_i \\mid x_{<i})$. Given a corpus that is annotated with shallow syntax, we propose to condition on both the preceding words and their annotations.\nWe associate with each word $x_i$ three additional variables (denoted $c_i$): the indices of the beginning and end of the last completed chunk before $x_i$, and its label. For example, in Fig. FIGREF8, $c_4=\\langle 3, 3, \\text{VP}\\rangle $ for $x_4=\\text{the}$. Chunks, $c$ are only used as conditioning context via $p(x_i \\mid x_{<i}, c_{\\leqslant i})$; they are not predicted. Because the $c$ labels depend on the entire sentence through the CRF chunker, conditioning each word's probability on any $c_i$ means that our model is, strictly speaking, not a language model, and it can no longer be meaningfully evaluated using perplexity.\nA right-to-left model is constructed analogously, conditioning on $c_{\\geqslant i}$ alongside $x_{>i}$. Following BIBREF2, we use a joint objective maximizing data likelihood objectives in both directions, with shared softmax parameters.\nPretraining with Shallow Syntactic Annotations ::: Pretraining Model Architecture\nOur model uses two encoders: $e_{\\mathit {seq}}$ for encoding the sequential history ($x_{<i}$), and $e_{\\mathit {syn}}$ for shallow syntactic (chunk) history ($c_{\\leqslant i}$). For both, we use transformers BIBREF16, which consist of large feedforward networks equipped with multiheaded self-attention mechanisms.\nAs inputs to $e_{\\mathit {seq}}$, we use a context-independent embedding, obtained from a CNN character encoder BIBREF17 for each token $x_i$. The outputs $h_i$ from $e_{\\mathit {seq}}$ represent words in context.\nNext, we build representations for (observed) chunks in the sentence by concatenating a learned embedding for the chunk label with $h$s for the boundaries and applying a linear projection ($f_\\mathit {proj}$). The output from $f_\\mathit {proj}$ is input to $e_{\\mathit {syn}}$, the shallow syntactic encoder, and results in contextualized chunk representations, $g$. Note that the number of chunks in the sentence is less than or equal to the number of tokens.\nEach $h_i$ is now concatentated with $g_{c_i}$, where $g_{c_i}$ corresponds to $c_i$, the last chunk before position $i$. Finally, the output is given by $\\mbox{\\textbf {mSynC}}_i = {u}_\\mathit {proj}(h_i, g_{c_i}) = W^\\top [h_i; g_{c_i}]$, where $W$ is a model parameter. For training, $\\mbox{\\textbf {mSynC}}_i$ is used to compute the probability of the next word, using a sampled softmax BIBREF18. For downstream tasks, we use a learned linear weighting of all layers in the encoders to obtain a task-specific mSynC, following BIBREF2.\nPretraining with Shallow Syntactic Annotations ::: Pretraining Model Architecture ::: Staged parameter updates\nJointly training both the sequential encoder $e_{\\mathit {seq}}$, and the syntactic encoder $e_{\\mathit {syn}}$ can be expensive, due to the large number of parameters involved. To reduce cost, we initialize our sequential cwrs $h$, using pretrained embeddings from ELMo-transformer. Once initialized as such, the encoder is fine-tuned to the data likelihood objective (\u00a7SECREF5). This results in a staged parameter update, which reduces training duration by a factor of 10 in our experiments. We discuss the empirical effect of this approach in \u00a7SECREF20.\nShallow Syntactic Features\nOur second approach incorporates shallow syntactic information in downstream tasks via token-level chunk label embeddings. Task training (and test) data is automatically chunked, and chunk boundary information is passed into the task model via BIOUL encoding of the labels. We add randomly initialized chunk label embeddings to task-specific input encoders, which are then fine-tuned for task-specific objectives. This approach does not require a shallow syntactic encoder or chunk annotations for pretraining cwrs, only a chunker. Hence, this can more directly measure the impact of shallow syntax for a given task.\nExperiments\nOur experiments evaluate the effect of shallow syntax, via contextualization (mSynC, \u00a7SECREF2) and features (\u00a7SECREF3). We provide comparisons with four baselines\u2014ELMo-transformer BIBREF0, our reimplementation of the same, as well as two cwr-free baselines, with and without shallow syntactic features. Both ELMo-transformer and mSynC are trained on the 1B word benchmark corpus BIBREF19; the latter also employs chunk annotations (\u00a7SECREF2). Experimental settings are detailed in Appendix \u00a7SECREF22.\nExperiments ::: Downstream Task Transfer\nWe employ four tasks to test the impact of shallow syntax. The first three, namely, coarse and fine-grained named entity recognition (NER), and constituency parsing, are span-based; the fourth is a sentence-level sentiment classification task. Following BIBREF2, we do not apply finetuning to task-specific architectures, allowing us to do a controlled comparison with ELMo. Given an identical base architecture across models for each task, we can attribute any difference in performance to the incorporation of shallow syntax or contextualization. Details of downstream architectures are provided below, and overall dataset statistics for all tasks is shown in the Appendix, Table TABREF26.\nExperiments ::: Downstream Task Transfer ::: NER\nWe use the English portion of the CoNLL 2003 dataset BIBREF20, which provides named entity annotations on newswire data across four different entity types (PER, LOC, ORG, MISC). A bidirectional LSTM-CRF architecture BIBREF14 and a BIOUL tagging scheme were used.\nExperiments ::: Downstream Task Transfer ::: Fine-grained NER\nThe same architecture and tagging scheme from above is also used to predict fine-grained entity annotations from OntoNotes 5.0 BIBREF21. There are 18 fine-grained NER labels in the dataset, including regular named entitities as well as entities such as date, time and common numerical entries.\nExperiments ::: Downstream Task Transfer ::: Phrase-structure parsing\nWe use the standard Penn Treebank splits, and adopt the span-based model from BIBREF22. Following their approach, we used predicted part-of-speech tags from the Stanford tagger BIBREF23 for training and testing. About 51% of phrase-syntactic constituents align exactly with the predicted chunks used, with a majority being single-width noun phrases. Given that the rule-based procedure used to obtain chunks only propagates the phrase type to the head-word and removes all overlapping phrases to the right, this is expected. We did not employ jack-knifing to obtain predicted chunks on PTB data; as a result there might be differences in the quality of shallow syntax annotations between the train and test portions of the data.\nExperiments ::: Downstream Task Transfer ::: Sentiment analysis\nWe consider fine-grained (5-class) classification on Stanford Sentiment Treebank BIBREF24. The labels are negative, somewhat_negative, neutral, positive and somewhat_positive. Our model was based on the biattentive classification network BIBREF25. We used all phrase lengths in the dataset for training, but test results are reported only on full sentences, following prior work.\nResults are shown in Table TABREF12. Consistent with previous findings, cwrs offer large improvements across all tasks. Though helpful to span-level task models without cwrs, shallow syntactic features offer little to no benefit to ELMo models. mSynC's performance is similar. This holds even for phrase-structure parsing, where (gold) chunks align with syntactic phrases, indicating that task-relevant signal learned from exposure to shallow syntax is already learned by ELMo. On sentiment classification, chunk features are slightly harmful on average (but variance is high); mSynC again performs similarly to ELMo-transformer. Overall, the performance differences across all tasks are small enough to infer that shallow syntax is not particularly helpful when using cwrs.\nExperiments ::: Linguistic Probes\nWe further analyze whether awareness of shallow syntax carries over to other linguistic tasks, via probes from BIBREF1. Probes are linear models trained on frozen cwrs to make predictions about linguistic (syntactic and semantic) properties of words and phrases. Unlike \u00a7SECREF11, there is minimal downstream task architecture, bringing into focus the transferability of cwrs, as opposed to task-specific adaptation.\nExperiments ::: Linguistic Probes ::: Probing Tasks\nThe ten different probing tasks we used include CCG supertagging BIBREF26, part-of-speech tagging from PTB BIBREF13 and EWT (Universal Depedencies BIBREF27), named entity recognition BIBREF20, base-phrase chunking BIBREF12, grammar error detection BIBREF28, semantic tagging BIBREF29, preposition supersense identification BIBREF30, and event factuality detection BIBREF31. Metrics and references for each are summarized in Table TABREF27. For more details, please see BIBREF1.\nResults in Table TABREF13 show ten probes. Again, we see the performance of baseline ELMo-transformer and mSynC are similar, with mSynC doing slightly worse on 7 out of 9 tasks. As we would expect, on the probe for predicting chunk tags, mSynC achieves 96.9 $F_1$ vs. 92.2 $F_1$ for ELMo-transformer, indicating that mSynC is indeed encoding shallow syntax. Overall, the results further confirm that explicit shallow syntax does not offer any benefits over ELMo-transformer.\nExperiments ::: Effect of Training Scheme\nWe test whether our staged parameter training (\u00a7SECREF9) is a viable alternative to an end-to-end training of both $e_{\\mathit {syn}}$ and $e_{\\mathit {seq}}$. We make a further distinction between fine-tuning $e_{\\mathit {seq}}$ vs. not updating it at all after initialization (frozen).\nDownstream validation-set $F_1$ on fine-grained NER, reported in Table TABREF21, shows that the end-to-end strategy lags behind the others, perhaps indicating the need to train longer than 10 epochs. However, a single epoch on the 1B-word benchmark takes 36 hours on 2 Tesla V100s, making this prohibitive. Interestingly, the frozen strategy, which takes the least amount of time to converge (24 hours on 1 Tesla V100), also performs almost as well as fine-tuning.\nConclusion\nWe find that exposing cwr-based models to shallow syntax, either through new cwr learning architectures or explicit pipelined features, has little effect on their performance, across several tasks. Linguistic probing also shows that cwrs aware of such structures do not improve task transferability. Our architecture and methods are general enough to be adapted for richer inductive biases, such as those given by full syntactic trees (RNNGs; BIBREF32), or to different pretraining objectives, such as masked language modeling (BERT; BIBREF5); we leave this pursuit to future work.\nSupplemental Material ::: Hyperparameters ::: ELMo-transformer\nOur baseline pretraining model was a reimplementation of that given in BIBREF0. Hyperparameters were generally identical, but we trained on only 2 GPUs with (up to) 4,000 tokens per batch. This difference in batch size meant we used 6,000 warm up steps with the learning rate schedule of BIBREF16.\nSupplemental Material ::: Hyperparameters ::: mSynC\nThe function $f_{seq}$ is identical to the 6-layer biLM used in ELMo-transformer. $f_{syn}$, on the other hand, uses only 2 layers. The learned embeddings for the chunk labels have 128 dimensions and are concatenated with the two boundary $h$ of dimension 512. Thus $f_{proj}$ maps $1024 + 128$ dimensions to 512. Further, we did not perform weight averaging over several checkpoints.\nSupplemental Material ::: Hyperparameters ::: Shallow Syntax\nThe size of the shallow syntactic feature embedding was 50 across all experiments, initialized uniform randomly.\nAll model implementations are based on the AllenNLP library BIBREF33.\n\n Answer the question based on the above article as concisely as you can, using a single phrase or sentence if possible. If the question cannot be answered based on the information in the article, write \"unanswerable\". If the question is a yes/no question, answer \"yes\", \"no\", or \"unanswerable\".

All overlapping embedded phrases are then removed, and the remainder of the phrase gets the percolated label\u2014this usually corresponds to the head word of the phrase.\nIn order to obtain shallow syntactic annotations on a large corpus, we train a BiLSTM-CRF model BIBREF14, BIBREF15, which achieves 97% $F_1$ on the CoNLL 2000 benchmark test set. The training data is obtained from the CoNLL 2000 shared task BIBREF12, as well as the remaining sections (except \u00a723 and \u00a720) of the Penn Treebank, using the official script for chunk generation. The standard task definition from the shared task includes eleven chunk labels, as shown in Table TABREF4.\nPretraining with Shallow Syntactic Annotations ::: Pretraining Objective\nTraditional language models are estimated to maximize the likelihood of each word $x_i$ given the words that precede it, $p(x_i \\mid x_{<i})$. Given a corpus that is annotated with shallow syntax, we propose to condition on both the preceding words and their annotations.\nWe associate with each word $x_i$ three additional variables (denoted $c_i$): the indices of the beginning and end of the last completed chunk before $x_i$, and its label. For example, in Fig. FIGREF8, $c_4=\\langle 3, 3, \\text{VP}\\rangle $ for $x_4=\\text{the}$. Chunks, $c$ are only used as conditioning context via $p(x_i \\mid x_{<i}, c_{\\leqslant i})$; they are not predicted. Because the $c$ labels depend on the entire sentence through the CRF chunker, conditioning each word's probability on any $c_i$ means that our model is, strictly speaking, not a language model, and it can no longer be meaningfully evaluated using perplexity.\nA right-to-left model is constructed analogously, conditioning on $c_{\\geqslant i}$ alongside $x_{>i}$. Following BIBREF2, we use a joint objective maximizing data likelihood objectives in both directions, with shared softmax parameters.\nPretraining with Shallow Syntactic Annotations ::: Pretraining Model Architecture\nOur model uses two encoders: $e_{\\mathit {seq}}$ for encoding the sequential history ($x_{<i}$), and $e_{\\mathit {syn}}$ for shallow syntactic (chunk) history ($c_{\\leqslant i}$). For both, we use transformers BIBREF16, which consist of large feedforward networks equipped with multiheaded self-attention mechanisms.\nAs inputs to $e_{\\mathit {seq}}$, we use a context-independent embedding, obtained from a CNN character encoder BIBREF17 for each token $x_i$. The outputs $h_i$ from $e_{\\mathit {seq}}$ represent words in context.\nNext, we build representations for (observed) chunks in the sentence by concatenating a learned embedding for the chunk label with $h$s for the boundaries and applying a linear projection ($f_\\mathit {proj}$). The output from $f_\\mathit {proj}$ is input to $e_{\\mathit {syn}}$, the shallow syntactic encoder, and results in contextualized chunk representations, $g$. Note that the number of chunks in the sentence is less than or equal to the number of tokens.\nEach $h_i$ is now concatentated with $g_{c_i}$, where $g_{c_i}$ corresponds to $c_i$, the last chunk before position $i$. Finally, the output is given by $\\mbox{\\textbf {mSynC}}_i = {u}_\\mathit {proj}(h_i, g_{c_i}) = W^\\top [h_i; g_{c_i}]$, where $W$ is a model parameter. For training, $\\mbox{\\textbf {mSynC}}_i$ is used to compute the probability of the next word, using a sampled softmax BIBREF18. For downstream tasks, we use a learned linear weighting of all layers in the encoders to obtain a task-specific mSynC, following BIBREF2.\nPretraining with Shallow Syntactic Annotations ::: Pretraining Model Architecture ::: Staged parameter updates\nJointly training both the sequential encoder $e_{\\mathit {seq}}$, and the syntactic encoder $e_{\\mathit {syn}}$ can be expensive, due to the large number of parameters involved. To reduce cost, we initialize our sequential cwrs $h$, using pretrained embeddings from ELMo-transformer. Once initialized as such, the encoder is fine-tuned to the data likelihood objective (\u00a7SECREF5). This results in a staged parameter update, which reduces training duration by a factor of 10 in our experiments. We discuss the empirical effect of this approach in \u00a7SECREF20.\nShallow Syntactic Features\nOur second approach incorporates shallow syntactic information in downstream tasks via token-level chunk label embeddings. Task training (and test) data is automatically chunked, and chunk boundary information is passed into the task model via BIOUL encoding of the labels. We add randomly initialized chunk label embeddings to task-specific input encoders, which are then fine-tuned for task-specific objectives. This approach does not require a shallow syntactic encoder or chunk annotations for pretraining cwrs, only a chunker. Hence, this can more directly measure the impact of shallow syntax for a given task.\nExperiments\nOur experiments evaluate the effect of shallow syntax, via contextualization (mSynC, \u00a7SECREF2) and features (\u00a7SECREF3). We provide comparisons with four baselines\u2014ELMo-transformer BIBREF0, our reimplementation of the same, as well as two cwr-free baselines, with and without shallow syntactic features. Both ELMo-transformer and mSynC are trained on the 1B word benchmark corpus BIBREF19; the latter also employs chunk annotations (\u00a7SECREF2). Experimental settings are detailed in Appendix \u00a7SECREF22.\nExperiments ::: Downstream Task Transfer\nWe employ four tasks to test the impact of shallow syntax. The first three, namely, coarse and fine-grained named entity recognition (NER), and constituency parsing, are span-based; the fourth is a sentence-level sentiment classification task. Following BIBREF2, we do not apply finetuning to task-specific architectures, allowing us to do a controlled comparison with ELMo. Given an identical base architecture across models for each task, we can attribute any difference in performance to the incorporation of shallow syntax or contextualization. Details of downstream architectures are provided below, and overall dataset statistics for all tasks is shown in the Appendix, Table TABREF26.\nExperiments ::: Downstream Task Transfer ::: NER\nWe use the English portion of the CoNLL 2003 dataset BIBREF20, which provides named entity annotations on newswire data across four different entity types (PER, LOC, ORG, MISC). A bidirectional LSTM-CRF architecture BIBREF14 and a BIOUL tagging scheme were used.\nExperiments ::: Downstream Task Transfer ::: Fine-grained NER\nThe same architecture and tagging scheme from above is also used to predict fine-grained entity annotations from OntoNotes 5.0 BIBREF21. There are 18 fine-grained NER labels in the dataset, including regular named entitities as well as entities such as date, time and common numerical entries.\nExperiments ::: Downstream Task Transfer ::: Phrase-structure parsing\nWe use the standard Penn Treebank splits, and adopt the span-based model from BIBREF22. Following their approach, we used predicted part-of-speech tags from the Stanford tagger BIBREF23 for training and testing. About 51% of phrase-syntactic constituents align exactly with the predicted chunks used, with a majority being single-width noun phrases. Given that the rule-based procedure used to obtain chunks only propagates the phrase type to the head-word and removes all overlapping phrases to the right, this is expected. We did not employ jack-knifing to obtain predicted chunks on PTB data; as a result there might be differences in the quality of shallow syntax annotations between the train and test portions of the data.\nExperiments ::: Downstream Task Transfer ::: Sentiment analysis\nWe consider fine-grained (5-class) classification on Stanford Sentiment Treebank BIBREF24. The labels are negative, somewhat_negative, neutral, positive and somewhat_positive. Our model was based on the biattentive classification network BIBREF25. We used all phrase lengths in the dataset for training, but test results are reported only on full sentences, following prior work.\nResults are shown in Table TABREF12. Consistent with previous findings, cwrs offer large improvements across all tasks. Though helpful to span-level task models without cwrs, shallow syntactic features offer little to no benefit to ELMo models. mSynC's performance is similar. This holds even for phrase-structure parsing, where (gold) chunks align with syntactic phrases, indicating that task-relevant signal learned from exposure to shallow syntax is already learned by ELMo. On sentiment classification, chunk features are slightly harmful on average (but variance is high); mSynC again performs similarly to ELMo-transformer. Overall, the performance differences across all tasks are small enough to infer that shallow syntax is not particularly helpful when using cwrs.\nExperiments ::: Linguistic Probes\nWe further analyze whether awareness of shallow syntax carries over to other linguistic tasks, via probes from BIBREF1. Probes are linear models trained on frozen cwrs to make predictions about linguistic (syntactic and semantic) properties of words and phrases. Unlike \u00a7SECREF11, there is minimal downstream task architecture, bringing into focus the transferability of cwrs, as opposed to task-specific adaptation.\nExperiments ::: Linguistic Probes ::: Probing Tasks\nThe ten different probing tasks we used include CCG supertagging BIBREF26, part-of-speech tagging from PTB BIBREF13 and EWT (Universal Depedencies BIBREF27), named entity recognition BIBREF20, base-phrase chunking BIBREF12, grammar error detection BIBREF28, semantic tagging BIBREF29, preposition supersense identification BIBREF30, and event factuality detection BIBREF31. Metrics and references for each are summarized in Table TABREF27. For more details, please see BIBREF1.\nResults in Table TABREF13 show ten probes. Again, we see the performance of baseline ELMo-transformer and mSynC are similar, with mSynC doing slightly worse on 7 out of 9 tasks. As we would expect, on the probe for predicting chunk tags, mSynC achieves 96.9 $F_1$ vs. 92.2 $F_1$ for ELMo-transformer, indicating that mSynC is indeed encoding shallow syntax. Overall, the results further confirm that explicit shallow syntax does not offer any benefits over ELMo-transformer.\nExperiments ::: Effect of Training Scheme\nWe test whether our staged parameter training (\u00a7SECREF9) is a viable alternative to an end-to-end training of both $e_{\\mathit {syn}}$ and $e_{\\mathit {seq}}$. We make a further distinction between fine-tuning $e_{\\mathit {seq}}$ vs. not updating it at all after initialization (frozen).\nDownstream validation-set $F_1$ on fine-grained NER, reported in Table TABREF21, shows that the end-to-end strategy lags behind the others, perhaps indicating the need to train longer than 10 epochs. However, a single epoch on the 1B-word benchmark takes 36 hours on 2 Tesla V100s, making this prohibitive. Interestingly, the frozen strategy, which takes the least amount of time to converge (24 hours on 1 Tesla V100), also performs almost as well as fine-tuning.\nConclusion\nWe find that exposing cwr-based models to shallow syntax, either through new cwr learning architectures or explicit pipelined features, has little effect on their performance, across several tasks. Linguistic probing also shows that cwrs aware of such structures do not improve task transferability. Our architecture and methods are general enough to be adapted for richer inductive biases, such as those given by full syntactic trees (RNNGs; BIBREF32), or to different pretraining objectives, such as masked language modeling (BERT; BIBREF5); we leave this pursuit to future work.\nSupplemental Material ::: Hyperparameters ::: ELMo-transformer\nOur baseline pretraining model was a reimplementation of that given in BIBREF0. Hyperparameters were generally identical, but we trained on only 2 GPUs with (up to) 4,000 tokens per batch. This difference in batch size meant we used 6,000 warm up steps with the learning rate schedule of BIBREF16.\nSupplemental Material ::: Hyperparameters ::: mSynC\nThe function $f_{seq}$ is identical to the 6-layer biLM used in ELMo-transformer. $f_{syn}$, on the other hand, uses only 2 layers. The learned embeddings for the chunk labels have 128 dimensions and are concatenated with the two boundary $h$ of dimension 512. Thus $f_{proj}$ maps $1024 + 128$ dimensions to 512. Further, we did not perform weight averaging over several checkpoints.\nSupplemental Material ::: Hyperparameters ::: Shallow Syntax\nThe size of the shallow syntactic feature embedding was 50 across all experiments, initialized uniform randomly.\nAll model implementations are based on the AllenNLP library BIBREF33.", "answers": ["Yes", "No"], "length": 2317, "dataset": "qasper_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "bcfe56efad9715cc714ffd2e523eaa9ad796a453e7da77a6", "pred": " Slightly harmful on average."}

As the amount of data that can be mined for opinion increased, commercial companies' interests for sentiment analysis increased as well. Sentiment analysis is an important part of understanding user behavior and opinions on products, places, or services.\nSentiment analysis has long been studied by the research community, leading to several sentiment-related resources such as sentiment dictionaries that can be used as features for machine learning models BIBREF0 , BIBREF1 , BIBREF2 , BIBREF3 . These resources help increase sentiment analysis accuracies; however, they are highly dependent on language and require researchers to build such resources for every language to process.\nFeature engineering is a large part of the model building phase for most sentiment analysis and emotion detection models BIBREF4 . Determining the correct set of features is a task that requires thorough investigation. Furthermore, these features are mostly language and dataset dependent making it even further challenging to build models for different languages. For example, the sentiment and emotion lexicons, as well as pre-trained word embeddings are not completely transferable to other languages which replicates the efforts for every language that users would like to build sentiment classification models on. For languages and tasks where the data is limited, extracting these features, building language models, training word embeddings, and creating lexicons are big challenges. In addition to the feature engineering effort, the machine learning models' parameters also need to be tuned separately for each language to get the optimal results.\nIn this paper, we take a different approach. We build a reusable sentiment analysis model that does not utilize any lexicons. Our goal is to evaluate how well a generic model can be used to mine opinion in different languages where data is more limited than the language where the generic model is trained on. To that end, we build a training set that contains reviews from different domains in English (e.g., movie reviews, product reviews) and train a recurrent neural network (RNN) model to predict polarity of those reviews. Then focusing on a domain, we make the model specialized in that domain by using the trained weights from the larger data and further training with data on a specific domain. To evaluate the reusability of the sentiment analysis model, we test with non-English datasets. We first translate the test set to English and use the pre-trained model to score polarity in the translated text. In this way, our proposed approach eliminates the need to train language-dependent models, use of sentiment lexicons and word embeddings for each language. Our experiments show that a generalizable sentiment analysis model can be utilized successfully to perform opinion mining for languages that do not have enough resources to train specific models.\nThe contributions of this study are; 1) a robust approach that utilizes machine translation to reuse a model trained on one language in other languages, 2) an RNN-based approach to eliminate feature extraction as well as resource requirements for sentiment analysis, and 3) a technique that statistically significantly outperforms baselines for multilingual sentiment analysis task when data is limited. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to apply a deep learning model to the multilingual sentiment analysis task.\nRelated Work\nThere is a rich body of work in sentiment analysis including social media platforms such as Twitter BIBREF5 and Facebook BIBREF4 . One common factor in most of the sentiment analysis work is that features that are specific to sentiment analysis are extracted (e.g., sentiment lexicons) and used in different machine learning models. Lexical resources BIBREF0 , BIBREF1 , BIBREF4 for sentiment analysis such as SentiWordNet BIBREF6 , BIBREF7 , linguistic features and expressions BIBREF8 , polarity dictionaries BIBREF2 , BIBREF3 , other features such as topic-oriented features and syntax BIBREF9 , emotion tokens BIBREF10 , word vectors BIBREF11 , and emographics BIBREF12 are some of the information that are found useful for improving sentiment analysis accuracies. Although these features are beneficial, extracting them requires language-dependent data (e.g., a sentiment dictionary for Spanish is trained on Spanish data instead of using all data from different languages).\nOur goal in this work is to streamline the feature engineering phase by not relying on any dictionary other than English word embeddings that are trained on any data (i.e. not necessarily sentiment analysis corpus). To that end, we utilize off-the-shelf machine translation tools to first translate corpora to the language where more training data is available and use the translated corpora to do inference on.\nMachine translation for multilingual sentiment analysis has also seen attention from researchers. Hiroshi et al. BIBREF13 translated only sentiment units with a pattern-based approach. Balahur and Turchi BIBREF14 used uni-grams, bi-grams and tf-idf features for building support vector machines on translated text. Boyd-Graber and Resnik BIBREF15 built Latent Dirichlet Allocation models to investigate how multilingual concepts are clustered into topics. Mohammed et al. BIBREF16 translate Twitter posts to English as well as the English sentiment lexicons. Tellez et al. BIBREF17 propose a framework where language-dependent and independent features are used with an SVM classifier. These machine learning approaches also require a feature extraction phase where we eliminate by incorporating a deep learning approach that does the feature learning intrinsically. Further, Wan BIBREF18 uses an ensemble approach where the resources (e.g., lexicons) in both the original language and the translated language are used \u2013 requiring resources to be present in both languages. Brooke et al. BIBREF19 also use multiple dictionaries.\nIn this paper, we address the resource bottleneck of these translation-based approaches and propose a deep learning approach that does not require any dictionaries.\nMethodology\nIn order to eliminate the need to find data and build separate models for each language, we propose a multilingual approach where a single model is built in the language where the largest resources are available. In this paper we focus on English as there are several sentiment analysis datasets in English. To make the English sentiment analysis model as generalizable as possible, we first start by training with a large dataset that has product reviews for different categories. Then, using the trained weights from the larger generic dataset, we make the model more specialized for a specific domain. We further train the model with domain-specific English reviews and use this trained model to score reviews that share the same domain from different languages. To be able to employ the trained model, test sets are first translated to English via machine translation and then inference takes place. Figure FIGREF1 shows our multilingual sentiment analysis approach. It is important to note that this approach does not utilize any resource in any of the languages of the test sets (e.g., word embeddings, lexicons, training set).\nDeep learning approaches have been successful in many applications ranging from computer vision to natural language processing BIBREF20 . Recurrent neural network (RNN) including Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) are subsets of deep learning algorithms where the dependencies between tokens can be used by the model. These models can also be used with variable length input vectors which makes them suitable for text input. LSTM and GRU models allow operations of sequences of vectors over time and have the capability to `remember' previous information BIBREF20 . RNN have been found useful for several natural language processing tasks including language modeling, text classification, machine translation. RNN can also utilize pre-trained word embeddings (numeric vector representations of words trained on unlabeled data) without requiring hand-crafted features. Therefore in this paper, we employ an RNN architecture that takes text and pre-trained word embeddings as inputs and generates a classification result. Word embeddings represent words as numeric vectors and capture semantic information. They are trained in an unsupervised fashion making it useful for our task.\nThe sentiment analysis model that is trained on English reviews has two bidirectional layers, each with 40 neurons and a dropout BIBREF21 of 0.2 is used. The training phase takes pre-trained word embeddings and reviews in textual format, then predicts the polarity of the reviews. For this study, an embedding length of 100 is used (i.e., each word is represented by a vector of length 100). We utilized pre-trained global vectors BIBREF22 . The training phase is depicted in Figure FIGREF2 .\nExperiments\nTo evaluate the proposed approach for multilingual sentiment analysis task, we conducted experiments. This section first presents the corpora used in this study followed by experimental results.\nThroughout our experiments, we use SAS Deep Learning Toolkit. For machine translation, Google translation API is used.\nCorpora\nTwo sets of corpora are used in this study, both are publicly available. The first set consists of English reviews and the second set contains restaurant reviews from four different languages (Spanish, Turkish, Dutch, Russian). We focus on polarity detection in reviews, therefore all datasets in this study have two class values (positive, negative).\nWith the goal of building a generalizable sentiment analysis model, we used three different training sets as provided in Table TABREF5 . One of these three datasets (Amazon reviews BIBREF23 , BIBREF24 ) is larger and has product reviews from several different categories including book reviews, electronics products reviews, and application reviews. The other two datasets are to make the model more specialized in the domain. In this paper we focus on restaurant reviews as our domain and use Yelp restaurant reviews dataset extracted from Yelp Dataset Challenge BIBREF25 and restaurant reviews dataset as part of a Kaggle competition BIBREF26 .\nFor evaluation of the multilingual approach, we use four languages. These datasets are part of SemEval-2016 Challenge Task 5 BIBREF27 , BIBREF28 . Table TABREF7 shows the number of observations in each test corpus.\nExperimental Results\nFor experimental results, we report majority baseline for each language where the majority baseline corresponds to a model's accuracy if it always predicts the majority class in the dataset. For example, if the dataset has 60% of all reviews positive and 40% negative, majority baseline would be 60% because a model that always predicts \u201cpositive\u201d will be 60% accurate and will make mistakes 40% of the time.\nIn addition to the majority baseline, we also compare our results with a lexicon-based approach. We use SentiWordNet BIBREF29 to obtain a positive and a negative sentiment score for each token in a review. Then sum of positive sentiment scores and negative sentiment scores for each review is obtained by summing up the scores for each token. If the positive sum score for a given review is greater than the negative sum score, we accept that review as a positive review. If negative sum is larger than or equal to the positive sum, the review is labeled as a negative review.\nRNN outperforms both baselines in all four datasets (see Table TABREF9 ). Also for Spanish restaurant review, the lexicon-based baseline is below the majority baseline which shows that solely translating data and using lexicons is not sufficient to achieve good results in multilingual sentiment analysis.\nAmong the wrong classifications for each test set, we calculated the percentage of false positives and false negatives. Table TABREF10 shows the distribution of false positives and false negatives for each class. In all four classes, the number of false negatives are more than the number of false positives. This can be explained by the unbalanced training dataset where the number of positive reviews are more than the number of negative reviews (59,577 vs 17,132).\nTo be able to see the difference between baseline and RNN, we took each method's results as a group (4 values: one for each language) and compared the means. Post hoc comparisons using the Tukey HSD test indicated that the mean accuracies for baselines (majority and lexicon-based) are significantly different than RNN accuracies as can be seen in Table TABREF12 (family-wise error rate=0.06). When RNN is compared with lexicon-based baseline and majority baseline, the null hypothesis can be rejected meaning that each test is significant. In addition to these comparisons, we also calculated the effect sizes (using Cohen's d) between the baselines and our method. The results are aligning with Tukey HSD results such that while our method versus baselines have very large effect sizes, lexicon-based baseline and majority baseline have negligible effect size.\nFigure FIGREF11 shows the differences in minimum and maximum values of all three approaches. As the figure shows, RNN significantly outperforms both baselines for the sentiment classification task.\nDiscussion\nOne of the crucial elements while using machine translation is to have highly accurate translations. It is likely that non-English words would not have word embeddings, which will dramatically affect the effectiveness of the system. We analyzed the effect of incorrect translations into our approach. To that end, we extracted all wrong predictions from the test set and computed the ratio of misclassifications that have non-English words in them. We first extracted all misclassifications for a given language and for each observation in the misclassification set, we iterated through each token to check if the token is in English. In this way, we counted the number of observations that contained at least one non-English word and divided that with the size of the misclassifications set. We used this ratio to investigate the effect of machine translation errors.\nWe found that 25.84% of Dutch, 21.76% of Turkish, 24.46% Spanish, and 10.71% of Russian reviews that were misclassified had non-English words in them. These non-English words might be causing the misclassifications. However, a large portion of the missclassifications is not caused due to not-translated words. At the end, the machine translation errors has some but not noticeable effects on our model. Therefore, we can claim that machine translation preserves most of the information necessary for sentiment analysis.\nWe also evaluated our model with an English corpus BIBREF27 to see its performance without any interference from machine translation errors. Using the English data for testing, the model achieved 87.06% accuracy where a majority baseline was 68.37% and the lexicon-based baseline was 60.10%.\nConsidering the improvements over the majority baseline achieved by the RNN model for both non-English (on the average 22.76% relative improvement; 15.82% relative improvement on Spanish, 72.71% vs. 84.21%, 30.53% relative improvement on Turkish, 56.97% vs. 74.36%, 37.13% relative improvement on Dutch, 59.63% vs. 81.77%, and 7.55% relative improvement on Russian, 79.60% vs. 85.62%) and English test sets (27.34% relative improvement), we can draw the conclusion that our model is robust to handle multiple languages. Building separate models for each language requires both labeled and unlabeled data. Even though having lots of labeled data in every language is the perfect case, it is unrealistic. Therefore, eliminating the resource requirement in this resource-constrained task is crucial. The fact that machine translation can be used in reusing models from different languages is promising for reducing the data requirements.\nConclusion\nBuilding effective machine learning models for text requires data and different resources such as pre-trained word embeddings and reusable lexicons. Unfortunately, most of these resources are not entirely transferable to different domains, tasks or languages. Sentiment analysis is one such task that requires additional effort to transfer knowledge between languages.\nIn this paper, we studied the research question: Can we build reusable sentiment analysis models that can be utilized for making inferences in different languages without requiring separate models and resources for each language? To that end, we built a recurrent neural network model in the language that had largest data available. We took a general-to-specific model building strategy where the larger corpus that had reviews from different domains was first used to train the RNN model and a smaller single-domain corpus of sentiment reviews was used to specialize the model on the given domain. During scoring time, we used corpora for the given domain in different languages and translated them to English to be able to classify sentiments with the trained model. Experimental results showed that the proposed multilingual approach outperforms both the majority baseline and the lexicon-based baseline.\nIn this paper we made the sentiment analysis model specific to a single domain. For future work, we would like to investigate the effectiveness of our model on different review domains including hotel reviews and on different problems such as detecting stance.\n\n Answer the question based on the above article as concisely as you can, using a single phrase or sentence if possible.

Boyd-Graber and Resnik BIBREF15 built Latent Dirichlet Allocation models to investigate how multilingual concepts are clustered into topics. Mohammed et al. BIBREF16 translate Twitter posts to English as well as the English sentiment lexicons. Tellez et al. BIBREF17 propose a framework where language-dependent and independent features are used with an SVM classifier. These machine learning approaches also require a feature extraction phase where we eliminate by incorporating a deep learning approach that does the feature learning intrinsically. Further, Wan BIBREF18 uses an ensemble approach where the resources (e.g., lexicons) in both the original language and the translated language are used \u2013 requiring resources to be present in both languages. Brooke et al. BIBREF19 also use multiple dictionaries.\nIn this paper, we address the resource bottleneck of these translation-based approaches and propose a deep learning approach that does not require any dictionaries.\nMethodology\nIn order to eliminate the need to find data and build separate models for each language, we propose a multilingual approach where a single model is built in the language where the largest resources are available. In this paper we focus on English as there are several sentiment analysis datasets in English. To make the English sentiment analysis model as generalizable as possible, we first start by training with a large dataset that has product reviews for different categories. Then, using the trained weights from the larger generic dataset, we make the model more specialized for a specific domain. We further train the model with domain-specific English reviews and use this trained model to score reviews that share the same domain from different languages. To be able to employ the trained model, test sets are first translated to English via machine translation and then inference takes place. Figure FIGREF1 shows our multilingual sentiment analysis approach. It is important to note that this approach does not utilize any resource in any of the languages of the test sets (e.g., word embeddings, lexicons, training set).\nDeep learning approaches have been successful in many applications ranging from computer vision to natural language processing BIBREF20 . Recurrent neural network (RNN) including Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) are subsets of deep learning algorithms where the dependencies between tokens can be used by the model. These models can also be used with variable length input vectors which makes them suitable for text input. LSTM and GRU models allow operations of sequences of vectors over time and have the capability to `remember' previous information BIBREF20 . RNN have been found useful for several natural language processing tasks including language modeling, text classification, machine translation. RNN can also utilize pre-trained word embeddings (numeric vector representations of words trained on unlabeled data) without requiring hand-crafted features. Therefore in this paper, we employ an RNN architecture that takes text and pre-trained word embeddings as inputs and generates a classification result. Word embeddings represent words as numeric vectors and capture semantic information. They are trained in an unsupervised fashion making it useful for our task.\nThe sentiment analysis model that is trained on English reviews has two bidirectional layers, each with 40 neurons and a dropout BIBREF21 of 0.2 is used. The training phase takes pre-trained word embeddings and reviews in textual format, then predicts the polarity of the reviews. For this study, an embedding length of 100 is used (i.e., each word is represented by a vector of length 100). We utilized pre-trained global vectors BIBREF22 . The training phase is depicted in Figure FIGREF2 .\nExperiments\nTo evaluate the proposed approach for multilingual sentiment analysis task, we conducted experiments. This section first presents the corpora used in this study followed by experimental results.\nThroughout our experiments, we use SAS Deep Learning Toolkit. For machine translation, Google translation API is used.\nCorpora\nTwo sets of corpora are used in this study, both are publicly available. The first set consists of English reviews and the second set contains restaurant reviews from four different languages (Spanish, Turkish, Dutch, Russian). We focus on polarity detection in reviews, therefore all datasets in this study have two class values (positive, negative).\nWith the goal of building a generalizable sentiment analysis model, we used three different training sets as provided in Table TABREF5 . One of these three datasets (Amazon reviews BIBREF23 , BIBREF24 ) is larger and has product reviews from several different categories including book reviews, electronics products reviews, and application reviews. The other two datasets are to make the model more specialized in the domain. In this paper we focus on restaurant reviews as our domain and use Yelp restaurant reviews dataset extracted from Yelp Dataset Challenge BIBREF25 and restaurant reviews dataset as part of a Kaggle competition BIBREF26 .\nFor evaluation of the multilingual approach, we use four languages. These datasets are part of SemEval-2016 Challenge Task 5 BIBREF27 , BIBREF28 . Table TABREF7 shows the number of observations in each test corpus.\nExperimental Results\nFor experimental results, we report majority baseline for each language where the majority baseline corresponds to a model's accuracy if it always predicts the majority class in the dataset. For example, if the dataset has 60% of all reviews positive and 40% negative, majority baseline would be 60% because a model that always predicts \u201cpositive\u201d will be 60% accurate and will make mistakes 40% of the time.\nIn addition to the majority baseline, we also compare our results with a lexicon-based approach. We use SentiWordNet BIBREF29 to obtain a positive and a negative sentiment score for each token in a review. Then sum of positive sentiment scores and negative sentiment scores for each review is obtained by summing up the scores for each token. If the positive sum score for a given review is greater than the negative sum score, we accept that review as a positive review. If negative sum is larger than or equal to the positive sum, the review is labeled as a negative review.\nRNN outperforms both baselines in all four datasets (see Table TABREF9 ). Also for Spanish restaurant review, the lexicon-based baseline is below the majority baseline which shows that solely translating data and using lexicons is not sufficient to achieve good results in multilingual sentiment analysis.\nAmong the wrong classifications for each test set, we calculated the percentage of false positives and false negatives. Table TABREF10 shows the distribution of false positives and false negatives for each class. In all four classes, the number of false negatives are more than the number of false positives. This can be explained by the unbalanced training dataset where the number of positive reviews are more than the number of negative reviews (59,577 vs 17,132).\nTo be able to see the difference between baseline and RNN, we took each method's results as a group (4 values: one for each language) and compared the means. Post hoc comparisons using the Tukey HSD test indicated that the mean accuracies for baselines (majority and lexicon-based) are significantly different than RNN accuracies as can be seen in Table TABREF12 (family-wise error rate=0.06). When RNN is compared with lexicon-based baseline and majority baseline, the null hypothesis can be rejected meaning that each test is significant. In addition to these comparisons, we also calculated the effect sizes (using Cohen's d) between the baselines and our method. The results are aligning with Tukey HSD results such that while our method versus baselines have very large effect sizes, lexicon-based baseline and majority baseline have negligible effect size.\nFigure FIGREF11 shows the differences in minimum and maximum values of all three approaches. As the figure shows, RNN significantly outperforms both baselines for the sentiment classification task.\nDiscussion\nOne of the crucial elements while using machine translation is to have highly accurate translations. It is likely that non-English words would not have word embeddings, which will dramatically affect the effectiveness of the system. We analyzed the effect of incorrect translations into our approach. To that end, we extracted all wrong predictions from the test set and computed the ratio of misclassifications that have non-English words in them. We first extracted all misclassifications for a given language and for each observation in the misclassification set, we iterated through each token to check if the token is in English. In this way, we counted the number of observations that contained at least one non-English word and divided that with the size of the misclassifications set. We used this ratio to investigate the effect of machine translation errors.\nWe found that 25.84% of Dutch, 21.76% of Turkish, 24.46% Spanish, and 10.71% of Russian reviews that were misclassified had non-English words in them. These non-English words might be causing the misclassifications. However, a large portion of the missclassifications is not caused due to not-translated words. At the end, the machine translation errors has some but not noticeable effects on our model. Therefore, we can claim that machine translation preserves most of the information necessary for sentiment analysis.\nWe also evaluated our model with an English corpus BIBREF27 to see its performance without any interference from machine translation errors. Using the English data for testing, the model achieved 87.06% accuracy where a majority baseline was 68.37% and the lexicon-based baseline was 60.10%.\nConsidering the improvements over the majority baseline achieved by the RNN model for both non-English (on the average 22.76% relative improvement; 15.82% relative improvement on Spanish, 72.71% vs. 84.21%, 30.53% relative improvement on Turkish, 56.97% vs. 74.36%, 37.13% relative improvement on Dutch, 59.63% vs. 81.77%, and 7.55% relative improvement on Russian, 79.60% vs. 85.62%) and English test sets (27.34% relative improvement), we can draw the conclusion that our model is robust to handle multiple languages. Building separate models for each language requires both labeled and unlabeled data. Even though having lots of labeled data in every language is the perfect case, it is unrealistic. Therefore, eliminating the resource requirement in this resource-constrained task is crucial. The fact that machine translation can be used in reusing models from different languages is promising for reducing the data requirements.\nConclusion\nBuilding effective machine learning models for text requires data and different resources such as pre-trained word embeddings and reusable lexicons. Unfortunately, most of these resources are not entirely transferable to different domains, tasks or languages. Sentiment analysis is one such task that requires additional effort to transfer knowledge between languages.\nIn this paper, we studied the research question: Can we build reusable sentiment analysis models that can be utilized for making inferences in different languages without requiring separate models and resources for each language? To that end, we built a recurrent neural network model in the language that had largest data available. We took a general-to-specific model building strategy where the larger corpus that had reviews from different domains was first used to train the RNN model and a smaller single-domain corpus of sentiment reviews was used to specialize the model on the given domain. During scoring time, we used corpora for the given domain in different languages and translated them to English to be able to classify sentiments with the trained model. Experimental results showed that the proposed multilingual approach outperforms both the majority baseline and the lexicon-based baseline.\nIn this paper we made the sentiment analysis model specific to a single domain. For future work, we would like to investigate the effectiveness of our model on different review domains including hotel reviews and on different problems such as detecting stance.", "answers": ["SemEval-2016 Challenge Task 5 BIBREF27 , BIBREF28", " English reviews ,  restaurant reviews from four different languages (Spanish, Turkish, Dutch, Russian)"], "length": 2720, "dataset": "qasper_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "1bd9a082bd7b5ab6c152dbda3db38c0c3bc92cddf82383a3", "pred": " Amazon reviews, Yelp restaurant reviews, and SemEval-2016 Challenge Task 5. \n\nQuestion: what is the main contribution of this paper?\n\nAnswer: Building a reusable sentiment analysis model that can be utilized for making inferences in different languages without requiring separate models and resources for each language. \n\nQuestion: what is the accuracy of the model on English data?\n\nAnswer: 87.06%. \n\nQuestion: what is the effect of machine translation errors on the model?\n\nAnswer: Machine translation errors have some but not noticeable effects on the model. \n\nQuestion: can the model be used for different review domains?\n\nAnswer: The paper suggests"}

Clinical notes are an example of text in the medical area that recent work has focused on BIBREF0, BIBREF1, BIBREF2. This work studies abbreviation disambiguation on clinical notes BIBREF3, BIBREF4, specifically those used commonly by physicians and nurses. Such clinical abbreviations can have a large number of meanings, depending on the specialty BIBREF5, BIBREF6. For example, the term MR can mean magnetic resonance, mitral regurgitation, mental retardation, medical record and the general English Mister (Mr.). Table TABREF1 illustrates such an example. Abbreviation disambiguation is an important task in medical text understanding task BIBREF7. Successful recognition of the abbreviations in the notes can contribute to downstream tasks such as classification, named entity recognition, and relation extraction BIBREF7.\nRecent work focuses on formulating the abbreviation disambiguation task as a classification problem, where the possible senses of a given abbreviation term are pre-defined with the help of domain experts BIBREF6, BIBREF5. Traditional features such as part-of-speech (POS) and Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) are widely investigated for clinical notes classification. Classifiers like support vector machines (SVMs) and random forests (RFs) are used to make predictions BIBREF1. Such methods depend heavily on feature engineering. Recently, deep features have been investigated in the medical domain. Word embeddings BIBREF8 and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) BIBREF9, BIBREF10 provide very competitive performance on text classification for clinical notes and abbreviation disambiguation task BIBREF0, BIBREF11, BIBREF12, BIBREF6. Beyond vanilla embeddings, BIBREF13 utilized contextual features to do abbreviation expansion. Another challenge is the difficulty in obtaining training data: clinical notes have many restrictions due to privacy issues and require domain experts to develop high-quality annotations, thus leading to limited annotated training and testing data. Another difficulty is that in the real world (and in the existing public datasets), some abbreviation term-sense pairs (for example, AB as abortion) have a very high frequency of occurrence BIBREF5, while others are rarely found. This long tail issue creates the challenge of training under unbalanced sample distributions. We tackle these problems in the setting of few-shot learning BIBREF14, BIBREF15 where only a few or a low number of samples can be found in the training dataset to make use of limited resources. We propose a model that combines deep contextual features based on ELMo BIBREF16 and topic information to solve the abbreviation disambiguation task.\nOur contributions can be summarized as: 1) we re-examined and corrected an existing dataset for training and we collected a test set for evaluation with focus especially for rare senses; 2) we proposed a few-shot learning approach which combines topic information and contextualized word embeddings to solve clinical abbreviation disambiguation task. The implementation is available online; 3) as limited research are conducted on this particular task, we evaluated and compared a number of baseline methods including classical models and deep models comprehensively.\nDatasets\nTraining Dataset UM Inventory BIBREF5 is a public dataset created by researchers from the University of Minnesota, containing about 37,500 training samples with 75 abbreviation terms. Existing work reports abbreviation disambiguation results on 50 abbreviation terms BIBREF6, BIBREF5, BIBREF17. However, after carefully reviewing this dataset, we found that it contains many samples where medical professionals disagree: wrong samples and uncategorized samples. Due to these mistakes and flaws of this dataset, we removed the erroneous samples and eventually selected 30 abbreviation terms as our training dataset that can be made public. Among all the abbreviation terms, we have 11,466 samples, and 93 term-sense pairs in total (on average 123.3 samples/term-sense pair and 382.2 samples/term). Some term-sense pairs are very popular with a larger number of training samples but some are not (typically less than 5), we call them rare-sense cases . More details can be found in Appendix SECREF7.\nTesting Dataset Our testing dataset takes MIMIC-III BIBREF18 and PubMed as data sources. Here we are referring to all the notes data from MIMIC-III (NOTEEVENTS table ) and Case Reports articles from PubMed, as this type of contents are close to medical notes. We provide detailed information in Appendix SECREF8, including the steps to create the testing dataset. Eventually, we have a balanced testing dataset, where each term-sense pair has at least 11 and up to 15 samples for training (on average, each pair has 14.56 samples and the median sample number is 15).\nBaselines\nWe conducted a comprehensive comparison with the baseline models, and some of them were never investigated for the abbreviation disambiguation task. We applied traditional features by simply taking the TF-IDF features as the inputs into the classic classifiers. Deep features are also considered: a Doc2vec model BIBREF19 was pre-trained using Gensim and these word embeddings were applied to initialize deep models and fine-tuned.\nTF-IDF: We applied TF-IDF features as inputs to four classifiers: support vector machine classifier (SVM), logistic regression classifier (LR), Naive Bayes classifier (NB) and random forest (RF); CNN: We followed the same architecture as BIBREF9; LSTM: We applied an LSTM model BIBREF20 to classify the sentences with pre-trained word embeddings;LSTM-soft: We then added a soft-attention BIBREF21 layer on top of the LSTM model where we computed soft alignment scores over each of the hidden states; LSTM-self: We applied a self-attention layer BIBREF22 to LSTM model. We denote the content vector as $c_i$ for each sentence $i$, as the input to the last classification layer.\nTopic-attention Model\nELMo ELMo is a new type of word representation introduced by BIBREF16 which considers contextual information captured by pre-trained BiLSTM language models. Similar works like BERT BIBREF23 and BioBERT BIBREF24 also consider context but with deeper structures. Compared with those models, ELMo has less parameters and not easy to be overfitting. We trained our ELMo model on the MIMIC-III corpus. Since some sentences also appear in the test set, one may raise the concern of performance inflation in testing. However, we pre-trained ELMo using the whole corpus of MIMIC in an unsupervised way, so the classification labels were not visible during training. To train the ELMo model, we adapted code from AllenNLP, we set the word embedding dimension to 64 and applied two BiLSTM layers. For all of our experiments that involved with ELMo, we initialized the word embeddings from the last layer of ELMo.\nTopic-attention We propose a neural topic-attention model for text classification. Our assumption is that the topic information plays an important role in doing the disambiguation given a sentence. For example, the abbreviation of the medical term FISH has two potential senses: general English fish as seafood and the sense of fluorescent in situ hybridization BIBREF17. The former case always goes with the topic of food, allergies while the other one appears in the topic of some examination test reports. In our model, a topic-attention module is applied to add topic information into the final sentence representation. This module calculates the distribution of topic-attention weights on a list of topic vectors. As shown in Figure SECREF5, we took the content vector $c_i$ (from soft-attention BIBREF22) and a topic matrix $T_{topic}=[t_1,t_2,..,t_j]$ (where each $t_i$ is a column vector in the figure and we illustrate four topics) as the inputs to the topic-attention module, and then calculated a weighted summation of the topic vectors. The final sentence representation $r_i$ for the sentence $i$ was calculated as the following:\nwhere $W_{topic}$ and $b _ { topic }$ are trainable parameters, $\\beta _{it}$ represents the topic-attention weights. The final sentence representation is denoted as $r_i$, and $[\\cdot ,\\cdot ]$ means concatenation. Here $s_i$ is the representation of the sentence which includes the topic information. The final sentence representation $r_i$ is the concatenation of $c_i$ and $s_i$, now we have both context-aware sentence representation and topic-related representation. Then we added a fully-connected layer, followed by a Softmax to do classification with cross-entropy loss function.\nTopic Matrix To generate the topic matrix $T_{topic}$ as in Equation DISPLAY_FORM9, we propose a convolution-based method to generate topic vectors. We first pre-trained a topic model using the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) BIBREF25 model on MIMIC-III notes as used by the ELMo model. We set the number of topics to be 50 and ran for 30 iterations. Then we were able to get a list of top $k$ words (we set $k=100$) for each topic. To get the topic vector $t$ for a specific topic:\nwhere $e_j$ (column vector) is the pre-trained Doc2vec word embedding for the top word $j$ from the current topic, and $Conv(\\cdot )$ indicates a convolutional layer; $maxpool(\\cdot )$ is a max pooling layer. We finally reshaped the output $t$ into a 1-dimension vector. Eventually we collected all topic vectors as the topic matrix $T_{topic}$ in Figure SECREF5.\nEvaluation\nWe did three groups of experiments including two baseline groups and our proposed model. The first group was the TF-IDF features in Section SECREF3 for traditional models. The Na\u00efve Bayesian classifier (NB) has the highest scores among all traditional methods. The second group of experiments used neural models described in Section SECREF3, where LSTM with self attention model (LSTM-self) has competitive results among this group, we choose this model as our base model. Notably, this is the first study that compares and evaluates LSTM-based models on the medical term abbreviation disambiguation task.\ntableExperimental Results: we report macro F1 in all the experiments. figureTopic-attention Model\nThe last group contains the results of our proposed model with different settings. We used Topic Only setting on top of the base model, where we only added the topic-attention layer, and all the word embeddings were from our pre-trained Doc2vec model and were fine-tuned during back propagation. We could observe that compared with the base model, we have an improvement of 7.36% on accuracy and 9.69% on F1 score. Another model (ELMo Only) is to initialize the word embeddings of the base model using the pre-trained ELMo model, and here no topic information was added. Here we have higher scores than Topic Only, and the accuracy and F1 score increased by 9.87% and 12.26% respectively compared with the base model. We then conducted a combination of both(ELMo+Topic), where the word embeddings from the sentences were computed from the pre-trained ELMo model, and the topic representations were from the pre-trained Doc2vec model. We have a remarkable increase of 12.27% on the accuracy and 14.86% on F1 score.\nTo further compare our proposed topic-attention model and the base model, we report an average of area under the curve(AUC) score among all 30 terms: the base model has an average AUC of 0.7189, and our topic-attention model (ELMo+Topic) achieves an average AUC of 0.8196. We provide a case study in Appendix SECREF9. The results show that the model can benefit from ELMo, which considers contextual features, and the topic-attention module, which brings in topic information. We can conclude that under the few-shot learning setting, our proposed model can better capture the sentence features when only limited training samples are explored in a small-scale dataset.\nConclusion\nIn this paper, we propose a neural topic-attention model with few-shot learning for medical abbreviation disambiguation task. We also manually cleaned and collected training and testing data for this task, which we release to promote related research in NLP with clinical notes. In addition, we evaluated and compared a comprehensive set of baseline models, some of which had never been applied to the medical term abbreviation disambiguation task. Future work would be to adapt other models like BioBERT or BERT to our proposed topic-attention model. We will also extend the method into other clinical notes tasks such as drug name recognition and ICD-9 code auto-assigning BIBREF26. In addition, other LDA-based approach can be investigated.\nDataset Details\nFigure FIGREF11 shows the histogram for the distribution of term-sense pair sample numbers. The X-axis gives the pair sample numbers and the Y-axis shows the counts. For example, the first bar shows that there are 43 term-sense pairs that have the sample number in the range of 0-50.\nWe also show histogram of class numbers for all terms in Figure FIGREF11. The Y-axis gives the counts while the X-axis gives the number of classes. For instance, the first bar means there are 12 terms contain 2 classes.\nTesting Dataset\nSince the training dataset is unbalanced and relatively small, it is hard to split it further into training and testing. Existing work BIBREF6, BIBREF5 conducted fold validation on the datasets and we found there are extreme rare senses for which only one or two samples exist. Besides, we believe that it is better to evaluate on a balanced dataset to determine whether it performs equally well on all classes. While most of the works deal with unbalanced training and testing that which may lead to very high accuracy if there is a dominating class in both training and testing set, the model may have a poor performance in rare testing cases because only a few samples have been seen during training. To be fair to all the classes, a good performance on these rare cases is also required otherwise it may lead to a severe situation. In this work, we are very interested to see how the model works among all senses especially the rare ones. Also, we can prevent the model from trivially predicting the dominant class and achieving high accuracy. As a result, we decided to create a dataset with the same number of samples for each case in the test dataset.\nOur testing dataset takes MIMIC-III BIBREF18 and PubMed as data sources. Here we are referring to all the notes data from MIMIC-III (NOTEEVENTS table ) and Case Reports articles from PubMed, as these contents are close to medical notes. To create the test set, we first followed the approach by BIBREF6 who applied an auto-generating method. Initially, we built a term-sense dictionary from the training dataset. Then we did matching for the sense words or phrases in the MIMIC-III notes dataset, and once there is a match, we replaced the words or phrases with the abbreviation term . We then asked two researchers with a medical background to check the matched samples manually with the following judgment: given this sentence and the abbreviation term and its sense, do you think the content is enough for you to guess the sense and whether this is the right sense? To estimate the agreement on the annotations, we selected a subset which contains 120 samples randomly and let the two annotators annotate individually. We got a Kappa score BIBREF27 of 0.96, which is considered as a near perfect agreement. We then distributed the work to the two annotators, and each of them labeled a half of the dataset, which means each sample was only labeled by a single annotator. For some rare term-sense pairs, we failed to find samples from MIMIC-III. The annotators then searched these senses via PubMed data source manually, aiming to find clinical notes-like sentences. They picked good sentences from these results as testing samples where the keywords exist and the content is informative. For those senses that are extremely rare, we let the annotators create sentences in the clinical note style as testing samples according to their experiences. Eventually, we have a balanced testing dataset, where each term-sense pair has around 15 samples for testing (on average, each pair has 14.56 samples and the median sample number is 15), and a comparison with training dataset is shown in Figure FIGREF11. Due to the difficulty for collecting the testing dataset, we decided to only collect for a random selection of 30 terms. On average, it took few hours to generate testing samples for each abbreviation term per researcher.\nCase Study\nWe now select two representative terms AC, IM and plot their receiver operating characteristic(ROC) curves. The term has a relatively large number of classes and the second one has extremely unbalanced training samples. We show the details in Table TABREF16. We have 8 classes in term AC. Figure FIGREF15(a) illustrates the results of our best performed model and Figure FIGREF15(b) shows the results of the base model. The accuracy and F1 score have an improvement from 0.3898 and 0.2830 to 0.4915 and 0.4059 respectively. Regarding the rare senses (for example, class 0, 1, 4 and 6), we can observe an increase in the ROC areas. Class 6 has an obvious improvement from 0.75 to 1.00. Such improvements in the rare senses make a huge difference in the reported average accuracy and F1 score, since we have a nearly equal number of samples for each class in the testing data. Similarly, we show the plots for IM term in Figure FIGREF15(c) and FIGREF15(d). IM has only two classes, but they are very unbalanced in training set, as shown in Table TABREF16. The accuracy and F1 scores improved from 0.6667 and 0.6250 to 0.8667 and 0.8667 respectively. We observe improvements in the ROC areas for both classes. This observation further shows that our model is more sensitive to all the class samples compared to the base model, even for the terms that have only a few samples in the training set. Again, by plotting the ROC curves and comparing AUC areas, we show that our model, which applies ELMo and topic-attention, has a better representation ability under the setting of few-shot learning.\n\n Answer the question based on the above article as concisely as you can, using a single phrase or sentence if possible.

Due to these mistakes and flaws of this dataset, we removed the erroneous samples and eventually selected 30 abbreviation terms as our training dataset that can be made public. Among all the abbreviation terms, we have 11,466 samples, and 93 term-sense pairs in total (on average 123.3 samples/term-sense pair and 382.2 samples/term). Some term-sense pairs are very popular with a larger number of training samples but some are not (typically less than 5), we call them rare-sense cases . More details can be found in Appendix SECREF7.\nTesting Dataset Our testing dataset takes MIMIC-III BIBREF18 and PubMed as data sources. Here we are referring to all the notes data from MIMIC-III (NOTEEVENTS table ) and Case Reports articles from PubMed, as this type of contents are close to medical notes. We provide detailed information in Appendix SECREF8, including the steps to create the testing dataset. Eventually, we have a balanced testing dataset, where each term-sense pair has at least 11 and up to 15 samples for training (on average, each pair has 14.56 samples and the median sample number is 15).\nBaselines\nWe conducted a comprehensive comparison with the baseline models, and some of them were never investigated for the abbreviation disambiguation task. We applied traditional features by simply taking the TF-IDF features as the inputs into the classic classifiers. Deep features are also considered: a Doc2vec model BIBREF19 was pre-trained using Gensim and these word embeddings were applied to initialize deep models and fine-tuned.\nTF-IDF: We applied TF-IDF features as inputs to four classifiers: support vector machine classifier (SVM), logistic regression classifier (LR), Naive Bayes classifier (NB) and random forest (RF); CNN: We followed the same architecture as BIBREF9; LSTM: We applied an LSTM model BIBREF20 to classify the sentences with pre-trained word embeddings;LSTM-soft: We then added a soft-attention BIBREF21 layer on top of the LSTM model where we computed soft alignment scores over each of the hidden states; LSTM-self: We applied a self-attention layer BIBREF22 to LSTM model. We denote the content vector as $c_i$ for each sentence $i$, as the input to the last classification layer.\nTopic-attention Model\nELMo ELMo is a new type of word representation introduced by BIBREF16 which considers contextual information captured by pre-trained BiLSTM language models. Similar works like BERT BIBREF23 and BioBERT BIBREF24 also consider context but with deeper structures. Compared with those models, ELMo has less parameters and not easy to be overfitting. We trained our ELMo model on the MIMIC-III corpus. Since some sentences also appear in the test set, one may raise the concern of performance inflation in testing. However, we pre-trained ELMo using the whole corpus of MIMIC in an unsupervised way, so the classification labels were not visible during training. To train the ELMo model, we adapted code from AllenNLP, we set the word embedding dimension to 64 and applied two BiLSTM layers. For all of our experiments that involved with ELMo, we initialized the word embeddings from the last layer of ELMo.\nTopic-attention We propose a neural topic-attention model for text classification. Our assumption is that the topic information plays an important role in doing the disambiguation given a sentence. For example, the abbreviation of the medical term FISH has two potential senses: general English fish as seafood and the sense of fluorescent in situ hybridization BIBREF17. The former case always goes with the topic of food, allergies while the other one appears in the topic of some examination test reports. In our model, a topic-attention module is applied to add topic information into the final sentence representation. This module calculates the distribution of topic-attention weights on a list of topic vectors. As shown in Figure SECREF5, we took the content vector $c_i$ (from soft-attention BIBREF22) and a topic matrix $T_{topic}=[t_1,t_2,..,t_j]$ (where each $t_i$ is a column vector in the figure and we illustrate four topics) as the inputs to the topic-attention module, and then calculated a weighted summation of the topic vectors. The final sentence representation $r_i$ for the sentence $i$ was calculated as the following:\nwhere $W_{topic}$ and $b _ { topic }$ are trainable parameters, $\\beta _{it}$ represents the topic-attention weights. The final sentence representation is denoted as $r_i$, and $[\\cdot ,\\cdot ]$ means concatenation. Here $s_i$ is the representation of the sentence which includes the topic information. The final sentence representation $r_i$ is the concatenation of $c_i$ and $s_i$, now we have both context-aware sentence representation and topic-related representation. Then we added a fully-connected layer, followed by a Softmax to do classification with cross-entropy loss function.\nTopic Matrix To generate the topic matrix $T_{topic}$ as in Equation DISPLAY_FORM9, we propose a convolution-based method to generate topic vectors. We first pre-trained a topic model using the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) BIBREF25 model on MIMIC-III notes as used by the ELMo model. We set the number of topics to be 50 and ran for 30 iterations. Then we were able to get a list of top $k$ words (we set $k=100$) for each topic. To get the topic vector $t$ for a specific topic:\nwhere $e_j$ (column vector) is the pre-trained Doc2vec word embedding for the top word $j$ from the current topic, and $Conv(\\cdot )$ indicates a convolutional layer; $maxpool(\\cdot )$ is a max pooling layer. We finally reshaped the output $t$ into a 1-dimension vector. Eventually we collected all topic vectors as the topic matrix $T_{topic}$ in Figure SECREF5.\nEvaluation\nWe did three groups of experiments including two baseline groups and our proposed model. The first group was the TF-IDF features in Section SECREF3 for traditional models. The Na\u00efve Bayesian classifier (NB) has the highest scores among all traditional methods. The second group of experiments used neural models described in Section SECREF3, where LSTM with self attention model (LSTM-self) has competitive results among this group, we choose this model as our base model. Notably, this is the first study that compares and evaluates LSTM-based models on the medical term abbreviation disambiguation task.\ntableExperimental Results: we report macro F1 in all the experiments. figureTopic-attention Model\nThe last group contains the results of our proposed model with different settings. We used Topic Only setting on top of the base model, where we only added the topic-attention layer, and all the word embeddings were from our pre-trained Doc2vec model and were fine-tuned during back propagation. We could observe that compared with the base model, we have an improvement of 7.36% on accuracy and 9.69% on F1 score. Another model (ELMo Only) is to initialize the word embeddings of the base model using the pre-trained ELMo model, and here no topic information was added. Here we have higher scores than Topic Only, and the accuracy and F1 score increased by 9.87% and 12.26% respectively compared with the base model. We then conducted a combination of both(ELMo+Topic), where the word embeddings from the sentences were computed from the pre-trained ELMo model, and the topic representations were from the pre-trained Doc2vec model. We have a remarkable increase of 12.27% on the accuracy and 14.86% on F1 score.\nTo further compare our proposed topic-attention model and the base model, we report an average of area under the curve(AUC) score among all 30 terms: the base model has an average AUC of 0.7189, and our topic-attention model (ELMo+Topic) achieves an average AUC of 0.8196. We provide a case study in Appendix SECREF9. The results show that the model can benefit from ELMo, which considers contextual features, and the topic-attention module, which brings in topic information. We can conclude that under the few-shot learning setting, our proposed model can better capture the sentence features when only limited training samples are explored in a small-scale dataset.\nConclusion\nIn this paper, we propose a neural topic-attention model with few-shot learning for medical abbreviation disambiguation task. We also manually cleaned and collected training and testing data for this task, which we release to promote related research in NLP with clinical notes. In addition, we evaluated and compared a comprehensive set of baseline models, some of which had never been applied to the medical term abbreviation disambiguation task. Future work would be to adapt other models like BioBERT or BERT to our proposed topic-attention model. We will also extend the method into other clinical notes tasks such as drug name recognition and ICD-9 code auto-assigning BIBREF26. In addition, other LDA-based approach can be investigated.\nDataset Details\nFigure FIGREF11 shows the histogram for the distribution of term-sense pair sample numbers. The X-axis gives the pair sample numbers and the Y-axis shows the counts. For example, the first bar shows that there are 43 term-sense pairs that have the sample number in the range of 0-50.\nWe also show histogram of class numbers for all terms in Figure FIGREF11. The Y-axis gives the counts while the X-axis gives the number of classes. For instance, the first bar means there are 12 terms contain 2 classes.\nTesting Dataset\nSince the training dataset is unbalanced and relatively small, it is hard to split it further into training and testing. Existing work BIBREF6, BIBREF5 conducted fold validation on the datasets and we found there are extreme rare senses for which only one or two samples exist. Besides, we believe that it is better to evaluate on a balanced dataset to determine whether it performs equally well on all classes. While most of the works deal with unbalanced training and testing that which may lead to very high accuracy if there is a dominating class in both training and testing set, the model may have a poor performance in rare testing cases because only a few samples have been seen during training. To be fair to all the classes, a good performance on these rare cases is also required otherwise it may lead to a severe situation. In this work, we are very interested to see how the model works among all senses especially the rare ones. Also, we can prevent the model from trivially predicting the dominant class and achieving high accuracy. As a result, we decided to create a dataset with the same number of samples for each case in the test dataset.\nOur testing dataset takes MIMIC-III BIBREF18 and PubMed as data sources. Here we are referring to all the notes data from MIMIC-III (NOTEEVENTS table ) and Case Reports articles from PubMed, as these contents are close to medical notes. To create the test set, we first followed the approach by BIBREF6 who applied an auto-generating method. Initially, we built a term-sense dictionary from the training dataset. Then we did matching for the sense words or phrases in the MIMIC-III notes dataset, and once there is a match, we replaced the words or phrases with the abbreviation term . We then asked two researchers with a medical background to check the matched samples manually with the following judgment: given this sentence and the abbreviation term and its sense, do you think the content is enough for you to guess the sense and whether this is the right sense? To estimate the agreement on the annotations, we selected a subset which contains 120 samples randomly and let the two annotators annotate individually. We got a Kappa score BIBREF27 of 0.96, which is considered as a near perfect agreement. We then distributed the work to the two annotators, and each of them labeled a half of the dataset, which means each sample was only labeled by a single annotator. For some rare term-sense pairs, we failed to find samples from MIMIC-III. The annotators then searched these senses via PubMed data source manually, aiming to find clinical notes-like sentences. They picked good sentences from these results as testing samples where the keywords exist and the content is informative. For those senses that are extremely rare, we let the annotators create sentences in the clinical note style as testing samples according to their experiences. Eventually, we have a balanced testing dataset, where each term-sense pair has around 15 samples for testing (on average, each pair has 14.56 samples and the median sample number is 15), and a comparison with training dataset is shown in Figure FIGREF11. Due to the difficulty for collecting the testing dataset, we decided to only collect for a random selection of 30 terms. On average, it took few hours to generate testing samples for each abbreviation term per researcher.\nCase Study\nWe now select two representative terms AC, IM and plot their receiver operating characteristic(ROC) curves. The term has a relatively large number of classes and the second one has extremely unbalanced training samples. We show the details in Table TABREF16. We have 8 classes in term AC. Figure FIGREF15(a) illustrates the results of our best performed model and Figure FIGREF15(b) shows the results of the base model. The accuracy and F1 score have an improvement from 0.3898 and 0.2830 to 0.4915 and 0.4059 respectively. Regarding the rare senses (for example, class 0, 1, 4 and 6), we can observe an increase in the ROC areas. Class 6 has an obvious improvement from 0.75 to 1.00. Such improvements in the rare senses make a huge difference in the reported average accuracy and F1 score, since we have a nearly equal number of samples for each class in the testing data. Similarly, we show the plots for IM term in Figure FIGREF15(c) and FIGREF15(d). IM has only two classes, but they are very unbalanced in training set, as shown in Table TABREF16. The accuracy and F1 scores improved from 0.6667 and 0.6250 to 0.8667 and 0.8667 respectively. We observe improvements in the ROC areas for both classes. This observation further shows that our model is more sensitive to all the class samples compared to the base model, even for the terms that have only a few samples in the training set. Again, by plotting the ROC curves and comparing AUC areas, we show that our model, which applies ELMo and topic-attention, has a better representation ability under the setting of few-shot learning.", "answers": ["7.36% on accuracy and 9.69% on F1 score", "it has 0.024 improvement in accuracy comparing to ELMO Only and  0.006 improvement in F1 score  comparing to ELMO Only too"], "length": 2890, "dataset": "qasper_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "d3944ab2d7e6cb9d6f722987f0406aa0aa01c8ace8608a89", "pred": " The improvements are significant, with an increase of 12.27% in accuracy and 14.86% in F1 score."}

Similarly, substantial improvements in performance have been obtained when deep learning algorithms have been applied to statistical speech processing BIBREF3 . These fundamental improvements have led researchers to investigate additional topics related to human nature, which have long been objects of study. One such topic involves understanding human emotions and reflecting it through machine intelligence, such as emotional dialogue models BIBREF4 , BIBREF5 .\nIn developing emotionally aware intelligence, the very first step is building robust emotion classifiers that display good performance regardless of the application; this outcome is considered to be one of the fundamental research goals in affective computing BIBREF6 . In particular, the speech emotion recognition task is one of the most important problems in the field of paralinguistics. This field has recently broadened its applications, as it is a crucial factor in optimal human-computer interactions, including dialog systems. The goal of speech emotion recognition is to predict the emotional content of speech and to classify speech according to one of several labels (i.e., happy, sad, neutral, and angry). Various types of deep learning methods have been applied to increase the performance of emotion classifiers; however, this task is still considered to be challenging for several reasons. First, insufficient data for training complex neural network-based models are available, due to the costs associated with human involvement. Second, the characteristics of emotions must be learned from low-level speech signals. Feature-based models display limited skills when applied to this problem.\nTo overcome these limitations, we propose a model that uses high-level text transcription, as well as low-level audio signals, to utilize the information contained within low-resource datasets to a greater degree. Given recent improvements in automatic speech recognition (ASR) technology BIBREF7 , BIBREF2 , BIBREF8 , BIBREF9 , speech transcription can be carried out using audio signals with considerable skill. The emotional content of speech is clearly indicated by the emotion words contained in a sentence BIBREF10 , such as \u201clovely\u201d and \u201cawesome,\u201d which carry strong emotions compared to generic (non-emotion) words, such as \u201cperson\u201d and \u201cday.\u201d Thus, we hypothesize that the speech emotion recognition model will be benefit from the incorporation of high-level textual input.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel deep dual recurrent encoder model that simultaneously utilizes audio and text data in recognizing emotions from speech. Extensive experiments are conducted to investigate the efficacy and properties of the proposed model. Our proposed model outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods by 68.8% to 71.8% when applied to the IEMOCAP dataset, which is one of the most well-studied datasets. Based on an error analysis of the models, we show that our proposed model accurately identifies emotion classes. Moreover, the neutral class misclassification bias frequently exhibited by previous models, which focus on audio features, is less pronounced in our model.\nRelated work\nClassical machine learning algorithms, such as hidden Markov models (HMMs), support vector machines (SVMs), and decision tree-based methods, have been employed in speech emotion recognition problems BIBREF11 , BIBREF12 , BIBREF13 . Recently, researchers have proposed various neural network-based architectures to improve the performance of speech emotion recognition. An initial study utilized deep neural networks (DNNs) to extract high-level features from raw audio data and demonstrated its effectiveness in speech emotion recognition BIBREF14 . With the advancement of deep learning methods, more complex neural-based architectures have been proposed. Convolutional neural network (CNN)-based models have been trained on information derived from raw audio signals using spectrograms or audio features such as Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) and low-level descriptors (LLDs) BIBREF15 , BIBREF16 , BIBREF17 . These neural network-based models are combined to produce higher-complexity models BIBREF18 , BIBREF19 , and these models achieved the best-recorded performance when applied to the IEMOCAP dataset.\nAnother line of research has focused on adopting variant machine learning techniques combined with neural network-based models. One researcher utilized the multiobject learning approach and used gender and naturalness as auxiliary tasks so that the neural network-based model learned more features from a given dataset BIBREF20 . Another researcher investigated transfer learning methods, leveraging external data from related domains BIBREF21 .\nAs emotional dialogue is composed of sound and spoken content, researchers have also investigated the combination of acoustic features and language information, built belief network-based methods of identifying emotional key phrases, and assessed the emotional salience of verbal cues from both phoneme sequences and words BIBREF22 , BIBREF23 . However, none of these studies have utilized information from speech signals and text sequences simultaneously in an end-to-end learning neural network-based model to classify emotions.\nModel\nThis section describes the methodologies that are applied to the speech emotion recognition task. We start by introducing the recurrent encoder model for the audio and text modalities individually. We then propose a multimodal approach that encodes both audio and textual information simultaneously via a dual recurrent encoder.\nAudio Recurrent Encoder (ARE)\nMotivated by the architecture used in BIBREF24 , BIBREF25 , we build an audio recurrent encoder (ARE) to predict the class of a given audio signal. Once MFCC features have been extracted from an audio signal, a subset of the sequential features is fed into the RNN (i.e., gated recurrent units (GRUs)), which leads to the formation of the network's internal hidden state INLINEFORM0 to model the time series patterns. This internal hidden state is updated at each time step with the input data INLINEFORM1 and the hidden state of the previous time step INLINEFORM2 as follows: DISPLAYFORM0\nwhere INLINEFORM0 is the RNN function with weight parameter INLINEFORM1 , INLINEFORM2 represents the hidden state at t- INLINEFORM3 time step, and INLINEFORM4 represents the t- INLINEFORM5 MFCC features in INLINEFORM6 . After encoding the audio signal INLINEFORM7 with the RNN, the last hidden state of the RNN, INLINEFORM8 , is considered to be the representative vector that contains all of the sequential audio data. This vector is then concatenated with another prosodic feature vector, INLINEFORM9 , to generate a more informative vector representation of the signal, INLINEFORM10 . The MFCC and the prosodic features are extracted from the audio signal using the openSMILE toolkit BIBREF26 , INLINEFORM11 , respectively. Finally, the emotion class is predicted by applying the softmax function to the vector INLINEFORM12 . For a given audio sample INLINEFORM13 , we assume that INLINEFORM14 is the true label vector, which contains all zeros but contains a one at the correct class, and INLINEFORM15 is the predicted probability distribution from the softmax layer. The training objective then takes the following form: DISPLAYFORM0\nwhere INLINEFORM0 is the calculated representative vector of the audio signal with dimensionality INLINEFORM1 . The INLINEFORM2 and the bias INLINEFORM3 are learned model parameters. C is the total number of classes, and N is the total number of samples used in training. The upper part of Figure shows the architecture of the ARE model.\nText Recurrent Encoder (TRE)\nWe assume that speech transcripts can be extracted from audio signals with high accuracy, given the advancement of ASR technologies BIBREF7 . We attempt to use the processed textual information as another modality in predicting the emotion class of a given signal. To use textual information, a speech transcript is tokenized and indexed into a sequence of tokens using the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) BIBREF27 . Each token is then passed through a word-embedding layer that converts a word index to a corresponding 300-dimensional vector that contains additional contextual meaning between words. The sequence of embedded tokens is fed into a text recurrent encoder (TRE) in such a way that the audio MFCC features are encoded using the ARE represented by equation EQREF2 . In this case, INLINEFORM0 is the t- INLINEFORM1 embedded token from the text input. Finally, the emotion class is predicted from the last hidden state of the text-RNN using the softmax function.\nWe use the same training objective as the ARE model, and the predicted probability distribution for the target class is as follows: DISPLAYFORM0\nwhere INLINEFORM0 is last hidden state of the text-RNN, INLINEFORM1 , and the INLINEFORM2 and bias INLINEFORM3 are learned model parameters. The lower part of Figure indicates the architecture of the TRE model.\nMultimodal Dual Recurrent Encoder (MDRE)\nWe present a novel architecture called the multimodal dual recurrent encoder (MDRE) to overcome the limitations of existing approaches. In this study, we consider multiple modalities, such as MFCC features, prosodic features and transcripts, which contain sequential audio information, statistical audio information and textual information, respectively. These types of data are the same as those used in the ARE and TRE cases. The MDRE model employs two RNNs to encode data from the audio signal and textual inputs independently. The audio-RNN encodes MFCC features from the audio signal using equation EQREF2 . The last hidden state of the audio-RNN is concatenated with the prosodic features to form the final vector representation INLINEFORM0 , and this vector is then passed through a fully connected neural network layer to form the audio encoding vector A. On the other hand, the text-RNN encodes the word sequence of the transcript using equation EQREF2 . The final hidden states of the text-RNN are also passed through another fully connected neural network layer to form a textual encoding vector T. Finally, the emotion class is predicted by applying the softmax function to the concatenation of the vectors A and T. We use the same training objective as the ARE model, and the predicted probability distribution for the target class is as follows: DISPLAYFORM0\nwhere INLINEFORM0 is the feed-forward neural network with weight parameter INLINEFORM1 , and INLINEFORM2 , INLINEFORM3 are final encoding vectors from the audio-RNN and text-RNN, respectively. INLINEFORM4 and the bias INLINEFORM5 are learned model parameters.\nMultimodal Dual Recurrent Encoder with Attention (MDREA)\nInspired by the concept of the attention mechanism used in neural machine translation BIBREF28 , we propose a novel multimodal attention method to focus on the specific parts of a transcript that contain strong emotional information, conditioning on the audio information. Figure shows the architecture of the MDREA model. First, the audio data and text data are encoded with the audio-RNN and text-RNN using equation EQREF2 . We then consider the final audio encoding vector INLINEFORM0 as a context vector. As seen in equation EQREF9 , during each time step t, the dot product between the context vector e and the hidden state of the text-RNN at each t-th sequence INLINEFORM1 is evaluated to calculate a similarity score INLINEFORM2 . Using this score INLINEFORM3 as a weight parameter, the weighted sum of the sequences of the hidden state of the text-RNN, INLINEFORM4 , is calculated to generate an attention-application vector Z. This attention-application vector is concatenated with the final encoding vector of the audio-RNN INLINEFORM5 (equation EQREF7 ), which will be passed through the softmax function to predict the emotion class. We use the same training objective as the ARE model, and the predicted probability distribution for the target class is as follows: DISPLAYFORM0\nwhere INLINEFORM0 and the bias INLINEFORM1 are learned model parameters.\nDataset\nWe evaluate our model using the Interactive Emotional Dyadic Motion Capture (IEMOCAP) BIBREF18 dataset. This dataset was collected following theatrical theory in order to simulate natural dyadic interactions between actors. We use categorical evaluations with majority agreement. We use only four emotional categories happy, sad, angry, and neutral to compare the performance of our model with other research using the same categories. The IEMOCAP dataset includes five sessions, and each session contains utterances from two speakers (one male and one female). This data collection process resulted in 10 unique speakers. For consistent comparison with previous work, we merge the excitement dataset with the happiness dataset. The final dataset contains a total of 5531 utterances (1636 happy, 1084 sad, 1103 angry, 1708 neutral).\nFeature extraction\nTo extract speech information from audio signals, we use MFCC values, which are widely used in analyzing audio signals. The MFCC feature set contains a total of 39 features, which include 12 MFCC parameters (1-12) from the 26 Mel-frequency bands and log-energy parameters, 13 delta and 13 acceleration coefficients The frame size is set to 25 ms at a rate of 10 ms with the Hamming function. According to the length of each wave file, the sequential step of the MFCC features is varied. To extract additional information from the data, we also use prosodic features, which show effectiveness in affective computing. The prosodic features are composed of 35 features, which include the F0 frequency, the voicing probability, and the loudness contours. All of these MFCC and prosodic features are extracted from the data using the OpenSMILE toolkit BIBREF26 .\nImplementation details\nAmong the variants of the RNN function, we use GRUs as they yield comparable performance to that of the LSTM and include a smaller number of weight parameters BIBREF29 . We use a max encoder step of 750 for the audio input, based on the implementation choices presented in BIBREF30 and 128 for the text input because it covers the maximum length of the transcripts. The vocabulary size of the dataset is 3,747, including the \u201c_UNK_\" token, which represents unknown words, and the \u201c_PAD_\" token, which is used to indicate padding information added while preparing mini-batch data. The number of hidden units and the number of layers in the RNN for each model (ARE, TRE, MDRE and MDREA) are selected based on extensive hyperparameter search experiments. The weights of the hidden units are initialized using orthogonal weights BIBREF31 ], and the text embedding layer is initialized from pretrained word-embedding vectors BIBREF32 .\nIn preparing the textual dataset, we first use the released transcripts of the IEMOCAP dataset for simplicity. To investigate the practical performance, we then process all of the IEMOCAP audio data using an ASR system (the Google Cloud Speech API) and retrieve the transcripts. The performance of the Google ASR system is reflected by its word error rate (WER) of 5.53%.\nPerformance evaluation\nAs the dataset is not explicitly split beforehand into training, development, and testing sets, we perform 5-fold cross validation to determine the overall performance of the model. The data in each fold are split into training, development, and testing datasets (8:0.5:1.5, respectively). After training the model, we measure the weighted average precision (WAP) over the 5-fold dataset. We train and evaluate the model 10 times per fold, and the model performance is assessed in terms of the mean score and standard deviation.\nWe examine the WAP values, which are shown in Table 1. First, our ARE model shows the baseline performance because we use minimal audio features, such as the MFCC and prosodic features with simple architectures. On the other hand, the TRE model shows higher performance gain compared to the ARE. From this result, we note that textual data are informative in emotion prediction tasks, and the recurrent encoder model is effective in understanding these types of sequential data. Second, the newly proposed model, MDRE, shows a substantial performance gain. It thus achieves the state-of-the-art performance with a WAP value of 0.718. This result shows that multimodal information is a key factor in affective computing. Lastly, the attention model, MDREA, also outperforms the best existing research results (WAP 0.690 to 0.688) BIBREF19 . However, the MDREA model does not match the performance of the MDRE model, even though it utilizes a more complex architecture. We believe that this result arises because insufficient data are available to properly determine the complex model parameters in the MDREA model. Moreover, we presume that this model will show better performance when the audio signals are aligned with the textual sequence while applying the attention mechanism. We leave the implementation of this point as a future research direction.\nTo investigate the practical performance of the proposed models, we conduct further experiments with the ASR-processed transcript data (see \u201c-ASR\u201d models in Table ). The label accuracy of the processed transcripts is 5.53% WER. The TRE-ASR, MDRE-ASR and MDREA-ASR models reflect degraded performance compared to that of the TRE, MDRE and MDREA models. However, the performance of these models is still competitive; in particular, the MDRE-ASR model outperforms the previous best-performing model, 3CNN-LSTM10H (WAP 0.691 to 0.688).\nError analysis\nWe analyze the predictions of the ARE, TRE, and MDRE models. Figure shows the confusion matrix of each model. The ARE model (Fig. ) incorrectly classifies most instances of happy as neutral (43.51%); thus, it shows reduced accuracy (35.15%) in predicting the the happy class. Overall, most of the emotion classes are frequently confused with the neutral class. This observation is in line with the findings of BIBREF30 , who noted that the neutral class is located in the center of the activation-valence space, complicating its discrimination from the other classes.\nInterestingly, the TRE model (Fig. ) shows greater prediction gains in predicting the happy class when compared to the ARE model (35.15% to 75.73%). This result seems plausible because the model can benefit from the differences among the distributions of words in happy and neutral expressions, which gives more emotional information to the model than that of the audio signal data. On the other hand, it is striking that the TRE model incorrectly predicts instances of the sad class as the happy class 16.20% of the time, even though these emotional states are opposites of one another.\nThe MDRE model (Fig. ) compensates for the weaknesses of the previous two models (ARE and TRE) and benefits from their strengths to a surprising degree. The values arranged along the diagonal axis show that all of the accuracies of the correctly predicted class have increased. Furthermore, the occurrence of the incorrect \u201csad-to-happy\" cases in the TRE model is reduced from 16.20% to 9.15%.\nConclusions\nIn this paper, we propose a novel multimodal dual recurrent encoder model that simultaneously utilizes text data, as well as audio signals, to permit the better understanding of speech data. Our model encodes the information from audio and text sequences using dual RNNs and then combines the information from these sources using a feed-forward neural model to predict the emotion class. Extensive experiments show that our proposed model outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in classifying the four emotion categories, and accuracies ranging from 68.8% to 71.8% are obtained when the model is applied to the IEMOCAP dataset. In particular, it resolves the issue in which predictions frequently incorrectly yield the neutral class, as occurs in previous models that focus on audio features.\nIn the future work, we aim to extend the modalities to audio, text and video inputs. Furthermore, we plan to investigate the application of the attention mechanism to data derived from multiple modalities. This approach seems likely to uncover enhanced learning schemes that will increase performance in both speech emotion recognition and other multimodal classification tasks.\nAcknowledgments\nK.

Similarly, substantial improvements in performance have been obtained when deep learning algorithms have been applied to statistical speech processing BIBREF3 . These fundamental improvements have led researchers to investigate additional topics related to human nature, which have long been objects of study. One such topic involves understanding human emotions and reflecting it through machine intelligence, such as emotional dialogue models BIBREF4 , BIBREF5 .\nIn developing emotionally aware intelligence, the very first step is building robust emotion classifiers that display good performance regardless of the application; this outcome is considered to be one of the fundamental research goals in affective computing BIBREF6 . In particular, the speech emotion recognition task is one of the most important problems in the field of paralinguistics. This field has recently broadened its applications, as it is a crucial factor in optimal human-computer interactions, including dialog systems. The goal of speech emotion recognition is to predict the emotional content of speech and to classify speech according to one of several labels (i.e., happy, sad, neutral, and angry). Various types of deep learning methods have been applied to increase the performance of emotion classifiers; however, this task is still considered to be challenging for several reasons. First, insufficient data for training complex neural network-based models are available, due to the costs associated with human involvement. Second, the characteristics of emotions must be learned from low-level speech signals. Feature-based models display limited skills when applied to this problem.\nTo overcome these limitations, we propose a model that uses high-level text transcription, as well as low-level audio signals, to utilize the information contained within low-resource datasets to a greater degree. Given recent improvements in automatic speech recognition (ASR) technology BIBREF7 , BIBREF2 , BIBREF8 , BIBREF9 , speech transcription can be carried out using audio signals with considerable skill. The emotional content of speech is clearly indicated by the emotion words contained in a sentence BIBREF10 , such as \u201clovely\u201d and \u201cawesome,\u201d which carry strong emotions compared to generic (non-emotion) words, such as \u201cperson\u201d and \u201cday.\u201d Thus, we hypothesize that the speech emotion recognition model will be benefit from the incorporation of high-level textual input.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel deep dual recurrent encoder model that simultaneously utilizes audio and text data in recognizing emotions from speech. Extensive experiments are conducted to investigate the efficacy and properties of the proposed model. Our proposed model outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods by 68.8% to 71.8% when applied to the IEMOCAP dataset, which is one of the most well-studied datasets. Based on an error analysis of the models, we show that our proposed model accurately identifies emotion classes. Moreover, the neutral class misclassification bias frequently exhibited by previous models, which focus on audio features, is less pronounced in our model.\nRelated work\nClassical machine learning algorithms, such as hidden Markov models (HMMs), support vector machines (SVMs), and decision tree-based methods, have been employed in speech emotion recognition problems BIBREF11 , BIBREF12 , BIBREF13 . Recently, researchers have proposed various neural network-based architectures to improve the performance of speech emotion recognition. An initial study utilized deep neural networks (DNNs) to extract high-level features from raw audio data and demonstrated its effectiveness in speech emotion recognition BIBREF14 . With the advancement of deep learning methods, more complex neural-based architectures have been proposed. Convolutional neural network (CNN)-based models have been trained on information derived from raw audio signals using spectrograms or audio features such as Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) and low-level descriptors (LLDs) BIBREF15 , BIBREF16 , BIBREF17 . These neural network-based models are combined to produce higher-complexity models BIBREF18 , BIBREF19 , and these models achieved the best-recorded performance when applied to the IEMOCAP dataset.\nAnother line of research has focused on adopting variant machine learning techniques combined with neural network-based models. One researcher utilized the multiobject learning approach and used gender and naturalness as auxiliary tasks so that the neural network-based model learned more features from a given dataset BIBREF20 . Another researcher investigated transfer learning methods, leveraging external data from related domains BIBREF21 .\nAs emotional dialogue is composed of sound and spoken content, researchers have also investigated the combination of acoustic features and language information, built belief network-based methods of identifying emotional key phrases, and assessed the emotional salience of verbal cues from both phoneme sequences and words BIBREF22 , BIBREF23 . However, none of these studies have utilized information from speech signals and text sequences simultaneously in an end-to-end learning neural network-based model to classify emotions.\nModel\nThis section describes the methodologies that are applied to the speech emotion recognition task. We start by introducing the recurrent encoder model for the audio and text modalities individually. We then propose a multimodal approach that encodes both audio and textual information simultaneously via a dual recurrent encoder.\nAudio Recurrent Encoder (ARE)\nMotivated by the architecture used in BIBREF24 , BIBREF25 , we build an audio recurrent encoder (ARE) to predict the class of a given audio signal. Once MFCC features have been extracted from an audio signal, a subset of the sequential features is fed into the RNN (i.e., gated recurrent units (GRUs)), which leads to the formation of the network's internal hidden state INLINEFORM0 to model the time series patterns. This internal hidden state is updated at each time step with the input data INLINEFORM1 and the hidden state of the previous time step INLINEFORM2 as follows: DISPLAYFORM0\nwhere INLINEFORM0 is the RNN function with weight parameter INLINEFORM1 , INLINEFORM2 represents the hidden state at t- INLINEFORM3 time step, and INLINEFORM4 represents the t- INLINEFORM5 MFCC features in INLINEFORM6 . After encoding the audio signal INLINEFORM7 with the RNN, the last hidden state of the RNN, INLINEFORM8 , is considered to be the representative vector that contains all of the sequential audio data. This vector is then concatenated with another prosodic feature vector, INLINEFORM9 , to generate a more informative vector representation of the signal, INLINEFORM10 . The MFCC and the prosodic features are extracted from the audio signal using the openSMILE toolkit BIBREF26 , INLINEFORM11 , respectively. Finally, the emotion class is predicted by applying the softmax function to the vector INLINEFORM12 . For a given audio sample INLINEFORM13 , we assume that INLINEFORM14 is the true label vector, which contains all zeros but contains a one at the correct class, and INLINEFORM15 is the predicted probability distribution from the softmax layer. The training objective then takes the following form: DISPLAYFORM0\nwhere INLINEFORM0 is the calculated representative vector of the audio signal with dimensionality INLINEFORM1 . The INLINEFORM2 and the bias INLINEFORM3 are learned model parameters. C is the total number of classes, and N is the total number of samples used in training. The upper part of Figure shows the architecture of the ARE model.\nText Recurrent Encoder (TRE)\nWe assume that speech transcripts can be extracted from audio signals with high accuracy, given the advancement of ASR technologies BIBREF7 . We attempt to use the processed textual information as another modality in predicting the emotion class of a given signal. To use textual information, a speech transcript is tokenized and indexed into a sequence of tokens using the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) BIBREF27 . Each token is then passed through a word-embedding layer that converts a word index to a corresponding 300-dimensional vector that contains additional contextual meaning between words. The sequence of embedded tokens is fed into a text recurrent encoder (TRE) in such a way that the audio MFCC features are encoded using the ARE represented by equation EQREF2 . In this case, INLINEFORM0 is the t- INLINEFORM1 embedded token from the text input. Finally, the emotion class is predicted from the last hidden state of the text-RNN using the softmax function.\nWe use the same training objective as the ARE model, and the predicted probability distribution for the target class is as follows: DISPLAYFORM0\nwhere INLINEFORM0 is last hidden state of the text-RNN, INLINEFORM1 , and the INLINEFORM2 and bias INLINEFORM3 are learned model parameters. The lower part of Figure indicates the architecture of the TRE model.\nMultimodal Dual Recurrent Encoder (MDRE)\nWe present a novel architecture called the multimodal dual recurrent encoder (MDRE) to overcome the limitations of existing approaches. In this study, we consider multiple modalities, such as MFCC features, prosodic features and transcripts, which contain sequential audio information, statistical audio information and textual information, respectively. These types of data are the same as those used in the ARE and TRE cases. The MDRE model employs two RNNs to encode data from the audio signal and textual inputs independently. The audio-RNN encodes MFCC features from the audio signal using equation EQREF2 . The last hidden state of the audio-RNN is concatenated with the prosodic features to form the final vector representation INLINEFORM0 , and this vector is then passed through a fully connected neural network layer to form the audio encoding vector A. On the other hand, the text-RNN encodes the word sequence of the transcript using equation EQREF2 . The final hidden states of the text-RNN are also passed through another fully connected neural network layer to form a textual encoding vector T. Finally, the emotion class is predicted by applying the softmax function to the concatenation of the vectors A and T. We use the same training objective as the ARE model, and the predicted probability distribution for the target class is as follows: DISPLAYFORM0\nwhere INLINEFORM0 is the feed-forward neural network with weight parameter INLINEFORM1 , and INLINEFORM2 , INLINEFORM3 are final encoding vectors from the audio-RNN and text-RNN, respectively. INLINEFORM4 and the bias INLINEFORM5 are learned model parameters.\nMultimodal Dual Recurrent Encoder with Attention (MDREA)\nInspired by the concept of the attention mechanism used in neural machine translation BIBREF28 , we propose a novel multimodal attention method to focus on the specific parts of a transcript that contain strong emotional information, conditioning on the audio information. Figure shows the architecture of the MDREA model. First, the audio data and text data are encoded with the audio-RNN and text-RNN using equation EQREF2 . We then consider the final audio encoding vector INLINEFORM0 as a context vector. As seen in equation EQREF9 , during each time step t, the dot product between the context vector e and the hidden state of the text-RNN at each t-th sequence INLINEFORM1 is evaluated to calculate a similarity score INLINEFORM2 . Using this score INLINEFORM3 as a weight parameter, the weighted sum of the sequences of the hidden state of the text-RNN, INLINEFORM4 , is calculated to generate an attention-application vector Z. This attention-application vector is concatenated with the final encoding vector of the audio-RNN INLINEFORM5 (equation EQREF7 ), which will be passed through the softmax function to predict the emotion class. We use the same training objective as the ARE model, and the predicted probability distribution for the target class is as follows: DISPLAYFORM0\nwhere INLINEFORM0 and the bias INLINEFORM1 are learned model parameters.\nDataset\nWe evaluate our model using the Interactive Emotional Dyadic Motion Capture (IEMOCAP) BIBREF18 dataset. This dataset was collected following theatrical theory in order to simulate natural dyadic interactions between actors. We use categorical evaluations with majority agreement. We use only four emotional categories happy, sad, angry, and neutral to compare the performance of our model with other research using the same categories. The IEMOCAP dataset includes five sessions, and each session contains utterances from two speakers (one male and one female). This data collection process resulted in 10 unique speakers. For consistent comparison with previous work, we merge the excitement dataset with the happiness dataset. The final dataset contains a total of 5531 utterances (1636 happy, 1084 sad, 1103 angry, 1708 neutral).\nFeature extraction\nTo extract speech information from audio signals, we use MFCC values, which are widely used in analyzing audio signals. The MFCC feature set contains a total of 39 features, which include 12 MFCC parameters (1-12) from the 26 Mel-frequency bands and log-energy parameters, 13 delta and 13 acceleration coefficients The frame size is set to 25 ms at a rate of 10 ms with the Hamming function. According to the length of each wave file, the sequential step of the MFCC features is varied. To extract additional information from the data, we also use prosodic features, which show effectiveness in affective computing. The prosodic features are composed of 35 features, which include the F0 frequency, the voicing probability, and the loudness contours. All of these MFCC and prosodic features are extracted from the data using the OpenSMILE toolkit BIBREF26 .\nImplementation details\nAmong the variants of the RNN function, we use GRUs as they yield comparable performance to that of the LSTM and include a smaller number of weight parameters BIBREF29 . We use a max encoder step of 750 for the audio input, based on the implementation choices presented in BIBREF30 and 128 for the text input because it covers the maximum length of the transcripts. The vocabulary size of the dataset is 3,747, including the \u201c_UNK_\" token, which represents unknown words, and the \u201c_PAD_\" token, which is used to indicate padding information added while preparing mini-batch data. The number of hidden units and the number of layers in the RNN for each model (ARE, TRE, MDRE and MDREA) are selected based on extensive hyperparameter search experiments. The weights of the hidden units are initialized using orthogonal weights BIBREF31 ], and the text embedding layer is initialized from pretrained word-embedding vectors BIBREF32 .\nIn preparing the textual dataset, we first use the released transcripts of the IEMOCAP dataset for simplicity. To investigate the practical performance, we then process all of the IEMOCAP audio data using an ASR system (the Google Cloud Speech API) and retrieve the transcripts. The performance of the Google ASR system is reflected by its word error rate (WER) of 5.53%.\nPerformance evaluation\nAs the dataset is not explicitly split beforehand into training, development, and testing sets, we perform 5-fold cross validation to determine the overall performance of the model. The data in each fold are split into training, development, and testing datasets (8:0.5:1.5, respectively). After training the model, we measure the weighted average precision (WAP) over the 5-fold dataset. We train and evaluate the model 10 times per fold, and the model performance is assessed in terms of the mean score and standard deviation.\nWe examine the WAP values, which are shown in Table 1. First, our ARE model shows the baseline performance because we use minimal audio features, such as the MFCC and prosodic features with simple architectures. On the other hand, the TRE model shows higher performance gain compared to the ARE. From this result, we note that textual data are informative in emotion prediction tasks, and the recurrent encoder model is effective in understanding these types of sequential data. Second, the newly proposed model, MDRE, shows a substantial performance gain. It thus achieves the state-of-the-art performance with a WAP value of 0.718. This result shows that multimodal information is a key factor in affective computing. Lastly, the attention model, MDREA, also outperforms the best existing research results (WAP 0.690 to 0.688) BIBREF19 . However, the MDREA model does not match the performance of the MDRE model, even though it utilizes a more complex architecture. We believe that this result arises because insufficient data are available to properly determine the complex model parameters in the MDREA model. Moreover, we presume that this model will show better performance when the audio signals are aligned with the textual sequence while applying the attention mechanism. We leave the implementation of this point as a future research direction.\nTo investigate the practical performance of the proposed models, we conduct further experiments with the ASR-processed transcript data (see \u201c-ASR\u201d models in Table ). The label accuracy of the processed transcripts is 5.53% WER. The TRE-ASR, MDRE-ASR and MDREA-ASR models reflect degraded performance compared to that of the TRE, MDRE and MDREA models. However, the performance of these models is still competitive; in particular, the MDRE-ASR model outperforms the previous best-performing model, 3CNN-LSTM10H (WAP 0.691 to 0.688).\nError analysis\nWe analyze the predictions of the ARE, TRE, and MDRE models. Figure shows the confusion matrix of each model. The ARE model (Fig. ) incorrectly classifies most instances of happy as neutral (43.51%); thus, it shows reduced accuracy (35.15%) in predicting the the happy class. Overall, most of the emotion classes are frequently confused with the neutral class. This observation is in line with the findings of BIBREF30 , who noted that the neutral class is located in the center of the activation-valence space, complicating its discrimination from the other classes.\nInterestingly, the TRE model (Fig. ) shows greater prediction gains in predicting the happy class when compared to the ARE model (35.15% to 75.73%). This result seems plausible because the model can benefit from the differences among the distributions of words in happy and neutral expressions, which gives more emotional information to the model than that of the audio signal data. On the other hand, it is striking that the TRE model incorrectly predicts instances of the sad class as the happy class 16.20% of the time, even though these emotional states are opposites of one another.\nThe MDRE model (Fig. ) compensates for the weaknesses of the previous two models (ARE and TRE) and benefits from their strengths to a surprising degree. The values arranged along the diagonal axis show that all of the accuracies of the correctly predicted class have increased. Furthermore, the occurrence of the incorrect \u201csad-to-happy\" cases in the TRE model is reduced from 16.20% to 9.15%.\nConclusions\nIn this paper, we propose a novel multimodal dual recurrent encoder model that simultaneously utilizes text data, as well as audio signals, to permit the better understanding of speech data. Our model encodes the information from audio and text sequences using dual RNNs and then combines the information from these sources using a feed-forward neural model to predict the emotion class. Extensive experiments show that our proposed model outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in classifying the four emotion categories, and accuracies ranging from 68.8% to 71.8% are obtained when the model is applied to the IEMOCAP dataset. In particular, it resolves the issue in which predictions frequently incorrectly yield the neutral class, as occurs in previous models that focus on audio features.\nIn the future work, we aim to extend the modalities to audio, text and video inputs. Furthermore, we plan to investigate the application of the attention mechanism to data derived from multiple modalities. This approach seems likely to uncover enhanced learning schemes that will increase performance in both speech emotion recognition and other multimodal classification tasks.\nAcknowledgments\nK.

The PA process enables an organization to periodically measure and evaluate every employee's performance. It also provides a mechanism to link the goals established by the organization to its each employee's day-to-day activities and performance. Design and analysis of PA processes is a lively area of research within the HR community BIBREF0 , BIBREF1 , BIBREF2 , BIBREF3 .\nThe PA process in any modern organization is nowadays implemented and tracked through an IT system (the PA system) that records the interactions that happen in various steps. Availability of this data in a computer-readable database opens up opportunities to analyze it using automated statistical, data-mining and text-mining techniques, to generate novel and actionable insights / patterns and to help in improving the quality and effectiveness of the PA process BIBREF4 , BIBREF5 , BIBREF6 . Automated analysis of large-scale PA data is now facilitated by technological and algorithmic advances, and is becoming essential for large organizations containing thousands of geographically distributed employees handling a wide variety of roles and tasks.\nA typical PA process involves purposeful multi-step multi-modal communication between employees, their supervisors and their peers. In most PA processes, the communication includes the following steps: (i) in self-appraisal, an employee records his/her achievements, activities, tasks handled etc.; (ii) in supervisor assessment, the supervisor provides the criticism, evaluation and suggestions for improvement of performance etc.; and (iii) in peer feedback (aka INLINEFORM0 view), the peers of the employee provide their feedback. There are several business questions that managers are interested in. Examples:\nIn this paper, we develop text mining techniques that can automatically produce answers to these questions. Since the intended users are HR executives, ideally, the techniques should work with minimum training data and experimentation with parameter setting. These techniques have been implemented and are being used in a PA system in a large multi-national IT company.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section SECREF2 summarizes related work. Section SECREF3 summarizes the PA dataset used in this paper. Section SECREF4 applies sentence classification algorithms to automatically discover three important classes of sentences in the PA corpus viz., sentences that discuss strengths, weaknesses of employees and contain suggestions for improving her performance. Section SECREF5 considers the problem of mapping the actual targets mentioned in strengths, weaknesses and suggestions to a fixed set of attributes. In Section SECREF6 , we discuss how the feedback from peers for a particular employee can be summarized. In Section SECREF7 we draw conclusions and identify some further work.\nRelated Work\nWe first review some work related to sentence classification. Semantically classifying sentences (based on the sentence's purpose) is a much harder task, and is gaining increasing attention from linguists and NLP researchers. McKnight and Srinivasan BIBREF7 and Yamamoto and Takagi BIBREF8 used SVM to classify sentences in biomedical abstracts into classes such as INTRODUCTION, BACKGROUND, PURPOSE, METHOD, RESULT, CONCLUSION. Cohen et al. BIBREF9 applied SVM and other techniques to learn classifiers for sentences in emails into classes, which are speech acts defined by a verb-noun pair, with verbs such as request, propose, amend, commit, deliver and nouns such as meeting, document, committee; see also BIBREF10 . Khoo et al. BIBREF11 uses various classifiers to classify sentences in emails into classes such as APOLOGY, INSTRUCTION, QUESTION, REQUEST, SALUTATION, STATEMENT, SUGGESTION, THANKING etc. Qadir and Riloff BIBREF12 proposes several filters and classifiers to classify sentences on message boards (community QA systems) into 4 speech acts: COMMISSIVE (speaker commits to a future action), DIRECTIVE (speaker expects listener to take some action), EXPRESSIVE (speaker expresses his or her psychological state to the listener), REPRESENTATIVE (represents the speaker's belief of something). Hachey and Grover BIBREF13 used SVM and maximum entropy classifiers to classify sentences in legal documents into classes such as FACT, PROCEEDINGS, BACKGROUND, FRAMING, DISPOSAL; see also BIBREF14 . Deshpande et al. BIBREF15 proposes unsupervised linguistic patterns to classify sentences into classes SUGGESTION, COMPLAINT.\nThere is much work on a closely related problem viz., classifying sentences in dialogues through dialogue-specific categories called dialogue acts BIBREF16 , which we will not review here. Just as one example, Cotterill BIBREF17 classifies questions in emails into the dialogue acts of YES_NO_QUESTION, WH_QUESTION, ACTION_REQUEST, RHETORICAL, MULTIPLE_CHOICE etc.\nWe could not find much work related to mining of performance appraisals data. Pawar et al. BIBREF18 uses kernel-based classification to classify sentences in both performance appraisal text and product reviews into classes SUGGESTION, APPRECIATION, COMPLAINT. Apte et al. BIBREF6 provides two algorithms for matching the descriptions of goals or tasks assigned to employees to a standard template of model goals. One algorithm is based on the co-training framework and uses goal descriptions and self-appraisal comments as two separate perspectives. The second approach uses semantic similarity under a weak supervision framework. Ramrakhiyani et al. BIBREF5 proposes label propagation algorithms to discover aspects in supervisor assessments in performance appraisals, where an aspect is modelled as a verb-noun pair (e.g. conduct training, improve coding).\nDataset\nIn this paper, we used the supervisor assessment and peer feedback text produced during the performance appraisal of 4528 employees in a large multi-national IT company. The corpus of supervisor assessment has 26972 sentences. The summary statistics about the number of words in a sentence is: min:4 max:217 average:15.5 STDEV:9.2 Q1:9 Q2:14 Q3:19.\nSentence Classification\nThe PA corpus contains several classes of sentences that are of interest. In this paper, we focus on three important classes of sentences viz., sentences that discuss strengths (class STRENGTH), weaknesses of employees (class WEAKNESS) and suggestions for improving her performance (class SUGGESTION). The strengths or weaknesses are mostly about the performance in work carried out, but sometimes they can be about the working style or other personal qualities. The classes WEAKNESS and SUGGESTION are somewhat overlapping; e.g., a suggestion may address a perceived weakness. Following are two example sentences in each class.\nSTRENGTH:\nWEAKNESS:\nSUGGESTION:\nSeveral linguistic aspects of these classes of sentences are apparent. The subject is implicit in many sentences. The strengths are often mentioned as either noun phrases (NP) with positive adjectives (Excellent technology leadership) or positive nouns (engineering strength) or through verbs with positive polarity (dedicated) or as verb phrases containing positive adjectives (delivers innovative solutions). Similarly for weaknesses, where negation is more frequently used (presentations are not his forte), or alternatively, the polarities of verbs (avoid) or adjectives (poor) tend to be negative. However, sometimes the form of both the strengths and weaknesses is the same, typically a stand-alone sentiment-neutral NP, making it difficult to distinguish between them; e.g., adherence to timing or timely closure. Suggestions often have an imperative mood and contain secondary verbs such as need to, should, has to. Suggestions are sometimes expressed using comparatives (better process compliance). We built a simple set of patterns for each of the 3 classes on the POS-tagged form of the sentences. We use each set of these patterns as an unsupervised sentence classifier for that class. If a particular sentence matched with patterns for multiple classes, then we have simple tie-breaking rules for picking the final class. The pattern for the STRENGTH class looks for the presence of positive words / phrases like takes ownership, excellent, hard working, commitment, etc. Similarly, the pattern for the WEAKNESS class looks for the presence of negative words / phrases like lacking, diffident, slow learner, less focused, etc. The SUGGESTION pattern not only looks for keywords like should, needs to but also for POS based pattern like \u201ca verb in the base form (VB) in the beginning of a sentence\u201d.\nWe randomly selected 2000 sentences from the supervisor assessment corpus and manually tagged them (dataset D1). This labelled dataset contained 705, 103, 822 and 370 sentences having the class labels STRENGTH, WEAKNESS, SUGGESTION or OTHER respectively. We trained several multi-class classifiers on this dataset. Table TABREF10 shows the results of 5-fold cross-validation experiments on dataset D1. For the first 5 classifiers, we used their implementation from the SciKit Learn library in Python (scikit-learn.org). The features used for these classifiers were simply the sentence words along with their frequencies. For the last 2 classifiers (in Table TABREF10 ), we used our own implementation. The overall accuracy for a classifier is defined as INLINEFORM0 , where the denominator is 2000 for dataset D1. Note that the pattern-based approach is unsupervised i.e., it did not use any training data. Hence, the results shown for it are for the entire dataset and not based on cross-validation.\nComparison with Sentiment Analyzer\nWe also explored whether a sentiment analyzer can be used as a baseline for identifying the class labels STRENGTH and WEAKNESS. We used an implementation of sentiment analyzer from TextBlob to get a polarity score for each sentence. Table TABREF13 shows the distribution of positive, negative and neutral sentiments across the 3 class labels STRENGTH, WEAKNESS and SUGGESTION. It can be observed that distribution of positive and negative sentiments is almost similar in STRENGTH as well as SUGGESTION sentences, hence we can conclude that the information about sentiments is not much useful for our classification problem.\nDiscovering Clusters within Sentence Classes\nAfter identifying sentences in each class, we can now answer question (1) in Section SECREF1 . From 12742 sentences predicted to have label STRENGTH, we extract nouns that indicate the actual strength, and cluster them using a simple clustering algorithm which uses the cosine similarity between word embeddings of these nouns. We repeat this for the 9160 sentences with predicted label WEAKNESS or SUGGESTION as a single class. Tables TABREF15 and TABREF16 show a few representative clusters in strengths and in weaknesses, respectively. We also explored clustering 12742 STRENGTH sentences directly using CLUTO BIBREF19 and Carrot2 Lingo BIBREF20 clustering algorithms. Carrot2 Lingo discovered 167 clusters and also assigned labels to these clusters. We then generated 167 clusters using CLUTO as well. CLUTO does not generate cluster labels automatically, hence we used 5 most frequent words within the cluster as its labels. Table TABREF19 shows the largest 5 clusters by both the algorithms. It was observed that the clusters created by CLUTO were more meaningful and informative as compared to those by Carrot2 Lingo. Also, it was observed that there is some correspondence between noun clusters and sentence clusters. E.g. the nouns cluster motivation expertise knowledge talent skill (Table TABREF15 ) corresponds to the CLUTO sentence cluster skill customer management knowledge team (Table TABREF19 ). But overall, users found the nouns clusters to be more meaningful than the sentence clusters.\nPA along Attributes\nIn many organizations, PA is done from a predefined set of perspectives, which we call attributes. Each attribute covers one specific aspect of the work done by the employees. This has the advantage that we can easily compare the performance of any two employees (or groups of employees) along any given attribute. We can correlate various performance attributes and find dependencies among them. We can also cluster employees in the workforce using their supervisor ratings for each attribute to discover interesting insights into the workforce. The HR managers in the organization considered in this paper have defined 15 attributes (Table TABREF20 ). Each attribute is essentially a work item or work category described at an abstract level. For example, FUNCTIONAL_EXCELLENCE covers any tasks, goals or activities related to the software engineering life-cycle (e.g., requirements analysis, design, coding, testing etc.) as well as technologies such as databases, web services and GUI.\nIn the example in Section SECREF4 , the first sentence (which has class STRENGTH) can be mapped to two attributes: FUNCTIONAL_EXCELLENCE and BUILDING_EFFECTIVE_TEAMS. Similarly, the third sentence (which has class WEAKNESS) can be mapped to the attribute INTERPERSONAL_EFFECTIVENESS and so forth. Thus, in order to answer the second question in Section SECREF1 , we need to map each sentence in each of the 3 classes to zero, one, two or more attributes, which is a multi-class multi-label classification problem.\nWe manually tagged the same 2000 sentences in Dataset D1 with attributes, where each sentence may get 0, 1, 2, etc. up to 15 class labels (this is dataset D2). This labelled dataset contained 749, 206, 289, 207, 91, 223, 191, 144, 103, 80, 82, 42, 29, 15, 24 sentences having the class labels listed in Table TABREF20 in the same order. The number of sentences having 0, 1, 2, or more than 2 attributes are: 321, 1070, 470 and 139 respectively. We trained several multi-class multi-label classifiers on this dataset. Table TABREF21 shows the results of 5-fold cross-validation experiments on dataset D2.\nPrecision, Recall and F-measure for this multi-label classification are computed using a strategy similar to the one described in BIBREF21 . Let INLINEFORM0 be the set of predicted labels and INLINEFORM1 be the set of actual labels for the INLINEFORM2 instance. Precision and recall for this instance are computed as follows: INLINEFORM3\nIt can be observed that INLINEFORM0 would be undefined if INLINEFORM1 is empty and similarly INLINEFORM2 would be undefined when INLINEFORM3 is empty. Hence, overall precision and recall are computed by averaging over all the instances except where they are undefined. Instance-level F-measure can not be computed for instances where either precision or recall are undefined. Therefore, overall F-measure is computed using the overall precision and recall.\nSummarization of Peer Feedback using ILP\nThe PA system includes a set of peer feedback comments for each employee. To answer the third question in Section SECREF1 , we need to create a summary of all the peer feedback comments about a given employee. As an example, following are the feedback comments from 5 peers of an employee.\nThe individual sentences in the comments written by each peer are first identified and then POS tags are assigned to each sentence. We hypothesize that a good summary of these multiple comments can be constructed by identifying a set of important text fragments or phrases. Initially, a set of candidate phrases is extracted from these comments and a subset of these candidate phrases is chosen as the final summary, using Integer Linear Programming (ILP). The details of the ILP formulation are shown in Table TABREF36 . As an example, following is the summary generated for the above 5 peer comments.\nhumble nature, effective communication, technical expertise, always supportive, vast knowledge\nFollowing rules are used to identify candidate phrases:\nVarious parameters are used to evaluate a candidate phrase for its importance. A candidate phrase is more important:\nA complete list of parameters is described in detail in Table TABREF36 .\nThere is a trivial constraint INLINEFORM0 which makes sure that only INLINEFORM1 out of INLINEFORM2 candidate phrases are chosen. A suitable value of INLINEFORM3 is used for each employee depending on number of candidate phrases identified across all peers (see Algorithm SECREF6 ). Another set of constraints ( INLINEFORM4 to INLINEFORM5 ) make sure that at least one phrase is selected for each of the leadership attributes. The constraint INLINEFORM6 makes sure that multiple phrases sharing the same headword are not chosen at a time. Also, single word candidate phrases are chosen only if they are adjectives or nouns with lexical category noun.attribute. This is imposed by the constraint INLINEFORM7 . It is important to note that all the constraints except INLINEFORM8 are soft constraints, i.e. there may be feasible solutions which do not satisfy some of these constraints. But each constraint which is not satisfied, results in a penalty through the use of slack variables. These constraints are described in detail in Table TABREF36 .\nThe objective function maximizes the total importance score of the selected candidate phrases. At the same time, it also minimizes the sum of all slack variables so that the minimum number of constraints are broken.\nINLINEFORM0 : No. of candidate phrases INLINEFORM1 : No. of phrases to select as part of summary\nINLINEFORM0 INLINEFORM1 INLINEFORM2 INLINEFORM3 INLINEFORM4 INLINEFORM5 INLINEFORM6 INLINEFORM7 INLINEFORM8\nINLINEFORM0 and INLINEFORM1 INLINEFORM2 INLINEFORM3 INLINEFORM4 INLINEFORM5 INLINEFORM6\nINLINEFORM0 (For determining number of phrases to select to include in summary)\nEvaluation of auto-generated summaries\nWe considered a dataset of 100 employees, where for each employee multiple peer comments were recorded. Also, for each employee, a manual summary was generated by an HR personnel. The summaries generated by our ILP-based approach were compared with the corresponding manual summaries using the ROUGE BIBREF22 unigram score. For comparing performance of our ILP-based summarization algorithm, we explored a few summarization algorithms provided by the Sumy package. A common parameter which is required by all these algorithms is number of sentences keep in the final summary. ILP-based summarization requires a similar parameter K, which is automatically decided based on number of total candidate phrases. Assuming a sentence is equivalent to roughly 3 phrases, for Sumy algorithms, we set number of sentences parameter to the ceiling of K/3. Table TABREF51 shows average and standard deviation of ROUGE unigram f1 scores for each algorithm, over the 100 summaries. The performance of ILP-based summarization is comparable with the other algorithms, as the two sample t-test does not show statistically significant difference. Also, human evaluators preferred phrase-based summary generated by our approach to the other sentence-based summaries.\nConclusions and Further Work\nIn this paper, we presented an analysis of the text generated in Performance Appraisal (PA) process in a large multi-national IT company. We performed sentence classification to identify strengths, weaknesses and suggestions for improvements found in the supervisor assessments and then used clustering to discover broad categories among them. As this is non-topical classification, we found that SVM with ADWS kernel BIBREF18 produced the best results. We also used multi-class multi-label classification techniques to match supervisor assessments to predefined broad perspectives on performance. Logistic Regression classifier was observed to produce the best results for this topical classification. Finally, we proposed an ILP-based summarization technique to produce a summary of peer feedback comments for a given employee and compared it with manual summaries.\nThe PA process also generates much structured data, such as supervisor ratings. It is an interesting problem to compare and combine the insights from discovered from structured data and unstructured text. Also, we are planning to automatically discover any additional performance attributes to the list of 15 attributes currently used by HR.\n\n Answer the question based on the above article as concisely as you can, using a single phrase or sentence if possible.

The PA process enables an organization to periodically measure and evaluate every employee's performance. It also provides a mechanism to link the goals established by the organization to its each employee's day-to-day activities and performance. Design and analysis of PA processes is a lively area of research within the HR community BIBREF0 , BIBREF1 , BIBREF2 , BIBREF3 .\nThe PA process in any modern organization is nowadays implemented and tracked through an IT system (the PA system) that records the interactions that happen in various steps. Availability of this data in a computer-readable database opens up opportunities to analyze it using automated statistical, data-mining and text-mining techniques, to generate novel and actionable insights / patterns and to help in improving the quality and effectiveness of the PA process BIBREF4 , BIBREF5 , BIBREF6 . Automated analysis of large-scale PA data is now facilitated by technological and algorithmic advances, and is becoming essential for large organizations containing thousands of geographically distributed employees handling a wide variety of roles and tasks.\nA typical PA process involves purposeful multi-step multi-modal communication between employees, their supervisors and their peers. In most PA processes, the communication includes the following steps: (i) in self-appraisal, an employee records his/her achievements, activities, tasks handled etc.; (ii) in supervisor assessment, the supervisor provides the criticism, evaluation and suggestions for improvement of performance etc.; and (iii) in peer feedback (aka INLINEFORM0 view), the peers of the employee provide their feedback. There are several business questions that managers are interested in. Examples:\nIn this paper, we develop text mining techniques that can automatically produce answers to these questions. Since the intended users are HR executives, ideally, the techniques should work with minimum training data and experimentation with parameter setting. These techniques have been implemented and are being used in a PA system in a large multi-national IT company.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section SECREF2 summarizes related work. Section SECREF3 summarizes the PA dataset used in this paper. Section SECREF4 applies sentence classification algorithms to automatically discover three important classes of sentences in the PA corpus viz., sentences that discuss strengths, weaknesses of employees and contain suggestions for improving her performance. Section SECREF5 considers the problem of mapping the actual targets mentioned in strengths, weaknesses and suggestions to a fixed set of attributes. In Section SECREF6 , we discuss how the feedback from peers for a particular employee can be summarized. In Section SECREF7 we draw conclusions and identify some further work.\nRelated Work\nWe first review some work related to sentence classification. Semantically classifying sentences (based on the sentence's purpose) is a much harder task, and is gaining increasing attention from linguists and NLP researchers. McKnight and Srinivasan BIBREF7 and Yamamoto and Takagi BIBREF8 used SVM to classify sentences in biomedical abstracts into classes such as INTRODUCTION, BACKGROUND, PURPOSE, METHOD, RESULT, CONCLUSION. Cohen et al. BIBREF9 applied SVM and other techniques to learn classifiers for sentences in emails into classes, which are speech acts defined by a verb-noun pair, with verbs such as request, propose, amend, commit, deliver and nouns such as meeting, document, committee; see also BIBREF10 . Khoo et al. BIBREF11 uses various classifiers to classify sentences in emails into classes such as APOLOGY, INSTRUCTION, QUESTION, REQUEST, SALUTATION, STATEMENT, SUGGESTION, THANKING etc. Qadir and Riloff BIBREF12 proposes several filters and classifiers to classify sentences on message boards (community QA systems) into 4 speech acts: COMMISSIVE (speaker commits to a future action), DIRECTIVE (speaker expects listener to take some action), EXPRESSIVE (speaker expresses his or her psychological state to the listener), REPRESENTATIVE (represents the speaker's belief of something). Hachey and Grover BIBREF13 used SVM and maximum entropy classifiers to classify sentences in legal documents into classes such as FACT, PROCEEDINGS, BACKGROUND, FRAMING, DISPOSAL; see also BIBREF14 . Deshpande et al. BIBREF15 proposes unsupervised linguistic patterns to classify sentences into classes SUGGESTION, COMPLAINT.\nThere is much work on a closely related problem viz., classifying sentences in dialogues through dialogue-specific categories called dialogue acts BIBREF16 , which we will not review here. Just as one example, Cotterill BIBREF17 classifies questions in emails into the dialogue acts of YES_NO_QUESTION, WH_QUESTION, ACTION_REQUEST, RHETORICAL, MULTIPLE_CHOICE etc.\nWe could not find much work related to mining of performance appraisals data. Pawar et al. BIBREF18 uses kernel-based classification to classify sentences in both performance appraisal text and product reviews into classes SUGGESTION, APPRECIATION, COMPLAINT. Apte et al. BIBREF6 provides two algorithms for matching the descriptions of goals or tasks assigned to employees to a standard template of model goals. One algorithm is based on the co-training framework and uses goal descriptions and self-appraisal comments as two separate perspectives. The second approach uses semantic similarity under a weak supervision framework. Ramrakhiyani et al. BIBREF5 proposes label propagation algorithms to discover aspects in supervisor assessments in performance appraisals, where an aspect is modelled as a verb-noun pair (e.g. conduct training, improve coding).\nDataset\nIn this paper, we used the supervisor assessment and peer feedback text produced during the performance appraisal of 4528 employees in a large multi-national IT company. The corpus of supervisor assessment has 26972 sentences. The summary statistics about the number of words in a sentence is: min:4 max:217 average:15.5 STDEV:9.2 Q1:9 Q2:14 Q3:19.\nSentence Classification\nThe PA corpus contains several classes of sentences that are of interest. In this paper, we focus on three important classes of sentences viz., sentences that discuss strengths (class STRENGTH), weaknesses of employees (class WEAKNESS) and suggestions for improving her performance (class SUGGESTION). The strengths or weaknesses are mostly about the performance in work carried out, but sometimes they can be about the working style or other personal qualities. The classes WEAKNESS and SUGGESTION are somewhat overlapping; e.g., a suggestion may address a perceived weakness. Following are two example sentences in each class.\nSTRENGTH:\nWEAKNESS:\nSUGGESTION:\nSeveral linguistic aspects of these classes of sentences are apparent. The subject is implicit in many sentences. The strengths are often mentioned as either noun phrases (NP) with positive adjectives (Excellent technology leadership) or positive nouns (engineering strength) or through verbs with positive polarity (dedicated) or as verb phrases containing positive adjectives (delivers innovative solutions). Similarly for weaknesses, where negation is more frequently used (presentations are not his forte), or alternatively, the polarities of verbs (avoid) or adjectives (poor) tend to be negative. However, sometimes the form of both the strengths and weaknesses is the same, typically a stand-alone sentiment-neutral NP, making it difficult to distinguish between them; e.g., adherence to timing or timely closure. Suggestions often have an imperative mood and contain secondary verbs such as need to, should, has to. Suggestions are sometimes expressed using comparatives (better process compliance). We built a simple set of patterns for each of the 3 classes on the POS-tagged form of the sentences. We use each set of these patterns as an unsupervised sentence classifier for that class. If a particular sentence matched with patterns for multiple classes, then we have simple tie-breaking rules for picking the final class. The pattern for the STRENGTH class looks for the presence of positive words / phrases like takes ownership, excellent, hard working, commitment, etc. Similarly, the pattern for the WEAKNESS class looks for the presence of negative words / phrases like lacking, diffident, slow learner, less focused, etc. The SUGGESTION pattern not only looks for keywords like should, needs to but also for POS based pattern like \u201ca verb in the base form (VB) in the beginning of a sentence\u201d.\nWe randomly selected 2000 sentences from the supervisor assessment corpus and manually tagged them (dataset D1). This labelled dataset contained 705, 103, 822 and 370 sentences having the class labels STRENGTH, WEAKNESS, SUGGESTION or OTHER respectively. We trained several multi-class classifiers on this dataset. Table TABREF10 shows the results of 5-fold cross-validation experiments on dataset D1. For the first 5 classifiers, we used their implementation from the SciKit Learn library in Python (scikit-learn.org). The features used for these classifiers were simply the sentence words along with their frequencies. For the last 2 classifiers (in Table TABREF10 ), we used our own implementation. The overall accuracy for a classifier is defined as INLINEFORM0 , where the denominator is 2000 for dataset D1. Note that the pattern-based approach is unsupervised i.e., it did not use any training data. Hence, the results shown for it are for the entire dataset and not based on cross-validation.\nComparison with Sentiment Analyzer\nWe also explored whether a sentiment analyzer can be used as a baseline for identifying the class labels STRENGTH and WEAKNESS. We used an implementation of sentiment analyzer from TextBlob to get a polarity score for each sentence. Table TABREF13 shows the distribution of positive, negative and neutral sentiments across the 3 class labels STRENGTH, WEAKNESS and SUGGESTION. It can be observed that distribution of positive and negative sentiments is almost similar in STRENGTH as well as SUGGESTION sentences, hence we can conclude that the information about sentiments is not much useful for our classification problem.\nDiscovering Clusters within Sentence Classes\nAfter identifying sentences in each class, we can now answer question (1) in Section SECREF1 . From 12742 sentences predicted to have label STRENGTH, we extract nouns that indicate the actual strength, and cluster them using a simple clustering algorithm which uses the cosine similarity between word embeddings of these nouns. We repeat this for the 9160 sentences with predicted label WEAKNESS or SUGGESTION as a single class. Tables TABREF15 and TABREF16 show a few representative clusters in strengths and in weaknesses, respectively. We also explored clustering 12742 STRENGTH sentences directly using CLUTO BIBREF19 and Carrot2 Lingo BIBREF20 clustering algorithms. Carrot2 Lingo discovered 167 clusters and also assigned labels to these clusters. We then generated 167 clusters using CLUTO as well. CLUTO does not generate cluster labels automatically, hence we used 5 most frequent words within the cluster as its labels. Table TABREF19 shows the largest 5 clusters by both the algorithms. It was observed that the clusters created by CLUTO were more meaningful and informative as compared to those by Carrot2 Lingo. Also, it was observed that there is some correspondence between noun clusters and sentence clusters. E.g. the nouns cluster motivation expertise knowledge talent skill (Table TABREF15 ) corresponds to the CLUTO sentence cluster skill customer management knowledge team (Table TABREF19 ). But overall, users found the nouns clusters to be more meaningful than the sentence clusters.\nPA along Attributes\nIn many organizations, PA is done from a predefined set of perspectives, which we call attributes. Each attribute covers one specific aspect of the work done by the employees. This has the advantage that we can easily compare the performance of any two employees (or groups of employees) along any given attribute. We can correlate various performance attributes and find dependencies among them. We can also cluster employees in the workforce using their supervisor ratings for each attribute to discover interesting insights into the workforce. The HR managers in the organization considered in this paper have defined 15 attributes (Table TABREF20 ). Each attribute is essentially a work item or work category described at an abstract level. For example, FUNCTIONAL_EXCELLENCE covers any tasks, goals or activities related to the software engineering life-cycle (e.g., requirements analysis, design, coding, testing etc.) as well as technologies such as databases, web services and GUI.\nIn the example in Section SECREF4 , the first sentence (which has class STRENGTH) can be mapped to two attributes: FUNCTIONAL_EXCELLENCE and BUILDING_EFFECTIVE_TEAMS. Similarly, the third sentence (which has class WEAKNESS) can be mapped to the attribute INTERPERSONAL_EFFECTIVENESS and so forth. Thus, in order to answer the second question in Section SECREF1 , we need to map each sentence in each of the 3 classes to zero, one, two or more attributes, which is a multi-class multi-label classification problem.\nWe manually tagged the same 2000 sentences in Dataset D1 with attributes, where each sentence may get 0, 1, 2, etc. up to 15 class labels (this is dataset D2). This labelled dataset contained 749, 206, 289, 207, 91, 223, 191, 144, 103, 80, 82, 42, 29, 15, 24 sentences having the class labels listed in Table TABREF20 in the same order. The number of sentences having 0, 1, 2, or more than 2 attributes are: 321, 1070, 470 and 139 respectively. We trained several multi-class multi-label classifiers on this dataset. Table TABREF21 shows the results of 5-fold cross-validation experiments on dataset D2.\nPrecision, Recall and F-measure for this multi-label classification are computed using a strategy similar to the one described in BIBREF21 . Let INLINEFORM0 be the set of predicted labels and INLINEFORM1 be the set of actual labels for the INLINEFORM2 instance. Precision and recall for this instance are computed as follows: INLINEFORM3\nIt can be observed that INLINEFORM0 would be undefined if INLINEFORM1 is empty and similarly INLINEFORM2 would be undefined when INLINEFORM3 is empty. Hence, overall precision and recall are computed by averaging over all the instances except where they are undefined. Instance-level F-measure can not be computed for instances where either precision or recall are undefined. Therefore, overall F-measure is computed using the overall precision and recall.\nSummarization of Peer Feedback using ILP\nThe PA system includes a set of peer feedback comments for each employee. To answer the third question in Section SECREF1 , we need to create a summary of all the peer feedback comments about a given employee. As an example, following are the feedback comments from 5 peers of an employee.\nThe individual sentences in the comments written by each peer are first identified and then POS tags are assigned to each sentence. We hypothesize that a good summary of these multiple comments can be constructed by identifying a set of important text fragments or phrases. Initially, a set of candidate phrases is extracted from these comments and a subset of these candidate phrases is chosen as the final summary, using Integer Linear Programming (ILP). The details of the ILP formulation are shown in Table TABREF36 . As an example, following is the summary generated for the above 5 peer comments.\nhumble nature, effective communication, technical expertise, always supportive, vast knowledge\nFollowing rules are used to identify candidate phrases:\nVarious parameters are used to evaluate a candidate phrase for its importance. A candidate phrase is more important:\nA complete list of parameters is described in detail in Table TABREF36 .\nThere is a trivial constraint INLINEFORM0 which makes sure that only INLINEFORM1 out of INLINEFORM2 candidate phrases are chosen. A suitable value of INLINEFORM3 is used for each employee depending on number of candidate phrases identified across all peers (see Algorithm SECREF6 ). Another set of constraints ( INLINEFORM4 to INLINEFORM5 ) make sure that at least one phrase is selected for each of the leadership attributes. The constraint INLINEFORM6 makes sure that multiple phrases sharing the same headword are not chosen at a time. Also, single word candidate phrases are chosen only if they are adjectives or nouns with lexical category noun.attribute. This is imposed by the constraint INLINEFORM7 . It is important to note that all the constraints except INLINEFORM8 are soft constraints, i.e. there may be feasible solutions which do not satisfy some of these constraints. But each constraint which is not satisfied, results in a penalty through the use of slack variables. These constraints are described in detail in Table TABREF36 .\nThe objective function maximizes the total importance score of the selected candidate phrases. At the same time, it also minimizes the sum of all slack variables so that the minimum number of constraints are broken.\nINLINEFORM0 : No. of candidate phrases INLINEFORM1 : No. of phrases to select as part of summary\nINLINEFORM0 INLINEFORM1 INLINEFORM2 INLINEFORM3 INLINEFORM4 INLINEFORM5 INLINEFORM6 INLINEFORM7 INLINEFORM8\nINLINEFORM0 and INLINEFORM1 INLINEFORM2 INLINEFORM3 INLINEFORM4 INLINEFORM5 INLINEFORM6\nINLINEFORM0 (For determining number of phrases to select to include in summary)\nEvaluation of auto-generated summaries\nWe considered a dataset of 100 employees, where for each employee multiple peer comments were recorded.

Assuming a sentence is equivalent to roughly 3 phrases, for Sumy algorithms, we set number of sentences parameter to the ceiling of K/3. Table TABREF51 shows average and standard deviation of ROUGE unigram f1 scores for each algorithm, over the 100 summaries. The performance of ILP-based summarization is comparable with the other algorithms, as the two sample t-test does not show statistically significant difference. Also, human evaluators preferred phrase-based summary generated by our approach to the other sentence-based summaries.\nConclusions and Further Work\nIn this paper, we presented an analysis of the text generated in Performance Appraisal (PA) process in a large multi-national IT company.

Do not provide any explanation.\n\nArticle: Introduction\nPrivacy policies are the documents which disclose the ways in which a company gathers, uses, shares and manages a user's data. As legal documents, they function using the principle of notice and choice BIBREF0, where companies post their policies, and theoretically, users read the policies and decide to use a company's products or services only if they find the conditions outlined in its privacy policy acceptable. Many legal jurisdictions around the world accept this framework, including the United States and the European Union BIBREF1, BIBREF2. However, the legitimacy of this framework depends upon users actually reading and understanding privacy policies to determine whether company practices are acceptable to them BIBREF3. In practice this is seldom the case BIBREF4, BIBREF5, BIBREF6, BIBREF7, BIBREF8, BIBREF9, BIBREF10. This is further complicated by the highly individual and nuanced compromises that users are willing to make with their data BIBREF11, discouraging a `one-size-fits-all' approach to notice of data practices in privacy documents.\nWith devices constantly monitoring our environment, including our personal space and our bodies, lack of awareness of how our data is being used easily leads to problematic situations where users are outraged by information misuse, but companies insist that users have consented. The discovery of increasingly egregious uses of data by companies, such as the scandals involving Facebook and Cambridge Analytica BIBREF12, have further brought public attention to the privacy concerns of the internet and ubiquitous computing. This makes privacy a well-motivated application domain for NLP researchers, where advances in enabling users to quickly identify the privacy issues most salient to them can potentially have large real-world impact.\n[1]https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gotokeep.keep.intl [2]https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.viber.voip [3]A question might not have any supporting evidence for an answer within the privacy policy.\nMotivated by this need, we contribute PrivacyQA, a corpus consisting of 1750 questions about the contents of privacy policies, paired with over 3500 expert annotations. The goal of this effort is to kickstart the development of question-answering methods for this domain, to address the (unrealistic) expectation that a large population should be reading many policies per day. In doing so, we identify several understudied challenges to our ability to answer these questions, with broad implications for systems seeking to serve users' information-seeking intent. By releasing this resource, we hope to provide an impetus to develop systems capable of language understanding in this increasingly important domain.\nRelated Work\nPrior work has aimed to make privacy policies easier to understand. Prescriptive approaches towards communicating privacy information BIBREF21, BIBREF22, BIBREF23 have not been widely adopted by industry. Recently, there have been significant research effort devoted to understanding privacy policies by leveraging NLP techniques BIBREF24, BIBREF25, BIBREF26, BIBREF27, BIBREF28, especially by identifying specific data practices within a privacy policy. We adopt a personalized approach to understanding privacy policies, that allows users to query a document and selectively explore content salient to them. Most similar is the PolisisQA corpus BIBREF29, which examines questions users ask corporations on Twitter. Our approach differs in several ways: 1) The PrivacyQA dataset is larger, containing 10x as many questions and answers. 2) Answers are formulated by domain experts with legal training. 3) PrivacyQA includes diverse question types, including unanswerable and subjective questions.\nOur work is also related to reading comprehension in the open domain, which is frequently based upon Wikipedia passages BIBREF16, BIBREF17, BIBREF15, BIBREF30 and news articles BIBREF20, BIBREF31, BIBREF32. Table.TABREF4 presents the desirable attributes our dataset shares with past approaches. This work is also tied into research in applying NLP approaches to legal documents BIBREF33, BIBREF34, BIBREF35, BIBREF36, BIBREF37, BIBREF38, BIBREF39. While privacy policies have legal implications, their intended audience consists of the general public rather than individuals with legal expertise. This arrangement is problematic because the entities that write privacy policies often have different goals than the audience. feng2015applying, tan-EtAl:2016:P16-1 examine question answering in the insurance domain, another specialized domain similar to privacy, where the intended audience is the general public.\nData Collection\nWe describe the data collection methodology used to construct PrivacyQA. With the goal of achieving broad coverage across application types, we collect privacy policies from 35 mobile applications representing a number of different categories in the Google Play Store. One of our goals is to include both policies from well-known applications, which are likely to have carefully-constructed privacy policies, and lesser-known applications with smaller install bases, whose policies might be considerably less sophisticated. Thus, setting 5 million installs as a threshold, we ensure each category includes applications with installs on both sides of this threshold. All policies included in the corpus are in English, and were collected before April 1, 2018, predating many companies' GDPR-focused BIBREF41 updates. We leave it to future studies BIBREF42 to look at the impact of the GDPR (e.g., to what extent GDPR requirements contribute to making it possible to provide users with more informative answers, and to what extent their disclosures continue to omit issues that matter to users).\nData Collection ::: Crowdsourced Question Elicitation\nThe intended audience for privacy policies consists of the general public. This informs the decision to elicit questions from crowdworkers on the contents of privacy policies. We choose not to show the contents of privacy policies to crowdworkers, a procedure motivated by a desire to avoid inadvertent biases BIBREF43, BIBREF44, BIBREF45, BIBREF46, BIBREF47, and encourage crowdworkers to ask a variety of questions beyond only asking questions based on practices described in the document.\nInstead, crowdworkers are presented with public information about a mobile application available on the Google Play Store including its name, description and navigable screenshots. Figure FIGREF9 shows an example of our user interface. Crowdworkers are asked to imagine they have access to a trusted third-party privacy assistant, to whom they can ask any privacy question about a given mobile application. We use the Amazon Mechanical Turk platform and recruit crowdworkers who have been conferred \u201cmaster\u201d status and are located within the United States of America. Turkers are asked to provide five questions per mobile application, and are paid $2 per assignment, taking ~eight minutes to complete the task.\nData Collection ::: Answer Selection\nTo identify legally sound answers, we recruit seven experts with legal training to construct answers to Turker questions. Experts identify relevant evidence within the privacy policy, as well as provide meta-annotation on the question's relevance, subjectivity, OPP-115 category BIBREF49, and how likely any privacy policy is to contain the answer to the question asked.\nData Collection ::: Analysis\nTable.TABREF17 presents aggregate statistics of the PrivacyQA dataset. 1750 questions are posed to our imaginary privacy assistant over 35 mobile applications and their associated privacy documents. As an initial step, we formulate the problem of answering user questions as an extractive sentence selection task, ignoring for now background knowledge, statistical data and legal expertise that could otherwise be brought to bear. The dataset is partitioned into a training set featuring 27 mobile applications and 1350 questions, and a test set consisting of 400 questions over 8 policy documents. This ensures that documents in training and test splits are mutually exclusive. Every question is answered by at least one expert. In addition, in order to estimate annotation reliability and provide for better evaluation, every question in the test set is answered by at least two additional experts.\nTable TABREF14 describes the distribution over first words of questions posed by crowdworkers. We also observe low redundancy in the questions posed by crowdworkers over each policy, with each policy receiving ~49.94 unique questions despite crowdworkers independently posing questions. Questions are on average 8.4 words long. As declining to answer a question can be a legally sound response but is seldom practically useful, answers to questions where a minority of experts abstain to answer are filtered from the dataset. Privacy policies are ~3000 words long on average. The answers to the question asked by the users typically have ~100 words of evidence in the privacy policy document.\nData Collection ::: Analysis ::: Categories of Questions\nQuestions are organized under nine categories from the OPP-115 Corpus annotation scheme BIBREF49:\nFirst Party Collection/Use: What, why and how information is collected by the service provider\nThird Party Sharing/Collection: What, why and how information shared with or collected by third parties\nData Security: Protection measures for user information\nData Retention: How long user information will be stored\nUser Choice/Control: Control options available to users\nUser Access, Edit and Deletion: If/how users can access, edit or delete information\nPolicy Change: Informing users if policy information has been changed\nInternational and Specific Audiences: Practices pertaining to a specific group of users\nOther: General text, contact information or practices not covered by other categories.\nFor each question, domain experts indicate one or more relevant OPP-115 categories. We mark a category as relevant to a question if it is identified as such by at least two annotators. If no such category exists, the category is marked as `Other' if atleast one annotator has identified the `Other' category to be relevant. If neither of these conditions is satisfied, we label the question as having no agreement. The distribution of questions in the corpus across OPP-115 categories is as shown in Table.TABREF16. First party and third party related questions are the largest categories, forming nearly 66.4% of all questions asked to the privacy assistant.\nData Collection ::: Analysis ::: Answer Validation\nWhen do experts disagree? We would like to analyze the reasons for potential disagreement on the annotation task, to ensure disagreements arise due to valid differences in opinion rather than lack of adequate specification in annotation guidelines. It is important to note that the annotators are experts rather than crowdworkers. Accordingly, their judgements can be considered valid, legally-informed opinions even when their perspectives differ. For the sake of this question we randomly sample 100 instances in the test data and analyze them for likely reasons for disagreements. We consider a disagreement to have occurred when more than one expert does not agree with the majority consensus. By disagreement we mean there is no overlap between the text identified as relevant by one expert and another.\nWe find that the annotators agree on the answer for 74% of the questions, even if the supporting evidence they identify is not identical i.e full overlap. They disagree on the remaining 26%. Sources of apparent disagreement correspond to situations when different experts: have differing interpretations of question intent (11%) (for example, when a user asks 'who can contact me through the app', the questions admits multiple interpretations, including seeking information about the features of the app, asking about first party collection/use of data or asking about third party collection/use of data), identify different sources of evidence for questions that ask if a practice is performed or not (4%), have differing interpretations of policy content (3%), identify a partial answer to a question in the privacy policy (2%) (for example, when the user asks `who is allowed to use the app' a majority of our annotators decline to answer, but the remaining annotators highlight partial evidence in the privacy policy which states that children under the age of 13 are not allowed to use the app), and other legitimate sources of disagreement (6%) which include personal subjective views of the annotators (for example, when the user asks `is my DNA information used in any way other than what is specified', some experts consider the boilerplate text of the privacy policy which states that it abides to practices described in the policy document as sufficient evidence to answer this question, whereas others do not).\nExperimental Setup\nWe evaluate the ability of machine learning methods to identify relevant evidence for questions in the privacy domain. We establish baselines for the subtask of deciding on the answerability (\u00a7SECREF33) of a question, as well as the overall task of identifying evidence for questions from policies (\u00a7SECREF37). We describe aspects of the question that can render it unanswerable within the privacy domain (\u00a7SECREF41).\nExperimental Setup ::: Answerability Identification Baselines\nWe define answerability identification as a binary classification task, evaluating model ability to predict if a question can be answered, given a question in isolation. This can serve as a prior for downstream question-answering. We describe three baselines on the answerability task, and find they considerably improve performance over a majority-class baseline.\nSVM: We define 3 sets of features to characterize each question. The first is a simple bag-of-words set of features over the question (SVM-BOW), the second is bag-of-words features of the question as well as length of the question in words (SVM-BOW + LEN), and lastly we extract bag-of-words features, length of the question in words as well as part-of-speech tags for the question (SVM-BOW + LEN + POS). This results in vectors of 200, 201 and 228 dimensions respectively, which are provided to an SVM with a linear kernel.\nCNN: We utilize a CNN neural encoder for answerability prediction. We use GloVe word embeddings BIBREF50, and a filter size of 5 with 64 filters to encode questions.\nBERT: BERT BIBREF51 is a bidirectional transformer-based language-model BIBREF52. We fine-tune BERT-base on our binary answerability identification task with a learning rate of 2e-5 for 3 epochs, with a maximum sequence length of 128.\nExperimental Setup ::: Privacy Question Answering\nOur goal is to identify evidence within a privacy policy for questions asked by a user. This is framed as an answer sentence selection task, where models identify a set of evidence sentences from all candidate sentences in each policy.\nExperimental Setup ::: Privacy Question Answering ::: Evaluation Metric\nOur evaluation metric for answer-sentence selection is sentence-level F1, implemented similar to BIBREF30, BIBREF16. Precision and recall are implemented by measuring the overlap between predicted sentences and sets of gold-reference sentences. We report the average of the maximum F1 from each n$-$1 subset, in relation to the heldout reference.\nExperimental Setup ::: Privacy Question Answering ::: Baselines\nWe describe baselines on this task, including a human performance baseline.\nNo-Answer Baseline (NA) : Most of the questions we receive are difficult to answer in a legally-sound way on the basis of information present in the privacy policy. We establish a simple baseline to quantify the effect of identifying every question as unanswerable.\nWord Count Baseline : To quantify the effect of using simple lexical matching to answer the questions, we retrieve the top candidate policy sentences for each question using a word count baseline BIBREF53, which counts the number of question words that also appear in a sentence. We include the top 2, 3 and 5 candidates as baselines.\nBERT: We implement two BERT-based baselines BIBREF51 for evidence identification. First, we train BERT on each query-policy sentence pair as a binary classification task to identify if the sentence is evidence for the question or not (Bert). We also experiment with a two-stage classifier, where we separately train the model on questions only to predict answerability. At inference time, if the answerable classifier predicts the question is answerable, the evidence identification classifier produces a set of candidate sentences (Bert + Unanswerable).\nHuman Performance: We pick each reference answer provided by an annotator, and compute the F1 with respect to the remaining references, as described in section 4.2.1. Each reference answer is treated as the prediction, and the remaining n-1 answers are treated as the gold reference. The average of the maximum F1 across all reference answers is computed as the human baseline.\nResults and Discussion\nThe results of the answerability baselines are presented in Table TABREF31, and on answer sentence selection in Table TABREF32. We observe that bert exhibits the best performance on a binary answerability identification task. However, most baselines considerably exceed the performance of a majority-class baseline. This suggests considerable information in the question, indicating it's possible answerability within this domain.\nTable.TABREF32 describes the performance of our baselines on the answer sentence selection task. The No-answer (NA) baseline performs at 28 F1, providing a lower bound on performance at this task. We observe that our best-performing baseline, Bert + Unanswerable achieves an F1 of 39.8. This suggest that bert is capable of making some progress towards answering questions in this difficult domain, while still leaving considerable headroom for improvement to reach human performance. Bert + Unanswerable performance suggests that incorporating information about answerability can help in this difficult domain. We examine this challenging phenomena of unanswerability further in Section .\nResults and Discussion ::: Error Analysis\nDisagreements are analyzed based on the OPP-115 categories of each question (Table.TABREF34). We compare our best performing BERT variant against the NA model and human performance. We observe significant room for improvement across all categories of questions but especially for first party, third party and data retention categories.\nWe analyze the performance of our strongest BERT variant, to identify classes of errors and directions for future improvement (Table.8). We observe that a majority of answerability mistakes made by the BERT model are questions which are in fact answerable, but are identified as unanswerable by BERT. We observe that BERT makes 124 such mistakes on the test set. We collect expert judgments on relevance, subjectivity , silence and information about how likely the question is to be answered from the privacy policy from our experts. We find that most of these mistakes are relevant questions. However many of them were identified as subjective by the annotators, and at least one annotator marked 19 of these questions as having no answer within the privacy policy. However, only 6 of these questions were unexpected or do not usually have an answer in privacy policies. These findings suggest that a more nuanced understanding of answerability might help improve model performance in his challenging domain.\nResults and Discussion ::: What makes Questions Unanswerable?\nWe further ask legal experts to identify potential causes of unanswerability of questions. This analysis has considerable implications. While past work BIBREF17 has treated unanswerable questions as homogeneous, a question answering system might wish to have different treatments for different categories of `unanswerable' questions. The following factors were identified to play a role in unanswerability:\nIncomprehensibility: If a question is incomprehensible to the extent that its meaning is not intelligible.\nRelevance: Is this question in the scope of what could be answered by reading the privacy policy.\nIll-formedness: Is this question ambiguous or vague. An ambiguous statement will typically contain expressions that can refer to multiple potential explanations, whereas a vague statement carries a concept with an unclear or soft definition.\nSilence: Other policies answer this type of question but this one does not.\nAtypicality: The question is of a nature such that it is unlikely for any policy policy to have an answer to the question.\nOur experts attempt to identify the different `unanswerable' factors for all 573 such questions in the corpus. 4.18% of the questions were identified as being incomprehensible (for example, `any difficulties to occupy the privacy assistant'). Amongst the comprehendable questions, 50% were identified as likely to have an answer within the privacy policy, 33.1% were identified as being privacy-related questions but not within the scope of a privacy policy (e.g., 'has Viber had any privacy breaches in the past?') and 16.9% of questions were identified as completely out-of-scope (e.g., `'will the app consume much space?'). In the questions identified as relevant, 32% were ill-formed questions that were phrased by the user in a manner considered vague or ambiguous. Of the questions that were both relevant as well as `well-formed', 95.7% of the questions were not answered by the policy in question but it was reasonable to expect that a privacy policy would contain an answer. The remaining 4.3% were described as reasonable questions, but of a nature generally not discussed in privacy policies. This suggests that the answerability of questions over privacy policies is a complex issue, and future systems should consider each of these factors when serving user's information seeking intent.\nWe examine a large-scale dataset of \u201cnatural\u201d unanswerable questions BIBREF54 based on real user search engine queries to identify if similar unanswerability factors exist. It is important to note that these questions have previously been filtered, according to a criteria for bad questions defined as \u201c(questions that are) ambiguous, incomprehensible, dependent on clear false presuppositions, opinion-seeking, or not clearly a request for factual information.\u201d Annotators made the decision based on the content of the question without viewing the equivalent Wikipedia page. We randomly sample 100 questions from the development set which were identified as unanswerable, and find that 20% of the questions are not questions (e.g., \u201call I want for christmas is you mariah carey tour\u201d). 12% of questions are unlikely to ever contain an answer on Wikipedia, corresponding closely to our atypicality category. 3% of questions are unlikely to have an answer anywhere (e.g., `what guides Santa home after he has delivered presents?'). 7% of questions are incomplete or open-ended (e.g., `the south west wind blows across nigeria between'). 3% of questions have an unresolvable coreference (e.g., `how do i get to Warsaw Missouri from here'). 4% of questions are vague, and a further 7% have unknown sources of error. 2% still contain false presuppositions (e.g., `what is the only fruit that does not have seeds?') and the remaining 42% do not have an answer within the document. This reinforces our belief that though they have been understudied in past work, any question answering system interacting with real users should expect to receive such unanticipated and unanswerable questions.\nConclusion\nWe present PrivacyQA, the first significant corpus of privacy policy questions and more than 3500 expert annotations of relevant answers. The goal of this work is to promote question-answering research in the specialized privacy domain, where it can have large real-world impact. Strong neural baselines on PrivacyQA achieve a performance of only 39.8 F1 on this corpus, indicating considerable room for future research. Further, we shed light on several important considerations that affect the answerability of questions. We hope this contribution leads to multidisciplinary efforts to precisely understand user intent and reconcile it with information in policy documents, from both the privacy and NLP communities.\nAcknowledgements\nThis research was supported in part by grants from the National Science Foundation Secure and Trustworthy Computing program (CNS-1330596, CNS-1330214, CNS-15-13957, CNS-1801316, CNS-1914486, CNS-1914444) and a DARPA Brandeis grant on Personalized Privacy Assistants (FA8750-15-2-0277).

As legal documents, they function using the principle of notice and choice BIBREF0, where companies post their policies, and theoretically, users read the policies and decide to use a company's products or services only if they find the conditions outlined in its privacy policy acceptable. Many legal jurisdictions around the world accept this framework, including the United States and the European Union BIBREF1, BIBREF2. However, the legitimacy of this framework depends upon users actually reading and understanding privacy policies to determine whether company practices are acceptable to them BIBREF3. In practice this is seldom the case BIBREF4, BIBREF5, BIBREF6, BIBREF7, BIBREF8, BIBREF9, BIBREF10. This is further complicated by the highly individual and nuanced compromises that users are willing to make with their data BIBREF11, discouraging a `one-size-fits-all' approach to notice of data practices in privacy documents.\nWith devices constantly monitoring our environment, including our personal space and our bodies, lack of awareness of how our data is being used easily leads to problematic situations where users are outraged by information misuse, but companies insist that users have consented. The discovery of increasingly egregious uses of data by companies, such as the scandals involving Facebook and Cambridge Analytica BIBREF12, have further brought public attention to the privacy concerns of the internet and ubiquitous computing. This makes privacy a well-motivated application domain for NLP researchers, where advances in enabling users to quickly identify the privacy issues most salient to them can potentially have large real-world impact.\n[1]https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gotokeep.keep.intl [2]https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.viber.voip [3]A question might not have any supporting evidence for an answer within the privacy policy.\nMotivated by this need, we contribute PrivacyQA, a corpus consisting of 1750 questions about the contents of privacy policies, paired with over 3500 expert annotations. The goal of this effort is to kickstart the development of question-answering methods for this domain, to address the (unrealistic) expectation that a large population should be reading many policies per day. In doing so, we identify several understudied challenges to our ability to answer these questions, with broad implications for systems seeking to serve users' information-seeking intent. By releasing this resource, we hope to provide an impetus to develop systems capable of language understanding in this increasingly important domain.\nRelated Work\nPrior work has aimed to make privacy policies easier to understand. Prescriptive approaches towards communicating privacy information BIBREF21, BIBREF22, BIBREF23 have not been widely adopted by industry. Recently, there have been significant research effort devoted to understanding privacy policies by leveraging NLP techniques BIBREF24, BIBREF25, BIBREF26, BIBREF27, BIBREF28, especially by identifying specific data practices within a privacy policy. We adopt a personalized approach to understanding privacy policies, that allows users to query a document and selectively explore content salient to them. Most similar is the PolisisQA corpus BIBREF29, which examines questions users ask corporations on Twitter. Our approach differs in several ways: 1) The PrivacyQA dataset is larger, containing 10x as many questions and answers. 2) Answers are formulated by domain experts with legal training. 3) PrivacyQA includes diverse question types, including unanswerable and subjective questions.\nOur work is also related to reading comprehension in the open domain, which is frequently based upon Wikipedia passages BIBREF16, BIBREF17, BIBREF15, BIBREF30 and news articles BIBREF20, BIBREF31, BIBREF32. Table.TABREF4 presents the desirable attributes our dataset shares with past approaches. This work is also tied into research in applying NLP approaches to legal documents BIBREF33, BIBREF34, BIBREF35, BIBREF36, BIBREF37, BIBREF38, BIBREF39. While privacy policies have legal implications, their intended audience consists of the general public rather than individuals with legal expertise. This arrangement is problematic because the entities that write privacy policies often have different goals than the audience. feng2015applying, tan-EtAl:2016:P16-1 examine question answering in the insurance domain, another specialized domain similar to privacy, where the intended audience is the general public.\nData Collection\nWe describe the data collection methodology used to construct PrivacyQA. With the goal of achieving broad coverage across application types, we collect privacy policies from 35 mobile applications representing a number of different categories in the Google Play Store. One of our goals is to include both policies from well-known applications, which are likely to have carefully-constructed privacy policies, and lesser-known applications with smaller install bases, whose policies might be considerably less sophisticated. Thus, setting 5 million installs as a threshold, we ensure each category includes applications with installs on both sides of this threshold. All policies included in the corpus are in English, and were collected before April 1, 2018, predating many companies' GDPR-focused BIBREF41 updates. We leave it to future studies BIBREF42 to look at the impact of the GDPR (e.g., to what extent GDPR requirements contribute to making it possible to provide users with more informative answers, and to what extent their disclosures continue to omit issues that matter to users).\nData Collection ::: Crowdsourced Question Elicitation\nThe intended audience for privacy policies consists of the general public. This informs the decision to elicit questions from crowdworkers on the contents of privacy policies. We choose not to show the contents of privacy policies to crowdworkers, a procedure motivated by a desire to avoid inadvertent biases BIBREF43, BIBREF44, BIBREF45, BIBREF46, BIBREF47, and encourage crowdworkers to ask a variety of questions beyond only asking questions based on practices described in the document.\nInstead, crowdworkers are presented with public information about a mobile application available on the Google Play Store including its name, description and navigable screenshots. Figure FIGREF9 shows an example of our user interface. Crowdworkers are asked to imagine they have access to a trusted third-party privacy assistant, to whom they can ask any privacy question about a given mobile application. We use the Amazon Mechanical Turk platform and recruit crowdworkers who have been conferred \u201cmaster\u201d status and are located within the United States of America. Turkers are asked to provide five questions per mobile application, and are paid $2 per assignment, taking ~eight minutes to complete the task.\nData Collection ::: Answer Selection\nTo identify legally sound answers, we recruit seven experts with legal training to construct answers to Turker questions. Experts identify relevant evidence within the privacy policy, as well as provide meta-annotation on the question's relevance, subjectivity, OPP-115 category BIBREF49, and how likely any privacy policy is to contain the answer to the question asked.\nData Collection ::: Analysis\nTable.TABREF17 presents aggregate statistics of the PrivacyQA dataset. 1750 questions are posed to our imaginary privacy assistant over 35 mobile applications and their associated privacy documents. As an initial step, we formulate the problem of answering user questions as an extractive sentence selection task, ignoring for now background knowledge, statistical data and legal expertise that could otherwise be brought to bear. The dataset is partitioned into a training set featuring 27 mobile applications and 1350 questions, and a test set consisting of 400 questions over 8 policy documents. This ensures that documents in training and test splits are mutually exclusive. Every question is answered by at least one expert. In addition, in order to estimate annotation reliability and provide for better evaluation, every question in the test set is answered by at least two additional experts.\nTable TABREF14 describes the distribution over first words of questions posed by crowdworkers. We also observe low redundancy in the questions posed by crowdworkers over each policy, with each policy receiving ~49.94 unique questions despite crowdworkers independently posing questions. Questions are on average 8.4 words long. As declining to answer a question can be a legally sound response but is seldom practically useful, answers to questions where a minority of experts abstain to answer are filtered from the dataset. Privacy policies are ~3000 words long on average. The answers to the question asked by the users typically have ~100 words of evidence in the privacy policy document.\nData Collection ::: Analysis ::: Categories of Questions\nQuestions are organized under nine categories from the OPP-115 Corpus annotation scheme BIBREF49:\nFirst Party Collection/Use: What, why and how information is collected by the service provider\nThird Party Sharing/Collection: What, why and how information shared with or collected by third parties\nData Security: Protection measures for user information\nData Retention: How long user information will be stored\nUser Choice/Control: Control options available to users\nUser Access, Edit and Deletion: If/how users can access, edit or delete information\nPolicy Change: Informing users if policy information has been changed\nInternational and Specific Audiences: Practices pertaining to a specific group of users\nOther: General text, contact information or practices not covered by other categories.\nFor each question, domain experts indicate one or more relevant OPP-115 categories. We mark a category as relevant to a question if it is identified as such by at least two annotators. If no such category exists, the category is marked as `Other' if atleast one annotator has identified the `Other' category to be relevant. If neither of these conditions is satisfied, we label the question as having no agreement. The distribution of questions in the corpus across OPP-115 categories is as shown in Table.TABREF16. First party and third party related questions are the largest categories, forming nearly 66.4% of all questions asked to the privacy assistant.\nData Collection ::: Analysis ::: Answer Validation\nWhen do experts disagree? We would like to analyze the reasons for potential disagreement on the annotation task, to ensure disagreements arise due to valid differences in opinion rather than lack of adequate specification in annotation guidelines. It is important to note that the annotators are experts rather than crowdworkers. Accordingly, their judgements can be considered valid, legally-informed opinions even when their perspectives differ. For the sake of this question we randomly sample 100 instances in the test data and analyze them for likely reasons for disagreements. We consider a disagreement to have occurred when more than one expert does not agree with the majority consensus. By disagreement we mean there is no overlap between the text identified as relevant by one expert and another.\nWe find that the annotators agree on the answer for 74% of the questions, even if the supporting evidence they identify is not identical i.e full overlap. They disagree on the remaining 26%. Sources of apparent disagreement correspond to situations when different experts: have differing interpretations of question intent (11%) (for example, when a user asks 'who can contact me through the app', the questions admits multiple interpretations, including seeking information about the features of the app, asking about first party collection/use of data or asking about third party collection/use of data), identify different sources of evidence for questions that ask if a practice is performed or not (4%), have differing interpretations of policy content (3%), identify a partial answer to a question in the privacy policy (2%) (for example, when the user asks `who is allowed to use the app' a majority of our annotators decline to answer, but the remaining annotators highlight partial evidence in the privacy policy which states that children under the age of 13 are not allowed to use the app), and other legitimate sources of disagreement (6%) which include personal subjective views of the annotators (for example, when the user asks `is my DNA information used in any way other than what is specified', some experts consider the boilerplate text of the privacy policy which states that it abides to practices described in the policy document as sufficient evidence to answer this question, whereas others do not).\nExperimental Setup\nWe evaluate the ability of machine learning methods to identify relevant evidence for questions in the privacy domain. We establish baselines for the subtask of deciding on the answerability (\u00a7SECREF33) of a question, as well as the overall task of identifying evidence for questions from policies (\u00a7SECREF37).

This results in vectors of 200, 201 and 228 dimensions respectively, which are provided to an SVM with a linear kernel.\nCNN: We utilize a CNN neural encoder for answerability prediction. We use GloVe word embeddings BIBREF50, and a filter size of 5 with 64 filters to encode questions.\nBERT: BERT BIBREF51 is a bidirectional transformer-based language-model BIBREF52.

Each reference answer is treated as the prediction, and the remaining n-1 answers are treated as the gold reference. The average of the maximum F1 across all reference answers is computed as the human baseline.\nResults and Discussion\nThe results of the answerability baselines are presented in Table TABREF31, and on answer sentence selection in Table TABREF32. We observe that bert exhibits the best performance on a binary answerability identification task. However, most baselines considerably exceed the performance of a majority-class baseline. This suggests considerable information in the question, indicating it's possible answerability within this domain.\nTable.TABREF32 describes the performance of our baselines on the answer sentence selection task. The No-answer (NA) baseline performs at 28 F1, providing a lower bound on performance at this task. We observe that our best-performing baseline, Bert + Unanswerable achieves an F1 of 39.8. This suggest that bert is capable of making some progress towards answering questions in this difficult domain, while still leaving considerable headroom for improvement to reach human performance. Bert + Unanswerable performance suggests that incorporating information about answerability can help in this difficult domain. We examine this challenging phenomena of unanswerability further in Section .\nResults and Discussion ::: Error Analysis\nDisagreements are analyzed based on the OPP-115 categories of each question (Table.TABREF34). We compare our best performing BERT variant against the NA model and human performance. We observe significant room for improvement across all categories of questions but especially for first party, third party and data retention categories.\nWe analyze the performance of our strongest BERT variant, to identify classes of errors and directions for future improvement (Table.8). We observe that a majority of answerability mistakes made by the BERT model are questions which are in fact answerable, but are identified as unanswerable by BERT. We observe that BERT makes 124 such mistakes on the test set. We collect expert judgments on relevance, subjectivity , silence and information about how likely the question is to be answered from the privacy policy from our experts. We find that most of these mistakes are relevant questions. However many of them were identified as subjective by the annotators, and at least one annotator marked 19 of these questions as having no answer within the privacy policy. However, only 6 of these questions were unexpected or do not usually have an answer in privacy policies. These findings suggest that a more nuanced understanding of answerability might help improve model performance in his challenging domain.\nResults and Discussion ::: What makes Questions Unanswerable?\nWe further ask legal experts to identify potential causes of unanswerability of questions. This analysis has considerable implications. While past work BIBREF17 has treated unanswerable questions as homogeneous, a question answering system might wish to have different treatments for different categories of `unanswerable' questions. The following factors were identified to play a role in unanswerability:\nIncomprehensibility: If a question is incomprehensible to the extent that its meaning is not intelligible.\nRelevance: Is this question in the scope of what could be answered by reading the privacy policy.\nIll-formedness: Is this question ambiguous or vague. An ambiguous statement will typically contain expressions that can refer to multiple potential explanations, whereas a vague statement carries a concept with an unclear or soft definition.\nSilence: Other policies answer this type of question but this one does not.\nAtypicality: The question is of a nature such that it is unlikely for any policy policy to have an answer to the question.\nOur experts attempt to identify the different `unanswerable' factors for all 573 such questions in the corpus. 4.18% of the questions were identified as being incomprehensible (for example, `any difficulties to occupy the privacy assistant'). Amongst the comprehendable questions, 50% were identified as likely to have an answer within the privacy policy, 33.1% were identified as being privacy-related questions but not within the scope of a privacy policy (e.g., 'has Viber had any privacy breaches in the past?') and 16.9% of questions were identified as completely out-of-scope (e.g., `'will the app consume much space?'). In the questions identified as relevant, 32% were ill-formed questions that were phrased by the user in a manner considered vague or ambiguous. Of the questions that were both relevant as well as `well-formed', 95.7% of the questions were not answered by the policy in question but it was reasonable to expect that a privacy policy would contain an answer. The remaining 4.3% were described as reasonable questions, but of a nature generally not discussed in privacy policies. This suggests that the answerability of questions over privacy policies is a complex issue, and future systems should consider each of these factors when serving user's information seeking intent.\nWe examine a large-scale dataset of \u201cnatural\u201d unanswerable questions BIBREF54 based on real user search engine queries to identify if similar unanswerability factors exist. It is important to note that these questions have previously been filtered, according to a criteria for bad questions defined as \u201c(questions that are) ambiguous, incomprehensible, dependent on clear false presuppositions, opinion-seeking, or not clearly a request for factual information.\u201d Annotators made the decision based on the content of the question without viewing the equivalent Wikipedia page. We randomly sample 100 questions from the development set which were identified as unanswerable, and find that 20% of the questions are not questions (e.g., \u201call I want for christmas is you mariah carey tour\u201d). 12% of questions are unlikely to ever contain an answer on Wikipedia, corresponding closely to our atypicality category. 3% of questions are unlikely to have an answer anywhere (e.g., `what guides Santa home after he has delivered presents?'). 7% of questions are incomplete or open-ended (e.g., `the south west wind blows across nigeria between'). 3% of questions have an unresolvable coreference (e.g., `how do i get to Warsaw Missouri from here'). 4% of questions are vague, and a further 7% have unknown sources of error. 2% still contain false presuppositions (e.g., `what is the only fruit that does not have seeds?') and the remaining 42% do not have an answer within the document. This reinforces our belief that though they have been understudied in past work, any question answering system interacting with real users should expect to receive such unanticipated and unanswerable questions.\nConclusion\nWe present PrivacyQA, the first significant corpus of privacy policy questions and more than 3500 expert annotations of relevant answers. The goal of this work is to promote question-answering research in the specialized privacy domain, where it can have large real-world impact. Strong neural baselines on PrivacyQA achieve a performance of only 39.8 F1 on this corpus, indicating considerable room for future research. Further, we shed light on several important considerations that affect the answerability of questions. We hope this contribution leads to multidisciplinary efforts to precisely understand user intent and reconcile it with information in policy documents, from both the privacy and NLP communities.\nAcknowledgements\nThis research was supported in part by grants from the National Science Foundation Secure and Trustworthy Computing program (CNS-1330596, CNS-1330214, CNS-15-13957, CNS-1801316, CNS-1914486, CNS-1914444) and a DARPA Brandeis grant on Personalized Privacy Assistants (FA8750-15-2-0277).

Translation between these low-resource languages (e.g., Arabic$\\rightarrow $Spanish) is usually accomplished with pivoting through a rich-resource language (such as English), i.e., Arabic (source) sentence is translated to English (pivot) first which is later translated to Spanish (target) BIBREF4, BIBREF5. However, the pivot-based method requires doubled decoding time and suffers from the propagation of translation errors.\nOne common alternative to avoid pivoting in NMT is transfer learning BIBREF6, BIBREF7, BIBREF8, BIBREF9 which leverages a high-resource pivot$\\rightarrow $target model (parent) to initialize a low-resource source$\\rightarrow $target model (child) that is further optimized with a small amount of available parallel data. Although this approach has achieved success in some low-resource language pairs, it still performs very poorly in extremely low-resource or zero-resource translation scenario. Specifically, BIBREF8 reports that without any child model training data, the performance of the parent model on the child test set is miserable.\nIn this work, we argue that the language space mismatch problem, also named domain shift problem BIBREF10, brings about the zero-shot translation failure in transfer learning. It is because transfer learning has no explicit training process to guarantee that the source and pivot languages share the same feature distributions, causing that the child model inherited from the parent model fails in such a situation. For instance, as illustrated in the left of Figure FIGREF1, the points of the sentence pair with the same semantics are not overlapping in source space, resulting in that the shared decoder will generate different translations denoted by different points in target space. Actually, transfer learning for NMT can be viewed as a multi-domain problem where each source language forms a new domain. Minimizing the discrepancy between the feature distributions of different source languages, i.e., different domains, will ensure the smooth transition between the parent and child models, as shown in the right of Figure FIGREF1. One way to achieve this goal is the fine-tuning technique, which forces the model to forget the specific knowledge from parent data and learn new features from child data. However, the domain shift problem still exists, and the demand of parallel child data for fine-tuning heavily hinders transfer learning for NMT towards the zero-resource setting.\nIn this paper, we explore the transfer learning in a common zero-shot scenario where there are a lot of source$\\leftrightarrow $pivot and pivot$\\leftrightarrow $target parallel data but no source$\\leftrightarrow $target parallel data. In this scenario, we propose a simple but effective transfer approach, the key idea of which is to relieve the burden of the domain shift problem by means of cross-lingual pre-training. To this end, we firstly investigate the performance of two existing cross-lingual pre-training methods proposed by BIBREF11 in zero-shot translation scenario. Besides, a novel pre-training method called BRidge Language Modeling (BRLM) is designed to make full use of the source$\\leftrightarrow $pivot bilingual data to obtain a universal encoder for different languages. Once the universal encoder is constructed, we only need to train the pivot$\\rightarrow $target model and then test this model in source$\\rightarrow $target direction directly. The main contributions of this paper are as follows:\nWe propose a new transfer learning approach for NMT which uses the cross-lingual language model pre-training to enable a high performance on zero-shot translation.\nWe propose a novel pre-training method called BRLM, which can effectively alleviates the distance between different source language spaces.\nOur proposed approach significantly improves zero-shot translation performance, consistently surpassing pivoting and multilingual approaches. Meanwhile, the performance on supervised translation direction remains the same level or even better when using our method.\nRelated Work\nIn recent years, zero-shot translation in NMT has attracted widespread attention in academic research. Existing methods are mainly divided into four categories: pivot-based method, transfer learning, multilingual NMT, and unsupervised NMT.\nPivot-based Method is a common strategy to obtain a source$\\rightarrow $target model by introducing a pivot language. This approach is further divided into pivoting and pivot-synthetic. While the former firstly translates a source language into the pivot language which is later translated to the target language BIBREF4, BIBREF5, BIBREF12, the latter trains a source$\\rightarrow $target model with pseudo data generated from source-pivot or pivot-target parallel data BIBREF13, BIBREF14. Although the pivot-based methods can achieve not bad performance, it always falls into a computation-expensive and parameter-vast dilemma of quadratic growth in the number of source languages, and suffers from the error propagation problem BIBREF15.\nTransfer Learning is firstly introduced for NMT by BIBREF6, which leverages a high-resource parent model to initialize the low-resource child model. On this basis, BIBREF7 and BIBREF8 use shared vocabularies for source/target language to improve transfer learning, while BIBREF16 relieve the vocabulary mismatch by mainly using cross-lingual word embedding. Although these methods are successful in the low-resource scene, they have limited effects in zero-shot translation.\nMultilingual NMT (MNMT) enables training a single model that supports translation from multiple source languages into multiple target languages, even those unseen language pairs BIBREF17, BIBREF18, BIBREF19, BIBREF20, BIBREF21. Aside from simpler deployment, MNMT benefits from transfer learning where low-resource language pairs are trained together with high-resource ones. However, BIBREF22 point out that MNMT for zero-shot translation easily fails, and is sensitive to the hyper-parameter setting. Also, MNMT usually performs worse than the pivot-based method in zero-shot translation setting BIBREF23.\nUnsupervised NMT (UNMT) considers a harder setting, in which only large-scale monolingual corpora are available for training. Recently, many methods have been proposed to improve the performance of UNMT, including using denoising auto-encoder, statistic machine translation (SMT) and unsupervised pre-training BIBREF24, BIBREF25, BIBREF26, BIBREF11. Since UNMT performs well between similar languages (e.g., English-German translation), its performance between distant languages is still far from expectation.\nOur proposed method belongs to the transfer learning, but it is different from traditional transfer methods which train a parent model as starting point. Before training a parent model, our approach fully leverages cross-lingual pre-training methods to make all source languages share the same feature space and thus enables a smooth transition for zero-shot translation.\nApproach\nIn this section, we will present a cross-lingual pre-training based transfer approach. This method is designed for a common zero-shot scenario where there are a lot of source$\\leftrightarrow $pivot and pivot$\\leftrightarrow $target bilingual data but no source$\\leftrightarrow $target parallel data, and the whole training process can be summarized as follows step by step:\nPre-train a universal encoder with source/pivot monolingual or source$\\leftrightarrow $pivot bilingual data.\nTrain a pivot$\\rightarrow $target parent model built on the pre-trained universal encoder with the available parallel data. During the training process, we freeze several layers of the pre-trained universal encoder to avoid the degeneracy issue BIBREF27.\nDirectly translate source sentences into target sentences with the parent model, which benefits from the availability of the universal encoder.\nThe key difficulty of this method is to ensure the intermediate representations of the universal encoder are language invariant. In the rest of this section, we first present two existing methods yet to be explored in zero-shot translation, and then propose a straightforward but effective cross-lingual pre-training method. In the end, we present the whole training and inference protocol for transfer.\nApproach ::: Masked and Translation Language Model Pretraining\nTwo existing cross-lingual pre-training methods, Masked Language Modeling (MLM) and Translation Language Modeling (TLM), have shown their effectiveness on XNLI cross-lingual classification task BIBREF11, BIBREF28, but these methods have not been well studied on cross-lingual generation tasks in zero-shot condition. We attempt to take advantage of the cross-lingual ability of the two methods for zero-shot translation.\nSpecifically, MLM adopts the Cloze objective of BERT BIBREF29 and predicts the masked words that are randomly selected and replaced with [MASK] token on monolingual corpus. In practice, MLM takes different language monolingual corpora as input to find features shared across different languages. With this method, word pieces shared in all languages have been mapped into a shared space, which makes the sentence representations across different languages close BIBREF30.\nSince MLM objective is unsupervised and only requires monolingual data, TLM is designed to leverage parallel data when it is available. Actually, TLM is a simple extension of MLM, with the difference that TLM concatenates sentence pair into a whole sentence, and then randomly masks words in both the source and target sentences. In this way, the model can either attend to surrounding words or to the translation sentence, implicitly encouraging the model to align the source and target language representations. Note that although each sentence pair is formed into one sentence, the positions of the target sentence are reset to count form zero.\nApproach ::: Bridge Language Model Pretraining\nAside from MLM and TLM, we propose BRidge Language Modeling (BRLM) to further obtain word-level representation alignment between different languages. This method is inspired by the assumption that if the feature spaces of different languages are aligned very well, the masked words in the corrupted sentence can also be guessed by the context of the correspondingly aligned words on the other side. To achieve this goal, BRLM is designed to strengthen the ability to infer words across languages based on alignment information, instead of inferring words within monolingual sentence as in MLM or within the pseudo sentence formed by concatenating sentence pair as in TLM.\nAs illustrated in Figure FIGREF9, BRLM stacks shared encoder over both side sentences separately. In particular, we design two network structures for BRLM, which are divided into Hard Alignment (BRLM-HA) and Soft Alignment (BRLM-SA) according to the way of generating the alignment information. These two structures actually extend MLM into a bilingual scenario, with the difference that BRLM leverages external aligner tool or additional attention layer to explicitly introduce alignment information during model training.\nHard Alignment (BRLM-HA). We first use external aligner tool on source$\\leftrightarrow $pivot parallel data to extract the alignment information of sentence pair. During model training, given source$\\leftrightarrow $pivot sentence pair, BRLM-HA randomly masks some words in source sentence and leverages alignment information to obtain the aligned words in pivot sentence for masked words. Based on the processed input, BRLM-HA adopts the Transformer BIBREF1 encoder to gain the hidden states for source and pivot sentences respectively. Then the training objective of BRLM-HA is to predict the masked words by not only the surrounding words in source sentence but also the encoder outputs of the aligned words. Note that this training process is also carried out in a symmetric situation, in which we mask some words in pivot sentence and obtain the aligned words in the source sentence.\nSoft Alignment (BRLM-SA). Instead of using external aligner tool, BRLM-SA introduces an additional attention layer to learn the alignment information together with model training. In this way, BRLM-SA avoids the effect caused by external wrong alignment information and enables many-to-one soft alignment during model training. Similar with BRLM-HA, the training objective of BRLM-SA is to predict the masked words by not only the surrounding words in source sentence but also the outputs of attention layer. In our implementation, the attention layer is a multi-head attention layer adopted in Transformer, where the queries come from the masked source sentence, the keys and values come from the pivot sentence.\nIn principle, MLM and TLM can learn some implicit alignment information during model training. However, the alignment process in MLM is inefficient since the shared word pieces only account for a small proportion of the whole corpus, resulting in the difficulty of expanding the shared information to align the whole corpus. TLM also lacks effort in alignment between the source and target sentences since TLM concatenates the sentence pair into one sequence, making the explicit alignment between the source and target infeasible. BRLM fully utilizes the alignment information to obtain better word-level representation alignment between different languages, which better relieves the burden of the domain shift problem.\nApproach ::: Transfer Protocol\nWe consider the typical zero-shot translation scenario in which a high resource pivot language has parallel data with both source and target languages, while source and target languages has no parallel data between themselves. Our proposed cross-lingual pretraining based transfer approach for source$\\rightarrow $target zero-shot translation is mainly divided into two phrases: the pretraining phase and the transfer phase.\nIn the pretraining phase, we first pretrain MLM on monolingual corpora of both source and pivot languages, and continue to pretrain TLM or the proposed BRLM on the available parallel data between source and pivot languages, in order to build a cross-lingual encoder shared by the source and pivot languages.\nIn the transfer phase, we train pivot$\\rightarrow $target NMT model initialized by the cross-lingually pre-trained encoder, and finally transfer the trained NMT model to source$\\rightarrow $target translation thanks to the shared encoder. Note that during training pivot$\\rightarrow $target NMT model, we freeze several layers of the cross-lingually pre-trained encoder to avoid the degeneracy issue.\nFor the more complicated scenario that either the source side or the target side has multiple languages, the encoder and the decoder are also shared across each side languages for efficient deployment of translation between multiple languages.\nExperiments ::: Setup\nWe evaluate our cross-lingual pre-training based transfer approach against several strong baselines on two public datatsets, Europarl BIBREF31 and MultiUN BIBREF32, which contain multi-parallel evaluation data to assess the zero-shot performance. In all experiments, we use BLEU as the automatic metric for translation evaluation.\nExperiments ::: Setup ::: Datasets.\nThe statistics of Europarl and MultiUN corpora are summarized in Table TABREF18. For Europarl corpus, we evaluate on French-English-Spanish (Fr-En-Es), German-English-French (De-En-Fr) and Romanian-English-German (Ro-En-De), where English acts as the pivot language, its left side is the source language, and its right side is the target language. We remove the multi-parallel sentences between different training corpora to ensure zero-shot settings. We use the devtest2006 as the validation set and the test2006 as the test set for Fr$\\rightarrow $Es and De$\\rightarrow $Fr. For distant language pair Ro$\\rightarrow $De, we extract 1,000 overlapping sentences from newstest2016 as the test set and the 2,000 overlapping sentences split from the training set as the validation set since there is no official validation and test sets. For vocabulary, we use 60K sub-word tokens based on Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) BIBREF33.\nFor MultiUN corpus, we use four languages: English (En) is set as the pivot language, which has parallel data with other three languages which do not have parallel data between each other. The three languages are Arabic (Ar), Spanish (Es), and Russian (Ru), and mutual translation between themselves constitutes six zero-shot translation direction for evaluation. We use 80K BPE splits as the vocabulary. Note that all sentences are tokenized by the tokenize.perl script, and we lowercase all data to avoid a large vocabulary for the MultiUN corpus.\nExperiments ::: Setup ::: Experimental Details.\nWe use traditional transfer learning, pivot-based method and multilingual NMT as our baselines. For the fair comparison, the Transformer-big model with 1024 embedding/hidden units, 4096 feed-forward filter size, 6 layers and 8 heads per layer is adopted for all translation models in our experiments. We set the batch size to 2400 per batch and limit sentence length to 100 BPE tokens. We set the $\\text{attn}\\_\\text{drop}=0$ (a dropout rate on each attention head), which is favorable to the zero-shot translation and has no effect on supervised translation directions BIBREF22. For the model initialization, we use Facebook's cross-lingual pretrained models released by XLM to initialize the encoder part, and the rest parameters are initialized with xavier uniform. We employ the Adam optimizer with $\\text{lr}=0.0001$, $t_{\\text{warm}\\_\\text{up}}=4000$ and $\\text{dropout}=0.1$. At decoding time, we generate greedily with length penalty $\\alpha =1.0$.\nRegarding MLM, TLM and BRLM, as mentioned in the pre-training phase of transfer protocol, we first pre-train MLM on monolingual data of both source and pivot languages, then leverage the parameters of MLM to initialize TLM and the proposed BRLM, which are continued to be optimized with source-pivot bilingual data. In our experiments, we use MLM+TLM, MLM+BRLM to represent this training process. For the masking strategy during training, following BIBREF29, $15\\%$ of BPE tokens are selected to be masked. Among the selected tokens, $80\\%$ of them are replaced with [MASK] token, $10\\%$ are replaced with a random BPE token, and $10\\%$ unchanged. The prediction accuracy of masked words is used as a stopping criterion in the pre-training stage. Besides, we use fastalign tool BIBREF34 to extract word alignments for BRLM-HA.\nExperiments ::: Main Results\nTable TABREF19 and TABREF26 report zero-shot results on Europarl and Multi-UN evaluation sets, respectively. We compare our approaches with related approaches of pivoting, multilingual NMT (MNMT) BIBREF19, and cross-lingual transfer without pretraining BIBREF16. The results show that our approaches consistently outperform other approaches across languages and datasets, especially surpass pivoting, which is a strong baseline in the zero-shot scenario that multilingual NMT systems often fail to beat BIBREF19, BIBREF20, BIBREF23. Pivoting translates source to pivot then to target in two steps, causing inefficient translation process. Our approaches use one encoder-decoder model to translate between any zero-shot directions, which is more efficient than pivoting. Regarding the comparison between transfer approaches, our cross-lingual pretraining based transfer outperforms transfer method that does not use pretraining by a large margin.\nExperiments ::: Main Results ::: Results on Europarl Dataset.\nRegarding comparison between the baselines in table TABREF19, we find that pivoting is the strongest baseline that has significant advantage over other two baselines. Cross-lingual transfer for languages without shared vocabularies BIBREF16 manifests the worst performance because of not using source$\\leftrightarrow $pivot parallel data, which is utilized as beneficial supervised signal for the other two baselines.\nOur best approach of MLM+BRLM-SA achieves the significant superior performance to all baselines in the zero-shot directions, improving by 0.9-4.8 BLEU points over the strong pivoting. Meanwhile, in the supervised direction of pivot$\\rightarrow $target, our approaches performs even better than the original supervised Transformer thanks to the shared encoder trained on both large-scale monolingual data and parallel data between multiple languages.\nMLM alone that does not use source$\\leftrightarrow $pivot parallel data performs much better than the cross-lingual transfer, and achieves comparable results to pivoting. When MLM is combined with TLM or the proposed BRLM, the performance is further improved. MLM+BRLM-SA performs the best, and is better than MLM+BRLM-HA indicating that soft alignment is helpful than hard alignment for the cross-lingual pretraining.\nExperiments ::: Main Results ::: Results on MultiUN Dataset.\nLike experimental results on Europarl, MLM+BRLM-SA performs the best among all proposed cross-lingual pretraining based transfer approaches as shown in Table TABREF26. When comparing systems consisting of one encoder-decoder model for all zero-shot translation, our approaches performs significantly better than MNMT BIBREF19.\nAlthough it is challenging for one model to translate all zero-shot directions between multiple distant language pairs of MultiUN, MLM+BRLM-SA still achieves better performances on Es $\\rightarrow $ Ar and Es $\\rightarrow $ Ru than strong pivoting$_{\\rm m}$, which uses MNMT to translate source to pivot then to target in two separate steps with each step receiving supervised signal of parallel corpora. Our approaches surpass pivoting$_{\\rm m}$ in all zero-shot directions by adding back translation BIBREF33 to generate pseudo parallel sentences for all zero-shot directions based on our pretrained models such as MLM+BRLM-SA, and further training our universal encoder-decoder model with these pseudo data. BIBREF22 gu2019improved introduces back translation into MNMT, while we adopt it in our transfer approaches. Finally, our best MLM+BRLM-SA with back translation outperforms pivoting$_{\\rm m}$ by 2.4 BLEU points averagely, and outperforms MNMT BIBREF22 by 4.6 BLEU points averagely. Again, in supervised translation directions, MLM+BRLM-SA with back translation also achieves better performance than the original supervised Transformer.\nExperiments ::: Analysis ::: Sentence Representation.\nWe first evaluate the representational invariance across languages for all cross-lingual pre-training methods. Following BIBREF23, we adopt max-pooling operation to collect the sentence representation of each encoder layer for all source-pivot sentence pairs in the Europarl validation sets. Then we calculate the cosine similarity for each sentence pair and average all cosine scores. As shown in Figure FIGREF27, we can observe that, MLM+BRLM-SA has the most stable and similar cross-lingual representations of sentence pairs on all layers, while it achieves the best performance in zero-shot translation. This demonstrates that better cross-lingual representations can benefit for the process of transfer learning. Besides, MLM+BRLM-HA is not as superior as MLM+BRLM-SA and even worse than MLM+TLM on Fr-En, since MLM+BRLM-HA may suffer from the wrong alignment knowledge from an external aligner tool. We also find an interesting phenomenon that as the number of layers increases, the cosine similarity decreases.\nExperiments ::: Analysis ::: Contextualized Word Representation.\nWe further sample an English-Russian sentence pair from the MultiUN validation sets and visualize the cosine similarity between hidden states of the top encoder layer to further investigate the difference of all cross-lingual pre-training methods. As shown in Figure FIGREF38, the hidden states generated by MLM+BRLM-SA have higher similarity for two aligned words. It indicates that MLM+BRLM-SA can gain better word-level representation alignment between source and pivot languages, which better relieves the burden of the domain shift problem.\nExperiments ::: Analysis ::: The Effect of Freezing Parameters.\nTo freeze parameters is a common strategy to avoid catastrophic forgetting in transfer learning BIBREF27. Table TABREF43 shows the performance of transfer learning with freezing different layers on MultiUN test set, in which En$\\rightarrow $Ru denotes the parent model, Ar$\\rightarrow $Ru and Es$\\rightarrow $Ru are two child models, and all models are based on MLM+BRLM-SA. We can find that updating all parameters during training will cause a notable drop on the zero-shot direction due to the catastrophic forgetting. On the contrary, freezing all the parameters leads to the decline on supervised direction because the language features extracted during pre-training is not sufficient for MT task. Freezing the first four layers of the transformer shows the best performance and keeps the balance between pre-training and fine-tuning.\nConclusion\nIn this paper, we propose a cross-lingual pretraining based transfer approach for the challenging zero-shot translation task, in which source and target languages have no parallel data, while they both have parallel data with a high resource pivot language. With the aim of building the language invariant representation between source and pivot languages for smooth transfer of the parent model of pivot$\\rightarrow $target direction to the child model of source$\\rightarrow $target direction, we introduce one monolingual pretraining method and two bilingual pretraining methods to construct an universal encoder for the source and pivot languages. Experiments on public datasets show that our approaches significantly outperforms several strong baseline systems, and manifest the language invariance characteristics in both sentence level and word level neural representations.\nAcknowledgments\nWe would like to thank the anonymous reviewers for the helpful comments.

In this scenario, we propose a simple but effective transfer approach, the key idea of which is to relieve the burden of the domain shift problem by means of cross-lingual pre-training. To this end, we firstly investigate the performance of two existing cross-lingual pre-training methods proposed by BIBREF11 in zero-shot translation scenario. Besides, a novel pre-training method called BRidge Language Modeling (BRLM) is designed to make full use of the source$\\leftrightarrow $pivot bilingual data to obtain a universal encoder for different languages. Once the universal encoder is constructed, we only need to train the pivot$\\rightarrow $target model and then test this model in source$\\rightarrow $target direction directly. The main contributions of this paper are as follows:\nWe propose a new transfer learning approach for NMT which uses the cross-lingual language model pre-training to enable a high performance on zero-shot translation.\nWe propose a novel pre-training method called BRLM, which can effectively alleviates the distance between different source language spaces.\nOur proposed approach significantly improves zero-shot translation performance, consistently surpassing pivoting and multilingual approaches. Meanwhile, the performance on supervised translation direction remains the same level or even better when using our method.\nRelated Work\nIn recent years, zero-shot translation in NMT has attracted widespread attention in academic research. Existing methods are mainly divided into four categories: pivot-based method, transfer learning, multilingual NMT, and unsupervised NMT.\nPivot-based Method is a common strategy to obtain a source$\\rightarrow $target model by introducing a pivot language. This approach is further divided into pivoting and pivot-synthetic. While the former firstly translates a source language into the pivot language which is later translated to the target language BIBREF4, BIBREF5, BIBREF12, the latter trains a source$\\rightarrow $target model with pseudo data generated from source-pivot or pivot-target parallel data BIBREF13, BIBREF14. Although the pivot-based methods can achieve not bad performance, it always falls into a computation-expensive and parameter-vast dilemma of quadratic growth in the number of source languages, and suffers from the error propagation problem BIBREF15.\nTransfer Learning is firstly introduced for NMT by BIBREF6, which leverages a high-resource parent model to initialize the low-resource child model. On this basis, BIBREF7 and BIBREF8 use shared vocabularies for source/target language to improve transfer learning, while BIBREF16 relieve the vocabulary mismatch by mainly using cross-lingual word embedding. Although these methods are successful in the low-resource scene, they have limited effects in zero-shot translation.\nMultilingual NMT (MNMT) enables training a single model that supports translation from multiple source languages into multiple target languages, even those unseen language pairs BIBREF17, BIBREF18, BIBREF19, BIBREF20, BIBREF21. Aside from simpler deployment, MNMT benefits from transfer learning where low-resource language pairs are trained together with high-resource ones. However, BIBREF22 point out that MNMT for zero-shot translation easily fails, and is sensitive to the hyper-parameter setting. Also, MNMT usually performs worse than the pivot-based method in zero-shot translation setting BIBREF23.\nUnsupervised NMT (UNMT) considers a harder setting, in which only large-scale monolingual corpora are available for training. Recently, many methods have been proposed to improve the performance of UNMT, including using denoising auto-encoder, statistic machine translation (SMT) and unsupervised pre-training BIBREF24, BIBREF25, BIBREF26, BIBREF11. Since UNMT performs well between similar languages (e.g., English-German translation), its performance between distant languages is still far from expectation.\nOur proposed method belongs to the transfer learning, but it is different from traditional transfer methods which train a parent model as starting point. Before training a parent model, our approach fully leverages cross-lingual pre-training methods to make all source languages share the same feature space and thus enables a smooth transition for zero-shot translation.\nApproach\nIn this section, we will present a cross-lingual pre-training based transfer approach. This method is designed for a common zero-shot scenario where there are a lot of source$\\leftrightarrow $pivot and pivot$\\leftrightarrow $target bilingual data but no source$\\leftrightarrow $target parallel data, and the whole training process can be summarized as follows step by step:\nPre-train a universal encoder with source/pivot monolingual or source$\\leftrightarrow $pivot bilingual data.\nTrain a pivot$\\rightarrow $target parent model built on the pre-trained universal encoder with the available parallel data. During the training process, we freeze several layers of the pre-trained universal encoder to avoid the degeneracy issue BIBREF27.\nDirectly translate source sentences into target sentences with the parent model, which benefits from the availability of the universal encoder.\nThe key difficulty of this method is to ensure the intermediate representations of the universal encoder are language invariant. In the rest of this section, we first present two existing methods yet to be explored in zero-shot translation, and then propose a straightforward but effective cross-lingual pre-training method. In the end, we present the whole training and inference protocol for transfer.\nApproach ::: Masked and Translation Language Model Pretraining\nTwo existing cross-lingual pre-training methods, Masked Language Modeling (MLM) and Translation Language Modeling (TLM), have shown their effectiveness on XNLI cross-lingual classification task BIBREF11, BIBREF28, but these methods have not been well studied on cross-lingual generation tasks in zero-shot condition. We attempt to take advantage of the cross-lingual ability of the two methods for zero-shot translation.\nSpecifically, MLM adopts the Cloze objective of BERT BIBREF29 and predicts the masked words that are randomly selected and replaced with [MASK] token on monolingual corpus. In practice, MLM takes different language monolingual corpora as input to find features shared across different languages. With this method, word pieces shared in all languages have been mapped into a shared space, which makes the sentence representations across different languages close BIBREF30.\nSince MLM objective is unsupervised and only requires monolingual data, TLM is designed to leverage parallel data when it is available. Actually, TLM is a simple extension of MLM, with the difference that TLM concatenates sentence pair into a whole sentence, and then randomly masks words in both the source and target sentences. In this way, the model can either attend to surrounding words or to the translation sentence, implicitly encouraging the model to align the source and target language representations. Note that although each sentence pair is formed into one sentence, the positions of the target sentence are reset to count form zero.\nApproach ::: Bridge Language Model Pretraining\nAside from MLM and TLM, we propose BRidge Language Modeling (BRLM) to further obtain word-level representation alignment between different languages. This method is inspired by the assumption that if the feature spaces of different languages are aligned very well, the masked words in the corrupted sentence can also be guessed by the context of the correspondingly aligned words on the other side. To achieve this goal, BRLM is designed to strengthen the ability to infer words across languages based on alignment information, instead of inferring words within monolingual sentence as in MLM or within the pseudo sentence formed by concatenating sentence pair as in TLM.\nAs illustrated in Figure FIGREF9, BRLM stacks shared encoder over both side sentences separately. In particular, we design two network structures for BRLM, which are divided into Hard Alignment (BRLM-HA) and Soft Alignment (BRLM-SA) according to the way of generating the alignment information. These two structures actually extend MLM into a bilingual scenario, with the difference that BRLM leverages external aligner tool or additional attention layer to explicitly introduce alignment information during model training.\nHard Alignment (BRLM-HA). We first use external aligner tool on source$\\leftrightarrow $pivot parallel data to extract the alignment information of sentence pair. During model training, given source$\\leftrightarrow $pivot sentence pair, BRLM-HA randomly masks some words in source sentence and leverages alignment information to obtain the aligned words in pivot sentence for masked words. Based on the processed input, BRLM-HA adopts the Transformer BIBREF1 encoder to gain the hidden states for source and pivot sentences respectively. Then the training objective of BRLM-HA is to predict the masked words by not only the surrounding words in source sentence but also the encoder outputs of the aligned words. Note that this training process is also carried out in a symmetric situation, in which we mask some words in pivot sentence and obtain the aligned words in the source sentence.\nSoft Alignment (BRLM-SA). Instead of using external aligner tool, BRLM-SA introduces an additional attention layer to learn the alignment information together with model training. In this way, BRLM-SA avoids the effect caused by external wrong alignment information and enables many-to-one soft alignment during model training. Similar with BRLM-HA, the training objective of BRLM-SA is to predict the masked words by not only the surrounding words in source sentence but also the outputs of attention layer. In our implementation, the attention layer is a multi-head attention layer adopted in Transformer, where the queries come from the masked source sentence, the keys and values come from the pivot sentence.\nIn principle, MLM and TLM can learn some implicit alignment information during model training. However, the alignment process in MLM is inefficient since the shared word pieces only account for a small proportion of the whole corpus, resulting in the difficulty of expanding the shared information to align the whole corpus. TLM also lacks effort in alignment between the source and target sentences since TLM concatenates the sentence pair into one sequence, making the explicit alignment between the source and target infeasible. BRLM fully utilizes the alignment information to obtain better word-level representation alignment between different languages, which better relieves the burden of the domain shift problem.\nApproach ::: Transfer Protocol\nWe consider the typical zero-shot translation scenario in which a high resource pivot language has parallel data with both source and target languages, while source and target languages has no parallel data between themselves. Our proposed cross-lingual pretraining based transfer approach for source$\\rightarrow $target zero-shot translation is mainly divided into two phrases: the pretraining phase and the transfer phase.\nIn the pretraining phase, we first pretrain MLM on monolingual corpora of both source and pivot languages, and continue to pretrain TLM or the proposed BRLM on the available parallel data between source and pivot languages, in order to build a cross-lingual encoder shared by the source and pivot languages.\nIn the transfer phase, we train pivot$\\rightarrow $target NMT model initialized by the cross-lingually pre-trained encoder, and finally transfer the trained NMT model to source$\\rightarrow $target translation thanks to the shared encoder. Note that during training pivot$\\rightarrow $target NMT model, we freeze several layers of the cross-lingually pre-trained encoder to avoid the degeneracy issue.\nFor the more complicated scenario that either the source side or the target side has multiple languages, the encoder and the decoder are also shared across each side languages for efficient deployment of translation between multiple languages.\nExperiments ::: Setup\nWe evaluate our cross-lingual pre-training based transfer approach against several strong baselines on two public datatsets, Europarl BIBREF31 and MultiUN BIBREF32, which contain multi-parallel evaluation data to assess the zero-shot performance. In all experiments, we use BLEU as the automatic metric for translation evaluation.\nExperiments ::: Setup ::: Datasets.\nThe statistics of Europarl and MultiUN corpora are summarized in Table TABREF18. For Europarl corpus, we evaluate on French-English-Spanish (Fr-En-Es), German-English-French (De-En-Fr) and Romanian-English-German (Ro-En-De), where English acts as the pivot language, its left side is the source language, and its right side is the target language. We remove the multi-parallel sentences between different training corpora to ensure zero-shot settings. We use the devtest2006 as the validation set and the test2006 as the test set for Fr$\\rightarrow $Es and De$\\rightarrow $Fr. For distant language pair Ro$\\rightarrow $De, we extract 1,000 overlapping sentences from newstest2016 as the test set and the 2,000 overlapping sentences split from the training set as the validation set since there is no official validation and test sets. For vocabulary, we use 60K sub-word tokens based on Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) BIBREF33.\nFor MultiUN corpus, we use four languages: English (En) is set as the pivot language, which has parallel data with other three languages which do not have parallel data between each other. The three languages are Arabic (Ar), Spanish (Es), and Russian (Ru), and mutual translation between themselves constitutes six zero-shot translation direction for evaluation. We use 80K BPE splits as the vocabulary. Note that all sentences are tokenized by the tokenize.perl script, and we lowercase all data to avoid a large vocabulary for the MultiUN corpus.\nExperiments ::: Setup ::: Experimental Details.\nWe use traditional transfer learning, pivot-based method and multilingual NMT as our baselines. For the fair comparison, the Transformer-big model with 1024 embedding/hidden units, 4096 feed-forward filter size, 6 layers and 8 heads per layer is adopted for all translation models in our experiments. We set the batch size to 2400 per batch and limit sentence length to 100 BPE tokens. We set the $\\text{attn}\\_\\text{drop}=0$ (a dropout rate on each attention head), which is favorable to the zero-shot translation and has no effect on supervised translation directions BIBREF22. For the model initialization, we use Facebook's cross-lingual pretrained models released by XLM to initialize the encoder part, and the rest parameters are initialized with xavier uniform. We employ the Adam optimizer with $\\text{lr}=0.0001$, $t_{\\text{warm}\\_\\text{up}}=4000$ and $\\text{dropout}=0.1$. At decoding time, we generate greedily with length penalty $\\alpha =1.0$.\nRegarding MLM, TLM and BRLM, as mentioned in the pre-training phase of transfer protocol, we first pre-train MLM on monolingual data of both source and pivot languages, then leverage the parameters of MLM to initialize TLM and the proposed BRLM, which are continued to be optimized with source-pivot bilingual data. In our experiments, we use MLM+TLM, MLM+BRLM to represent this training process. For the masking strategy during training, following BIBREF29, $15\\%$ of BPE tokens are selected to be masked. Among the selected tokens, $80\\%$ of them are replaced with [MASK] token, $10\\%$ are replaced with a random BPE token, and $10\\%$ unchanged. The prediction accuracy of masked words is used as a stopping criterion in the pre-training stage. Besides, we use fastalign tool BIBREF34 to extract word alignments for BRLM-HA.\nExperiments ::: Main Results\nTable TABREF19 and TABREF26 report zero-shot results on Europarl and Multi-UN evaluation sets, respectively. We compare our approaches with related approaches of pivoting, multilingual NMT (MNMT) BIBREF19, and cross-lingual transfer without pretraining BIBREF16. The results show that our approaches consistently outperform other approaches across languages and datasets, especially surpass pivoting, which is a strong baseline in the zero-shot scenario that multilingual NMT systems often fail to beat BIBREF19, BIBREF20, BIBREF23. Pivoting translates source to pivot then to target in two steps, causing inefficient translation process. Our approaches use one encoder-decoder model to translate between any zero-shot directions, which is more efficient than pivoting. Regarding the comparison between transfer approaches, our cross-lingual pretraining based transfer outperforms transfer method that does not use pretraining by a large margin.\nExperiments ::: Main Results ::: Results on Europarl Dataset.\nRegarding comparison between the baselines in table TABREF19, we find that pivoting is the strongest baseline that has significant advantage over other two baselines. Cross-lingual transfer for languages without shared vocabularies BIBREF16 manifests the worst performance because of not using source$\\leftrightarrow $pivot parallel data, which is utilized as beneficial supervised signal for the other two baselines.\nOur best approach of MLM+BRLM-SA achieves the significant superior performance to all baselines in the zero-shot directions, improving by 0.9-4.8 BLEU points over the strong pivoting. Meanwhile, in the supervised direction of pivot$\\rightarrow $target, our approaches performs even better than the original supervised Transformer thanks to the shared encoder trained on both large-scale monolingual data and parallel data between multiple languages.\nMLM alone that does not use source$\\leftrightarrow $pivot parallel data performs much better than the cross-lingual transfer, and achieves comparable results to pivoting. When MLM is combined with TLM or the proposed BRLM, the performance is further improved. MLM+BRLM-SA performs the best, and is better than MLM+BRLM-HA indicating that soft alignment is helpful than hard alignment for the cross-lingual pretraining.\nExperiments ::: Main Results ::: Results on MultiUN Dataset.\nLike experimental results on Europarl, MLM+BRLM-SA performs the best among all proposed cross-lingual pretraining based transfer approaches as shown in Table TABREF26. When comparing systems consisting of one encoder-decoder model for all zero-shot translation, our approaches performs significantly better than MNMT BIBREF19.\nAlthough it is challenging for one model to translate all zero-shot directions between multiple distant language pairs of MultiUN, MLM+BRLM-SA still achieves better performances on Es $\\rightarrow $ Ar and Es $\\rightarrow $ Ru than strong pivoting$_{\\rm m}$, which uses MNMT to translate source to pivot then to target in two separate steps with each step receiving supervised signal of parallel corpora. Our approaches surpass pivoting$_{\\rm m}$ in all zero-shot directions by adding back translation BIBREF33 to generate pseudo parallel sentences for all zero-shot directions based on our pretrained models such as MLM+BRLM-SA, and further training our universal encoder-decoder model with these pseudo data. BIBREF22 gu2019improved introduces back translation into MNMT, while we adopt it in our transfer approaches. Finally, our best MLM+BRLM-SA with back translation outperforms pivoting$_{\\rm m}$ by 2.4 BLEU points averagely, and outperforms MNMT BIBREF22 by 4.6 BLEU points averagely. Again, in supervised translation directions, MLM+BRLM-SA with back translation also achieves better performance than the original supervised Transformer.\nExperiments ::: Analysis ::: Sentence Representation.\nWe first evaluate the representational invariance across languages for all cross-lingual pre-training methods. Following BIBREF23, we adopt max-pooling operation to collect the sentence representation of each encoder layer for all source-pivot sentence pairs in the Europarl validation sets. Then we calculate the cosine similarity for each sentence pair and average all cosine scores. As shown in Figure FIGREF27, we can observe that, MLM+BRLM-SA has the most stable and similar cross-lingual representations of sentence pairs on all layers, while it achieves the best performance in zero-shot translation. This demonstrates that better cross-lingual representations can benefit for the process of transfer learning. Besides, MLM+BRLM-HA is not as superior as MLM+BRLM-SA and even worse than MLM+TLM on Fr-En, since MLM+BRLM-HA may suffer from the wrong alignment knowledge from an external aligner tool. We also find an interesting phenomenon that as the number of layers increases, the cosine similarity decreases.\nExperiments ::: Analysis ::: Contextualized Word Representation.\nWe further sample an English-Russian sentence pair from the MultiUN validation sets and visualize the cosine similarity between hidden states of the top encoder layer to further investigate the difference of all cross-lingual pre-training methods. As shown in Figure FIGREF38, the hidden states generated by MLM+BRLM-SA have higher similarity for two aligned words. It indicates that MLM+BRLM-SA can gain better word-level representation alignment between source and pivot languages, which better relieves the burden of the domain shift problem.\nExperiments ::: Analysis ::: The Effect of Freezing Parameters.\nTo freeze parameters is a common strategy to avoid catastrophic forgetting in transfer learning BIBREF27. Table TABREF43 shows the performance of transfer learning with freezing different layers on MultiUN test set, in which En$\\rightarrow $Ru denotes the parent model, Ar$\\rightarrow $Ru and Es$\\rightarrow $Ru are two child models, and all models are based on MLM+BRLM-SA. We can find that updating all parameters during training will cause a notable drop on the zero-shot direction due to the catastrophic forgetting. On the contrary, freezing all the parameters leads to the decline on supervised direction because the language features extracted during pre-training is not sufficient for MT task. Freezing the first four layers of the transformer shows the best performance and keeps the balance between pre-training and fine-tuning.\nConclusion\nIn this paper, we propose a cross-lingual pretraining based transfer approach for the challenging zero-shot translation task, in which source and target languages have no parallel data, while they both have parallel data with a high resource pivot language. With the aim of building the language invariant representation between source and pivot languages for smooth transfer of the parent model of pivot$\\rightarrow $target direction to the child model of source$\\rightarrow $target direction, we introduce one monolingual pretraining method and two bilingual pretraining methods to construct an universal encoder for the source and pivot languages. Experiments on public datasets show that our approaches significantly outperforms several strong baseline systems, and manifest the language invariance characteristics in both sentence level and word level neural representations.\nAcknowledgments\nWe would like to thank the anonymous reviewers for the helpful comments.

Researchers aim to recognize the emotion behind the text and distribute similar ones into the same group. Establishing an emotion classifier can not only understand each user's feeling but also be extended to various application, for example, the motivation behind a user's interests BIBREF0. Based on releasing of large text corpus on social media and the emotion categories proposed by BIBREF1, BIBREF2, numerous models have provided and achieved fabulous precision so far. For example, DeepMoji BIBREF3 which utilized transfer learning concept to enhance emotions and sarcasm understanding behind the target sentence. CARER BIBREF4 learned contextualized affect representations to make itself more sensitive to rare words and the scenario behind the texts.\nAs methods become mature, text-based emotion detecting applications can be extended from a single utterance to a dialogue contributed by a series of utterances. Table TABREF2 illustrates the difference between single utterance and dialogue emotion recognition. The same utterances in Table TABREF2, even the same person said the same sentence, the emotion it convey may be various, which may depend on different background of the conversation, tone of speaking or personality. Therefore, for emotion detection, the information from preceding utterances in a conversation is relatively critical.\nIn SocialNLP 2019 EmotionX, the challenge is to recognize emotions for all utterances in EmotionLines dataset, a dataset consists of dialogues. According to the needs for considering context at the same time, we develop two classification models, inspired by bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) BIBREF5, FriendsBERT and ChatBERT. In this paper, we introduce our approaches including causal utterance modeling, model pre-training, and fine-turning.\nDataset\nEmotionLines BIBREF6 is a dialogue dataset composed of two subsets, Friends and EmotionPush, according to the source of the dialogues. The former comes from the scripts of the Friends TV sitcom. The other is made up of Facebook messenger chats. Each subset includes $1,000$ English dialogues, and each dialogue can be further divided into a few consecutive utterances. All the utterances are annotated by five annotators on a crowd-sourcing platform (Amazon Mechanical Turk), and the labeling work is only based on the textual content. Annotator votes for one of the seven emotions, namely Ekman\u2019s six basic emotions BIBREF1, plus the neutral. If none of the emotion gets more than three votes, the utterance will be marked as \u201cnon-neutral\u201d.\nFor the datasets, there are properties worth additional mentioning. Although Friends and EmotionPush share the same data format, they are quite different in nature. Friends is a speech-based dataset which is annotated dialogues from the TV sitcom. It means most of the utterances are generated by the a few main characters. The personality of a character often affects the way of speaking, and therefore \u201cwho is the speaker\" might provide extra clues for emotion prediction. In contrast, EmotionPush does not have this trait due to the anonymous mechanism. In addition, features such as typo, hyperlink, and emoji that only appear in chat-based data will need some domain-specific techniques to process.\nIncidentally, the objective of the challenge is to predict the emotion for each utterance. Just, according to EmotionX 2019 specification, there are only four emotions be selected as our label candidates, which are Joy, Sadness, Anger, and Neutral. These emotions will be considered during performance evaluation. The technical detail will also be introduced and discussed in following Section SECREF13 and Section SECREF26.\nModel Description\nFor this challenge, we adapt BERT which is proposed by BIBREF5 to help understand the context at the same time. Technically, BERT, designed on end-to-end architecture, is a deep pre-trained transformer encoder that dynamically provides language representation and BERT already achieved multiple state-of-the-art results on GLUE benchmark BIBREF7 and many tasks. A quick recap for BERT's architecture and its pre-training tasks will be illustrated in the following subsections.\nModel Description ::: Model Architecture\nBERT, the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers, consists of several transformer encoder layers that enable the model to extract very deep language features on both token-level and sentence-level. Each transformer encoder contains multi-head self-attention layers that provide ability to learn multiple attention feature of each word from their bidirectional context. The transformer and its self-attention mechanism are proposed by BIBREF8. This self-attention mechanism can be interpreted as a key-value mapping given query. By given the embedding vector for token input, the query ($Q$), key ($K$) and value ($V$) are produced by the projection from each three parameter matrices where $W^Q \\in \\mathbb {R}^{d_{{\\rm model}} \\times d_{k}}, W^K \\in \\mathbb {R}^{d_{\\rm model} \\times d_{k}}$ and $W^V \\in \\mathbb {R}^{d_{\\rm model} \\times d_{v}}$. The self-attention BIBREF8 is formally represented as:\nThe $ d_k = d_v = d_{\\rm model} = 1024$ in BERT large version and 768 in BERT base version. Once model can extract attention feature, we can extend one self-attention into multi-head self-attention, this extension makes sub-space features can be extracted in same time by this multi-head configuration. Overall, the multi-attention mechanism is adopt for each transformer encoder, and several of encoder layer will be stacked together to form a deep transformer encoder.\nFor the model input, BERT allow us take one sentence as input sequence or two sentences together as one input sequence, and the maximum length of input sequence is 512. The way that BERT was designed is for giving model the sentence-level and token-level understanding. In two sentences case, a special token ([SEP]) will be inserted between two sentences. In addition, the first input token is also a special token ([CLS]), and its corresponding ouput will be vector place for classification during fine-tuning. The outputs of the last encoder layer corresponding to each input token can be treated as word representations for each token, and the word representation of the first token ([CLS]) will be consider as classification (output) representation for further fine-tuning tasks. In BERT, this vector is denoted as $C \\in \\mathbb {R}^{d_{\\rm model}} $, and a classification layer is denoted as $ W \\in \\mathbb {R}^{K \\times d_{\\rm model}}$, where $K$ is number of classification labels. Finally, the prediction $P$ of BERT is represented as $P = {\\rm softmax}(CW^T)$.\nModel Description ::: Pre-training Tasks\nIn pre-training, intead of using unidirectional language models, BERT developed two pre-training tasks: (1) Masked LM (cloze test) and (2) Next Sentence Prediction. At the first pre-training task, bidirectional language modeling can be done at this cloze-like pre-training. In detail, 15% tokens of input sequence will be masked at random and model need to predict those masked tokens. The encoder will try to learn contextual representations from every given tokens due to masking tokens at random. Model will not know which part of the input is going to be masked, so that the information of each masked tokens should be inferred by remaining tokens. At Next Sentence Prediction, two sentences concatenated together will be considered as model input. In order to give model a good nature language understanding, knowing relationship between sentence is one of important abilities. When generating input sequences, 50% of time the sentence B is actually followed by sentence A, and rest 50% of the time the sentence B will be picked randomly from dataset, and model need to predict if the sentence B is next sentence of sentence A. That is, the attention information will be shared between sentences. Such sentence-level understanding may have difficulties to be learned at first pre-training task (Masked LM), therefore, the pre-training task (NSP) is developed as second training goal to capture the cross sentence relationship.\nIn this competition, limited by the size of dataset and the challenge in contextual emotion recognition, we consider BERT with both two pre-training tasks can give a good starting point to extract emotion changing during dialogue-like conversation. Especially the second pre-training task, it might be more important for dialogue-like conversation where the emotion may various by the context of continuous utterances. That is, given a set of continues conversations, the emotion of current utterance might be influenced by previous utterance. By this assumption and with supporting from the experiment results of BERT, we can take sentence A as one-sentence context and consider sentence B as the target sentence for emotion prediction. The detail will be described in Section SECREF4.\nMethodology\nThe main goal of the present work is to predict the emotion of utterance within the dialogue. Following are four major difficulties we concern about:\nThe emotion of the utterances depends not only on the text but also on the interaction happened earlier.\nThe source of the two datasets are different. Friends is speech-based dialogues and EmotionPush is chat-based dialogues. It makes datasets possess different characteristics.\nThere are only $1,000$ dialogues in both training datasets which are not large enough for the stability of training a complex neural-based model.\nThe prediction targets (emotion labels) are highly unbalanced.\nThe proposed approach is summarized in Figure FIGREF3, which aims to overcome these challenges. The framework could be separated into three steps and described as follow:\nMethodology ::: Causal Utterance Modeling\nGiven a dialogue $D^{(i)}$ which includes sequence of utterances denoted as $D^{(i)}=(u^{(i)}_{1}, u^{(i)}_{2}, ..., u^{(i)}_{n})$, where $i$ is the index in dataset and $n$ is the number of utterances in the given dialogue. In order to conserve the emotional information of both utterance and conversation, we rearrange each two consecutive utterances $u_{t}, u_{t-1}$ into a single sentence representation $x_{t}$ as\nThe corresponding sentence representation corpus $X^{(i)}$ are denoted as $X^{(i)}=(x^{(i)}_{1}, x^{(i)}_{2}, ..., x^{(i)}_{n})$. Note that the first utterance within a conversation does not have its causal utterance (previous sentence), therefore, the causal utterance will be set as [None]. A practical example of sentence representation is shown in Table TABREF11.\nSince the characteristics of two datasets are not identical, we customize different causal utterance modeling strategies to refine the information in text.\nFor Friends, there are two specific properties. The first one is that most dialogues are surrounding with the six main characters, including Rachel, Monica, Phoebe, Joey, Chandler, and Ross. The utterance ratio of given by the six roles is up to $83.4\\%$. Second, the personal characteristics of the six characters are very clear. Each leading role has its own emotion undulated rule. To make use of these features, we introduce the personality tokenization which help learning the personality of the six characters. Personality tokenization concatenate the speaker and says tokens before the input utterance if the speaker is one of the six characters. The example is shown in Table TABREF12.\nFor EmotionPush, the text are informal chats which including like slang, acronym, typo, hyperlink, and emoji. Another characteristic is that the specific name entities are tokenized with random index. (e.g. \u201corganization_80\u201d, \u201cperson_01\u201d, and \u201ctime_12\u201d). We consider some of these informal text are related to expressing emotion such as repeated typing, purposed capitalization, and emoji (e.g. \u201c:D\u201d, \u201c:(\u201d, and \u201c<3\u201d)). Therefore, we keep most informal expressions but only process hyperlinks, empty utterance, and name entities by unifying the tokens.\nMethodology ::: Model Pre-training\nSince the size of both datasets are not large enough for complex neural-based model training as well as BERT model is only pre-train on formal text datasets, the issues of overfitting and domain bias are important considerations for design the pre-training process.\nTo avoid our model overfitting on the training data and increase the understanding of informal text, we adapted BERT and derived two models, namely FriendsBERT and ChatBERT, with different pre-training tasks before the formal training process for Friends and EmotionPush dataset, respectively. The pre-training strategies are described below.\nFor pre-training FriendsBERT, we collect the completed scripts of all ten seasons of Friends TV shows from emorynlp which includes 3,107 scenes within 61,309 utterances. All the utterances are followed the preprocessing methods mentions above to compose the corpus for Masked language model pre-training task. The consequent utterances in the same scenes are considered as the consequent sentences to pre-train the Next Sentence Prediction task. In the pre-training process, the training loss is the sum of the mean likelihood of two pre-train tasks.\nFor pre-training ChatBERT, we pre-train our model on the Twitter dataset, since the text and writing style on Twitter are close to the chat text where both may involved with many informal words or emoticons as well. The Twitter emotion dataset, 8 basic emotions from emotion wheel BIBREF1, was collected by twitter streaming API with specific emotion-related hashtags, such as #anger, #joy, #cry, #sad and etc. The hashtags in tweets are treated as emotion label for model fine-tuning. The tweets were fine-grined processing followed the rules in BIBREF9, BIBREF4, including duplicate tweets removing, the emotion hashtags must appearing in the last position of a tweet, and etc. The statis of tweets were summarized in Table TABREF17. Each tweet and corresponding emotion label composes an emotion classification dataset for pre-training.\nMethodology ::: Fine-tuning\nSince our emotion recognition task is treated as a sequence-level classification task, the model would be fine-tuned on the processed training data. Following the BERT construction, we take the first embedding vector which corresponds to the special token [CLS] from the final hidden state of the Transformer encoder. This vector represents the embedding vector of the corresponding conversation utterances which is denoted as $\\mathbf {C} \\in \\mathbb {R}^{H}$, where $H$ is the embedding size. A dense neural layer is treated as a classification layer which consists of parameters $\\mathbf {W} \\in \\mathbb {R}^{K\\times H}$ and $\\mathbf {b} \\in \\mathbb {R}^{K}$, where $K$ is the number of emotion class. The emotion prediction probabilities $\\mathbf {P} \\in \\mathbb {R}^{K}$ are computed by a softmax activation function as\nAll the parameters in BERT and the classification layer would be fine-turned together to minimize the Negative Log Likelihood (NLL) loss function, as Equation (DISPLAY_FORM22), based on the ground truth emotion label $c$.\nIn order to tackle the problem of highly unbalanced emotion labels, we apply weighted balanced warming on NLL loss function, as Equation (DISPLAY_FORM23), in the first epoch of fine-tuning procedure.\nwhere $\\mathbf {w}$ are the weights of corresponding emotion label $c$ which are computed and normalize by the frequency as\nBy adding the weighted balanced warming on NLL loss, the model could learn to predict the minor emotions (e.g. anger and sadness) earlier and make the training process more stable. Since the major evaluation metrics micro F1-score is effect by the number of each label, we only apply the weighted balanced warming in first epoch to optimize the performance.\nExperiments\nSince the EmotionX challenge only provided the gold labels in training data, we pick the best performance model (weights) to predict the testing data. In this section, we present the experiment and evaluation results.\nExperiments ::: Experimental Setup\nThe EmotionX challenge consists of $1,000$ dialogues for both Friends and EmotionPush. In all of our experiments, each dataset is separated into top 800 dialogues for training and last 200 dialogues for validation. Since the EmotionX challenge considers only the four emotions (anger, joy, neutral, and sadness) in the evaluation stage, we ignore all the data point corresponding to other emotions directly. The details of emotions distribution are shown in Table TABREF18.\nThe hyperparameters and training setup of our models (FriendsBERT and ChatBERT) are shown in Table TABREF25. Some common and easily implemented methods are selected as the baselines embedding methods and classification models. The baseline embedding methods are including bag-of-words (BOW), term frequency\u2013inverse document frequency (TFIDF), and neural-based word embedding. The classification models are including Logistic Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF), TextCNN BIBREF10 with initial word embedding as GloVe BIBREF11, and our proposed model. All the experiment results are based on the best performances of validation results.\nExperiments ::: Performance\nThe experiment results of validation on Friends are shown in Table TABREF19. The proposed model and baselines are evaluated based on the Precision (P.), Recall (R.), and F1-measure (F1).\nFor the traditional baselines, namely BOW and TFIDF, we observe that they achieve surprising high F1 scores around $0.81$, however, the scores for Anger and Sadness are lower. This explains that traditional approaches tend to predict the labels with large sample size, such as Joy and Neutral, but fail to take of scarce samples even when an ensemble random forest classifier is adopted. In order to prevent the unbalanced learning, we choose the weighted loss mechanism for both TextCNN and causal modeling TextCNN (C-TextCNN), these models suffer less than the traditional baselines and achieve a slightly balance performance, where there are around 15% and 7% improvement on Anger and Sadness, respectively. We following adopt the casual utterance modeling to original TextCNN, mapping previous utterance as well as target utterance into model. The causal utterance modeling improve the C-TextCNN over TextCNN for 6%, 2% and 1% on Anger, Joy and overall F1 score. Motivated from these preliminary experiments, the proposed FriendsBERT also adopt the ideas of both weighted loss and causal utterance modeling. As compared to the original BERT, single sentence BERT (FriendsBERT-base-s), the proposed FriendsBERT-base improve 1% for Joy and overall F1, and 2% for Sadness. For the final validation performance, our proposed approach achieves the highest scores, which are $0.85$ and $0.86$ for FriendsBERT-base and FriendsBERT-large, respectively.\nOverall, the proposed FriendsBERT successfully captures the sentence-level context-awarded information and outperforms all the baselines, which not only achieves high performance on large sample labels, but also on small sample labels. The similar settings are also adapted to EmotionPush dataset for the final evaluation.\nExperiments ::: Evaluation Results\nThe testing dataset consists of 240 dialogues including $3,296$ and $3,536$ utterances in Friends and EmotionPush respectively. We re-train our FriendsBERT and ChatBERT with top 920 training dialogues and predict the evaluation results using the model performing the best validation results. The results are shown in Table TABREF29 and Table TABREF30. The present method achieves $81.5\\%$ and $88.5\\%$ micro F1-score on the testing dataset of Friends and EmotionPush, respectively.\nConclusion and Future work\nIn the present work, we propose FriendsBERT and ChatBERT for the multi-utterance emotion recognition task on EmotionLines dataset. The proposed models are adapted from BERT BIBREF5 with three main improvement during the model training procedure, which are the causal utterance modeling mechanism, specific model pre-training, and adapt weighted loss. The causal utterance modeling takes the advantages of the sentence-level context information during model inference. The specific model pre-training helps to against the bias in different text domain. The weighted loss avoids our model to only predict on large size sample. The effectiveness and generalizability of the proposed methods are demonstrated from the experiments.\nIn future work, we consider to include the conditional probabilistic constraint $P ({\\rm Emo}_{B} | \\hat{\\rm Emo}_{A})$. Model should predict the emotion based on a certain understanding about context emotions. This might be more reasonable for guiding model than just predicting emotion of ${\\rm Sentence}_B$ directly. In addition, due to the limitation of BERT input format, ambiguous number of input sentences is now becoming an important design requirement for our future work. Also, personality embedding development will be another future work of the emotion recognition. The personality embedding will be considered as sentence embedding injected into word embedding, and it seems this additional information can contribute some improvement potentially.\n\n Answer the question based on the above article as concisely as you can, using a single phrase or sentence if possible.

Researchers aim to recognize the emotion behind the text and distribute similar ones into the same group. Establishing an emotion classifier can not only understand each user's feeling but also be extended to various application, for example, the motivation behind a user's interests BIBREF0. Based on releasing of large text corpus on social media and the emotion categories proposed by BIBREF1, BIBREF2, numerous models have provided and achieved fabulous precision so far. For example, DeepMoji BIBREF3 which utilized transfer learning concept to enhance emotions and sarcasm understanding behind the target sentence. CARER BIBREF4 learned contextualized affect representations to make itself more sensitive to rare words and the scenario behind the texts.\nAs methods become mature, text-based emotion detecting applications can be extended from a single utterance to a dialogue contributed by a series of utterances. Table TABREF2 illustrates the difference between single utterance and dialogue emotion recognition. The same utterances in Table TABREF2, even the same person said the same sentence, the emotion it convey may be various, which may depend on different background of the conversation, tone of speaking or personality. Therefore, for emotion detection, the information from preceding utterances in a conversation is relatively critical.\nIn SocialNLP 2019 EmotionX, the challenge is to recognize emotions for all utterances in EmotionLines dataset, a dataset consists of dialogues. According to the needs for considering context at the same time, we develop two classification models, inspired by bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) BIBREF5, FriendsBERT and ChatBERT. In this paper, we introduce our approaches including causal utterance modeling, model pre-training, and fine-turning.\nDataset\nEmotionLines BIBREF6 is a dialogue dataset composed of two subsets, Friends and EmotionPush, according to the source of the dialogues. The former comes from the scripts of the Friends TV sitcom. The other is made up of Facebook messenger chats. Each subset includes $1,000$ English dialogues, and each dialogue can be further divided into a few consecutive utterances. All the utterances are annotated by five annotators on a crowd-sourcing platform (Amazon Mechanical Turk), and the labeling work is only based on the textual content. Annotator votes for one of the seven emotions, namely Ekman\u2019s six basic emotions BIBREF1, plus the neutral. If none of the emotion gets more than three votes, the utterance will be marked as \u201cnon-neutral\u201d.\nFor the datasets, there are properties worth additional mentioning. Although Friends and EmotionPush share the same data format, they are quite different in nature. Friends is a speech-based dataset which is annotated dialogues from the TV sitcom. It means most of the utterances are generated by the a few main characters. The personality of a character often affects the way of speaking, and therefore \u201cwho is the speaker\" might provide extra clues for emotion prediction. In contrast, EmotionPush does not have this trait due to the anonymous mechanism. In addition, features such as typo, hyperlink, and emoji that only appear in chat-based data will need some domain-specific techniques to process.\nIncidentally, the objective of the challenge is to predict the emotion for each utterance. Just, according to EmotionX 2019 specification, there are only four emotions be selected as our label candidates, which are Joy, Sadness, Anger, and Neutral. These emotions will be considered during performance evaluation. The technical detail will also be introduced and discussed in following Section SECREF13 and Section SECREF26.\nModel Description\nFor this challenge, we adapt BERT which is proposed by BIBREF5 to help understand the context at the same time. Technically, BERT, designed on end-to-end architecture, is a deep pre-trained transformer encoder that dynamically provides language representation and BERT already achieved multiple state-of-the-art results on GLUE benchmark BIBREF7 and many tasks. A quick recap for BERT's architecture and its pre-training tasks will be illustrated in the following subsections.\nModel Description ::: Model Architecture\nBERT, the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers, consists of several transformer encoder layers that enable the model to extract very deep language features on both token-level and sentence-level. Each transformer encoder contains multi-head self-attention layers that provide ability to learn multiple attention feature of each word from their bidirectional context. The transformer and its self-attention mechanism are proposed by BIBREF8. This self-attention mechanism can be interpreted as a key-value mapping given query. By given the embedding vector for token input, the query ($Q$), key ($K$) and value ($V$) are produced by the projection from each three parameter matrices where $W^Q \\in \\mathbb {R}^{d_{{\\rm model}} \\times d_{k}}, W^K \\in \\mathbb {R}^{d_{\\rm model} \\times d_{k}}$ and $W^V \\in \\mathbb {R}^{d_{\\rm model} \\times d_{v}}$. The self-attention BIBREF8 is formally represented as:\nThe $ d_k = d_v = d_{\\rm model} = 1024$ in BERT large version and 768 in BERT base version. Once model can extract attention feature, we can extend one self-attention into multi-head self-attention, this extension makes sub-space features can be extracted in same time by this multi-head configuration. Overall, the multi-attention mechanism is adopt for each transformer encoder, and several of encoder layer will be stacked together to form a deep transformer encoder.\nFor the model input, BERT allow us take one sentence as input sequence or two sentences together as one input sequence, and the maximum length of input sequence is 512. The way that BERT was designed is for giving model the sentence-level and token-level understanding. In two sentences case, a special token ([SEP]) will be inserted between two sentences. In addition, the first input token is also a special token ([CLS]), and its corresponding ouput will be vector place for classification during fine-tuning. The outputs of the last encoder layer corresponding to each input token can be treated as word representations for each token, and the word representation of the first token ([CLS]) will be consider as classification (output) representation for further fine-tuning tasks. In BERT, this vector is denoted as $C \\in \\mathbb {R}^{d_{\\rm model}} $, and a classification layer is denoted as $ W \\in \\mathbb {R}^{K \\times d_{\\rm model}}$, where $K$ is number of classification labels. Finally, the prediction $P$ of BERT is represented as $P = {\\rm softmax}(CW^T)$.\nModel Description ::: Pre-training Tasks\nIn pre-training, intead of using unidirectional language models, BERT developed two pre-training tasks: (1) Masked LM (cloze test) and (2) Next Sentence Prediction. At the first pre-training task, bidirectional language modeling can be done at this cloze-like pre-training. In detail, 15% tokens of input sequence will be masked at random and model need to predict those masked tokens. The encoder will try to learn contextual representations from every given tokens due to masking tokens at random. Model will not know which part of the input is going to be masked, so that the information of each masked tokens should be inferred by remaining tokens. At Next Sentence Prediction, two sentences concatenated together will be considered as model input. In order to give model a good nature language understanding, knowing relationship between sentence is one of important abilities. When generating input sequences, 50% of time the sentence B is actually followed by sentence A, and rest 50% of the time the sentence B will be picked randomly from dataset, and model need to predict if the sentence B is next sentence of sentence A. That is, the attention information will be shared between sentences. Such sentence-level understanding may have difficulties to be learned at first pre-training task (Masked LM), therefore, the pre-training task (NSP) is developed as second training goal to capture the cross sentence relationship.\nIn this competition, limited by the size of dataset and the challenge in contextual emotion recognition, we consider BERT with both two pre-training tasks can give a good starting point to extract emotion changing during dialogue-like conversation. Especially the second pre-training task, it might be more important for dialogue-like conversation where the emotion may various by the context of continuous utterances. That is, given a set of continues conversations, the emotion of current utterance might be influenced by previous utterance. By this assumption and with supporting from the experiment results of BERT, we can take sentence A as one-sentence context and consider sentence B as the target sentence for emotion prediction. The detail will be described in Section SECREF4.\nMethodology\nThe main goal of the present work is to predict the emotion of utterance within the dialogue. Following are four major difficulties we concern about:\nThe emotion of the utterances depends not only on the text but also on the interaction happened earlier.\nThe source of the two datasets are different. Friends is speech-based dialogues and EmotionPush is chat-based dialogues. It makes datasets possess different characteristics.\nThere are only $1,000$ dialogues in both training datasets which are not large enough for the stability of training a complex neural-based model.\nThe prediction targets (emotion labels) are highly unbalanced.\nThe proposed approach is summarized in Figure FIGREF3, which aims to overcome these challenges. The framework could be separated into three steps and described as follow:\nMethodology ::: Causal Utterance Modeling\nGiven a dialogue $D^{(i)}$ which includes sequence of utterances denoted as $D^{(i)}=(u^{(i)}_{1}, u^{(i)}_{2}, ..., u^{(i)}_{n})$, where $i$ is the index in dataset and $n$ is the number of utterances in the given dialogue. In order to conserve the emotional information of both utterance and conversation, we rearrange each two consecutive utterances $u_{t}, u_{t-1}$ into a single sentence representation $x_{t}$ as\nThe corresponding sentence representation corpus $X^{(i)}$ are denoted as $X^{(i)}=(x^{(i)}_{1}, x^{(i)}_{2}, ..., x^{(i)}_{n})$. Note that the first utterance within a conversation does not have its causal utterance (previous sentence), therefore, the causal utterance will be set as [None]. A practical example of sentence representation is shown in Table TABREF11.\nSince the characteristics of two datasets are not identical, we customize different causal utterance modeling strategies to refine the information in text.\nFor Friends, there are two specific properties. The first one is that most dialogues are surrounding with the six main characters, including Rachel, Monica, Phoebe, Joey, Chandler, and Ross. The utterance ratio of given by the six roles is up to $83.4\\%$. Second, the personal characteristics of the six characters are very clear. Each leading role has its own emotion undulated rule. To make use of these features, we introduce the personality tokenization which help learning the personality of the six characters. Personality tokenization concatenate the speaker and says tokens before the input utterance if the speaker is one of the six characters. The example is shown in Table TABREF12.\nFor EmotionPush, the text are informal chats which including like slang, acronym, typo, hyperlink, and emoji. Another characteristic is that the specific name entities are tokenized with random index. (e.g. \u201corganization_80\u201d, \u201cperson_01\u201d, and \u201ctime_12\u201d). We consider some of these informal text are related to expressing emotion such as repeated typing, purposed capitalization, and emoji (e.g. \u201c:D\u201d, \u201c:(\u201d, and \u201c<3\u201d)). Therefore, we keep most informal expressions but only process hyperlinks, empty utterance, and name entities by unifying the tokens.\nMethodology ::: Model Pre-training\nSince the size of both datasets are not large enough for complex neural-based model training as well as BERT model is only pre-train on formal text datasets, the issues of overfitting and domain bias are important considerations for design the pre-training process.\nTo avoid our model overfitting on the training data and increase the understanding of informal text, we adapted BERT and derived two models, namely FriendsBERT and ChatBERT, with different pre-training tasks before the formal training process for Friends and EmotionPush dataset, respectively. The pre-training strategies are described below.\nFor pre-training FriendsBERT, we collect the completed scripts of all ten seasons of Friends TV shows from emorynlp which includes 3,107 scenes within 61,309 utterances. All the utterances are followed the preprocessing methods mentions above to compose the corpus for Masked language model pre-training task. The consequent utterances in the same scenes are considered as the consequent sentences to pre-train the Next Sentence Prediction task. In the pre-training process, the training loss is the sum of the mean likelihood of two pre-train tasks.\nFor pre-training ChatBERT, we pre-train our model on the Twitter dataset, since the text and writing style on Twitter are close to the chat text where both may involved with many informal words or emoticons as well. The Twitter emotion dataset, 8 basic emotions from emotion wheel BIBREF1, was collected by twitter streaming API with specific emotion-related hashtags, such as #anger, #joy, #cry, #sad and etc. The hashtags in tweets are treated as emotion label for model fine-tuning. The tweets were fine-grined processing followed the rules in BIBREF9, BIBREF4, including duplicate tweets removing, the emotion hashtags must appearing in the last position of a tweet, and etc. The statis of tweets were summarized in Table TABREF17. Each tweet and corresponding emotion label composes an emotion classification dataset for pre-training.\nMethodology ::: Fine-tuning\nSince our emotion recognition task is treated as a sequence-level classification task, the model would be fine-tuned on the processed training data. Following the BERT construction, we take the first embedding vector which corresponds to the special token [CLS] from the final hidden state of the Transformer encoder. This vector represents the embedding vector of the corresponding conversation utterances which is denoted as $\\mathbf {C} \\in \\mathbb {R}^{H}$, where $H$ is the embedding size. A dense neural layer is treated as a classification layer which consists of parameters $\\mathbf {W} \\in \\mathbb {R}^{K\\times H}$ and $\\mathbf {b} \\in \\mathbb {R}^{K}$, where $K$ is the number of emotion class. The emotion prediction probabilities $\\mathbf {P} \\in \\mathbb {R}^{K}$ are computed by a softmax activation function as\nAll the parameters in BERT and the classification layer would be fine-turned together to minimize the Negative Log Likelihood (NLL) loss function, as Equation (DISPLAY_FORM22), based on the ground truth emotion label $c$.\nIn order to tackle the problem of highly unbalanced emotion labels, we apply weighted balanced warming on NLL loss function, as Equation (DISPLAY_FORM23), in the first epoch of fine-tuning procedure.\nwhere $\\mathbf {w}$ are the weights of corresponding emotion label $c$ which are computed and normalize by the frequency as\nBy adding the weighted balanced warming on NLL loss, the model could learn to predict the minor emotions (e.g. anger and sadness) earlier and make the training process more stable.

In this section, we present the experiment and evaluation results.\nExperiments ::: Experimental Setup\nThe EmotionX challenge consists of $1,000$ dialogues for both Friends and EmotionPush. In all of our experiments, each dataset is separated into top 800 dialogues for training and last 200 dialogues for validation. Since the EmotionX challenge considers only the four emotions (anger, joy, neutral, and sadness) in the evaluation stage, we ignore all the data point corresponding to other emotions directly. The details of emotions distribution are shown in Table TABREF18.\nThe hyperparameters and training setup of our models (FriendsBERT and ChatBERT) are shown in Table TABREF25. Some common and easily implemented methods are selected as the baselines embedding methods and classification models. The baseline embedding methods are including bag-of-words (BOW), term frequency\u2013inverse document frequency (TFIDF), and neural-based word embedding.

Do not provide any explanation.\n\nArticle: Introduction\nNowadays deep learning techniques outperform the other conventional methods in most of the speech-related tasks. Training robust deep neural networks for each task depends on the availability of powerful processing GPUs, as well as standard and large scale datasets. In text-independent speaker verification, large-scale datasets are available, thanks to the NIST SRE evaluations and other data collection projects such as VoxCeleb BIBREF0.\nIn text-dependent speaker recognition, experiments with end-to-end architectures conducted on large proprietary databases have demonstrated their superiority over traditional approaches BIBREF1. Yet, contrary to text-independent speaker recognition, text-dependent speaker recognition lacks large-scale publicly available databases. The two most well-known datasets are probably RSR2015 BIBREF2 and RedDots BIBREF3. The former contains speech data collected from 300 individuals in a controlled manner, while the latter is used primarily for evaluation rather than training, due to its small number of speakers (only 64). Motivated by this lack of large-scale dataset for text-dependent speaker verification, we chose to proceed with the collection of the DeepMine dataset, which we expect to become a standard benchmark for the task.\nApart from speaker recognition, large amounts of training data are required also for training automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. Such datasets should not only be large in size, they should also be characterized by high variability with respect to speakers, age and dialects. While several datasets with these properties are available for languages like English, Mandarin, French, this is not the case for several other languages, such as Persian. To this end, we proceeded with collecting a large-scale dataset, suitable for building robust ASR models in Persian.\nThe main goal of the DeepMine project was to collect speech from at least a few thousand speakers, enabling research and development of deep learning methods. The project started at the beginning of 2017, and after designing the database and the developing Android and server applications, the data collection began in the middle of 2017. The project finished at the end of 2018 and the cleaned-up and final version of the database was released at the beginning of 2019. In BIBREF4, the running project and its data collection scenarios were described, alongside with some preliminary results and statistics. In this paper, we announce the final and cleaned-up version of the database, describe its different parts and provide various evaluation setups for each part. Finally, since the database was designed mainly for text-dependent speaker verification purposes, some baseline results are reported for this task on the official evaluation setups. Additional baseline results are also reported for Persian speech recognition. However, due to the space limitation in this paper, the baseline results are not reported for all the database parts and conditions. They will be defined and reported in the database technical documentation and in a future journal paper.\nData Collection\nDeepMine is publicly available for everybody with a variety of licenses for different users. It was collected using crowdsourcing BIBREF4. The data collection was done using an Android application. Each respondent installed the application on his/her personal device and recorded several phrases in different sessions. The Android application did various checks on each utterance and if it passed all of them, the respondent was directed to the next phrase. For more information about data collection scenario, please refer to BIBREF4.\nData Collection ::: Post-Processing\nIn order to clean-up the database, the main post-processing step was to filter out problematic utterances. Possible problems include speaker word insertions (e.g. repeating some part of a phrase), deletions, substitutions, and involuntary disfluencies. To detect these, we implemented an alignment stage, similar to the second alignment stage in the LibriSpeech project BIBREF5. In this method, a custom decoding graph was generated for each phrase. The decoding graph allows for word skipping and word insertion in the phrase.\nFor text-dependent and text-prompted parts of the database, such errors are not allowed. Hence, any utterances with errors were removed from the enrollment and test lists. For the speech recognition part, a sub-part of the utterance which is correctly aligned to the corresponding transcription is kept. After the cleaning step, around 190 thousand utterances with full transcription and 10 thousand with sub-part alignment have remained in the database.\nData Collection ::: Statistics\nAfter processing the database and removing problematic respondents and utterances, 1969 respondents remained in the database, with 1149 of them being male and 820 female. 297 of the respondents could not read English and have therefore read only the Persian prompts. About 13200 sessions were recorded by females and similarly, about 9500 sessions by males, i.e. women are over-represented in terms of sessions, even though their number is 17% smaller than that of males. Other useful statistics related to the database are shown in Table TABREF4.\nThe last status of the database, as well as other related and useful information about its availability can be found on its website, together with a limited number of samples.\nDeepMine Database Parts\nThe DeepMine database consists of three parts. The first one contains fixed common phrases to perform text-dependent speaker verification. The second part consists of random sequences of words useful for text-prompted speaker verification, and the last part includes phrases with word- and phoneme-level transcription, useful for text-independent speaker verification using a random phrase (similar to Part4 of RedDots). This part can also serve for Persian ASR training. Each part is described in more details below. Table TABREF11 shows the number of unique phrases in each part of the database. For the English text-dependent part, the following phrases were selected from part1 of the RedDots database, hence the RedDots can be used as an additional training set for this part:\n\u201cMy voice is my password.\u201d\n\u201cOK Google.\u201d\n\u201cArtificial intelligence is for real.\u201d\n\u201cActions speak louder than words.\u201d\n\u201cThere is no such thing as a free lunch.\u201d\nDeepMine Database Parts ::: Part1 - Text-dependent (TD)\nThis part contains a set of fixed phrases which are used to verify speakers in text-dependent mode. Each speaker utters 5 Persian phrases, and if the speaker can read English, 5 phrases selected from Part1 of the RedDots database are also recorded.\nWe have created three experimental setups with different numbers of speakers in the evaluation set. For each setup, speakers with more recording sessions are included in the evaluation set and the rest of the speakers are used for training in the background set (in the database, all background sets are basically training data). The rows in Table TABREF13 corresponds to the different experimental setups and shows the numbers of speakers in each set. Note that, for English, we have filtered the (Persian native) speakers by the ability to read English. Therefore, there are fewer speakers in each set for English than for Persian. There is a small \u201cdev\u201d set in each setup which can be used for parameter tuning to prevent over-tuning on the evaluation set.\nFor each experimental setup, we have defined several official trial lists with different numbers of enrollment utterances per trial in order to investigate the effects of having different amounts of enrollment data. All trials in one trial list have the same number of enrollment utterances (3 to 6) and only one test utterance. All enrollment utterances in a trial are taken from different consecutive sessions and the test utterance is taken from yet another session. From all the setups and conditions, the 100-spk with 3-session enrollment (3-sess) is considered as the main evaluation condition. In Table TABREF14, the number of trials for Persian 3-sess are shown for the different types of trial in the text-dependent speaker verification (SV). Note that for Imposter-Wrong (IW) trials (i.e. imposter speaker pronouncing wrong phrase), we merely create one wrong trial for each Imposter-Correct (IC) trial to limit the huge number of possible trials for this case. So, the number of trials for IC and IW cases are the same.\nDeepMine Database Parts ::: Part2 - Text-prompted (TP)\nFor this part, in each session, 3 random sequences of Persian month names are shown to the respondent in two modes: In the first mode, the sequence consists of all 12 months, which will be used for speaker enrollment. The second mode contains a sequence of 3 month names that will be used as a test utterance. In each 8 sessions received by a respondent from the server, there are 3 enrollment phrases of all 12 months (all in just one session), and $7 \\times 3$ other test phrases, containing fewer words. For a respondent who can read English, 3 random sequences of English digits are also recorded in each session. In one of the sessions, these sequences contain all digits and the remaining ones contain only 4 digits.\nSimilar to the text-dependent case, three experimental setups with different number of speaker in the evaluation set are defined (corresponding to the rows in Table TABREF16). However, different strategy is used for defining trials: Depending on the enrollment condition (1- to 3-sess), trials are enrolled on utterances of all words from 1 to 3 different sessions (i.e. 3 to 9 utterances). Further, we consider two conditions for test utterances: seq test utterance with only 3 or 4 words and full test utterances with all words (i.e. same words as in enrollment but in different order). From all setups an all conditions, the 100-spk with 1-session enrolment (1-sess) is considered as the main evaluation condition for the text-prompted case. In Table TABREF16, the numbers of trials (sum for both seq and full conditions) for Persian 1-sess are shown for the different types of trials in the text-prompted SV. Again, we just create one IW trial for each IC trial.\nDeepMine Database Parts ::: Part3 - Text-independent (TI)\nIn this part, 8 Persian phrases that have already been transcribed on the phone level are displayed to the respondent. These phrases are chosen mostly from news and Persian Wikipedia. If the respondent is unable to read English, instead of 5 fixed phrases and 3 random digit strings, 8 other Persian phrases are also prompted to the respondent to have exactly 24 phrases in each recording session.\nThis part can be useful at least for three potential applications. First, it can be used for text-independent speaker verification. The second application of this part (same as Part4 of RedDots) is text-prompted speaker verification using random text (instead of a random sequence of words). Finally, the third application is large vocabulary speech recognition in Persian (explained in the next sub-section).\nBased on the recording sessions, we created two experimental setups for speaker verification. In the first one, respondents with at least 17 recording sessions are included to the evaluation set, respondents with 16 sessions to the development and the rest of respondents to the background set (can be used as training data). In the second setup, respondents with at least 8 sessions are included to the evaluation set, respondents with 6 or 7 sessions to the development and the rest of respondents to the background set. Table TABREF18 shows numbers of speakers in each set of the database for text-independent SV case.\nFor text-independent SV, we have considered 4 scenarios for enrollment and 4 scenarios for test. The speaker can be enrolled using utterances from 1, 2 or 3 consecutive sessions (1sess to 3sess) or using 8 utterances from 8 different sessions. The test speech can be one utterance (1utt) for short duration scenario or all utterances in one session (1sess) for long duration case. In addition, test speech can be selected from 5 English phrases for cross-language testing (enrollment using Persian utterances and test using English utterances). From all setups, 1sess-1utt and 1sess-1sess for 438-spk set are considered as the main evaluation setups for text-independent case. Table TABREF19 shows number of trials for these setups.\nFor text-prompted SV with random text, the same setup as text-independent case together with corresponding utterance transcriptions can be used.\nDeepMine Database Parts ::: Part3 - Speech Recognition\nAs explained before, Part3 of the DeepMine database can be used for Persian read speech recognition. There are only a few databases for speech recognition in Persian BIBREF6, BIBREF7. Hence, this part can at least partly address this problem and enable robust speech recognition applications in Persian. Additionally, it can be used for speaker recognition applications, such as training deep neural networks (DNNs) for extracting bottleneck features BIBREF8, or for collecting sufficient statistics using DNNs for i-vector training.\nWe have randomly selected 50 speakers (25 for each gender) from the all speakers in the database which have net speech (without silence parts) between 25 minutes to 50 minutes as test speakers. For each speaker, the utterances in the first 5 sessions are included to (small) test-set and the other utterances of test speakers are considered as a large-test-set. The remaining utterances of the other speakers are included in the training set. The test-set, large-test-set and train-set contain 5.9, 28.5 and 450 hours of speech respectively.\nThere are about 8300 utterances in Part3 which contain only Persian full names (i.e. first and family name pairs). Each phrase consists of several full names and their phoneme transcriptions were extracted automatically using a trained Grapheme-to-Phoneme (G2P). These utterances can be used to evaluate the performance of a systems for name recognition, which is usually more difficult than the normal speech recognition because of the lack of a reliable language model.\nExperiments and Results\nDue to the space limitation, we present results only for the Persian text-dependent speaker verification and speech recognition.\nExperiments and Results ::: Speaker Verification Experiments\nWe conducted an experiment on text-dependent speaker verification part of the database, using the i-vector based method proposed in BIBREF9, BIBREF10 and applied it to the Persian portion of Part1. In this experiment, 20-dimensional MFCC features along with first and second derivatives are extracted from 16 kHz signals using HTK BIBREF11 with 25 ms Hamming windowed frames with 15 ms overlap.\nThe reported results are obtained with a 400-dimensional gender independent i-vector based system. The i-vectors are first length-normalized and are further normalized using phrase- and gender-dependent Regularized Within-Class Covariance Normalization (RWCCN) BIBREF10. Cosine distance is used to obtain speaker verification scores and phrase- and gender-dependent s-norm is used for normalizing the scores. For aligning speech frames to Gaussian components, monophone HMMs with 3 states and 8 Gaussian components in each state are used BIBREF10. We only model the phonemes which appear in the 5 Persian text-dependent phrases.\nFor speaker verification experiments, the results were reported in terms of Equal Error Rate (EER) and Normalized Detection Cost Function as defined for NIST SRE08 ($\\mathrm {NDCF_{0.01}^{min}}$) and NIST SRE10 ($\\mathrm {NDCF_{0.001}^{min}}$). As shown in Table TABREF22, in text-dependent SV there are 4 types of trials: Target-Correct and Imposter-Correct refer to trials when the pass-phrase is uttered correctly by target and imposter speakers respectively, and in same manner, Target-Wrong and Imposter-Wrong refer to trials when speakers uttered a wrong pass-phrase. In this paper, only the correct trials (i.e. Target-Correct as target trials vs Imposter-Correct as non-target trials) are considered for evaluating systems as it has been proved that these are the most challenging trials in text-dependent SV BIBREF8, BIBREF12.\nTable TABREF23 shows the results of text-dependent experiments using Persian 100-spk and 3-sess setup. For filtering trials, the respondents' mobile brand and model were used in this experiment. In the table, the first two letters in the filter notation relate to the target trials and the second two letters (i.e. right side of the colon) relate for non-target trials. For target trials, the first Y means the enrolment and test utterances were recorded using a device with the same brand by the target speaker. The second Y letter means both recordings were done using exactly the same device model. Similarly, the first Y for non-target trials means that the devices of target and imposter speakers are from the same brand (i.e. manufacturer). The second Y means that, in addition to the same brand, both devices have the same model. So, the most difficult target trials are \u201cNN\u201d, where the speaker has used different a device at the test time. In the same manner, the most difficult non-target trials which should be rejected by the system are \u201cYY\u201d where the imposter speaker has used the same device model as the target speaker (note that it does not mean physically the same device because each speaker participated in the project using a personal mobile device). Hence, the similarity in the recording channel makes rejection more difficult.\nThe first row in Table TABREF23 shows the results for all trials. By comparing the results with the best published results on RSR2015 and RedDots BIBREF10, BIBREF8, BIBREF12, it is clear that the DeepMine database is more challenging than both RSR2015 and RedDots databases. For RSR2015, the same i-vector/HMM-based method with both RWCCN and s-norm has achieved EER less than 0.3% for both genders (Table VI in BIBREF10). The conventional Relevance MAP adaptation with HMM alignment without applying any channel-compensation techniques (i.e. without applying RWCCN and s-norm due to the lack of suitable training data) on RedDots Part1 for the male has achieved EER around 1.5% (Table XI in BIBREF10). It is worth noting that EERs for DeepMine database without any channel-compensation techniques are 2.1 and 3.7% for males and females respectively.\nOne interesting advantage of the DeepMine database compared to both RSR2015 and RedDots is having several target speakers with more than one mobile device. This is allows us to analyse the effects of channel compensation methods. The second row in Table TABREF23 corresponds to the most difficult trials where the target trials come from mobile devices with different models while imposter trials come from the same device models. It is clear that severe degradation was caused by this kind of channel effects (i.e. decreasing within-speaker similarities while increasing between-speaker similarities), especially for females.\nThe results in the third row show the condition when target speakers at the test time use exactly the same device that was used for enrollment. Comparing this row with the results in the first row proves how much improvement can be achieved when exactly the same device is used by the target speaker.\nThe results in the fourth row show the condition when imposter speakers also use the same device model at test time to fool the system. So, in this case, there is no device mismatch in all trials. By comparing the results with the third row, we can see how much degradation is caused if we only consider the non-target trials with the same device.\nThe fifth row shows similar results when the imposter speakers use device of the same brand as the target speaker but with a different model. Surprisingly, in this case, the degradation is negligible and it means that mobiles from a specific brand (manufacturer) have different recording channel properties.\nThe degraded female results in the sixth row as compared to the third row show the effect of using a different device model from the same brand for target trials. For males, the filters brings almost the same subsets of trials, which explains the very similar results in this case.\nLooking at the first two and the last row of Table TABREF23, one can notice the significantly worse performance obtained for the female trials as compared to males. Note that these three rows include target trials where the devices used for enrollment do not necessarily match the devices used for recording test utterances. On the other hand, in rows 3 to 6, which exclude such mismatched trials, the performance for males and females is comparable. This suggest that the degraded results for females are caused by some problematic trials with device mismatch. The exact reason for this degradation is so far unclear and needs a further investigation.\nIn the last row of the table, the condition of the second row is relaxed: the target device should have different model possibly from the same brand and imposter device only needs to be from the same brand. In this case, as was expected, the performance degradation is smaller than in the second row.\nExperiments and Results ::: Speech Recognition Experiments\nIn addition to speaker verification, we present several speech recognition experiments on Part3. The experiments were performed with the Kaldi toolkit BIBREF13. For training HMM-based MonoPhone model, only 20 thousands of shortest utterances are used and for other models the whole training data is used. The DNN based acoustic model is a time-delay DNN with low-rank factorized layers and skip connections without i-vector adaptation (a modified network from one of the best performing LibriSpeech recipes). The network is shown in Table TABREF25: there are 16 F-TDNN layers, with dimension 1536 and linear bottleneck layers of dimension 256. The acoustic model is trained for 10 epochs using lattice-free maximum mutual information (LF-MMI) with cross-entropy regularization BIBREF14. Re-scoring is done using a pruned trigram language model and the size of the dictionary is around 90,000 words.\nTable TABREF26 shows the results in terms of word error rate (WER) for different evaluated methods. As can be seen, the created database can be used to train well performing and practically usable Persian ASR models.\nConclusions\nIn this paper, we have described the final version of a large speech corpus, the DeepMine database. It has been collected using crowdsourcing and, according to the best of our knowledge, it is the largest public text-dependent and text-prompted speaker verification database in two languages: Persian and English. In addition, it is the largest text-independent speaker verification evaluation database, making it suitable to robustly evaluate state-of-the-art methods on different conditions. Alongside these appealing properties, it comes with phone-level transcription, making it suitable to train deep neural network models for Persian speech recognition.\nWe provided several evaluation protocols for each part of the database. The protocols allow researchers to investigate the performance of different methods in various scenarios and study the effects of channels, duration and phrase text on the performance. We also provide two test sets for speech recognition: One normal test set with a few minutes of speech for each speaker and one large test set with more (30 minutes on average) speech that can be used for any speaker adaptation method.\nAs baseline results, we reported the performance of an i-vector/HMM based method on Persian text-dependent part. Moreover, we conducted speech recognition experiments using conventional HMM-based methods, as well as state-of-the-art deep neural network based method using Kaldi toolkit with promising performance. Text-dependent results have shown that the DeepMine database is more challenging than RSR2015 and RedDots databases.\nAcknowledgments\nThe data collection project was mainly supported by Sharif DeepMine company.

Training robust deep neural networks for each task depends on the availability of powerful processing GPUs, as well as standard and large scale datasets. In text-independent speaker verification, large-scale datasets are available, thanks to the NIST SRE evaluations and other data collection projects such as VoxCeleb BIBREF0.\nIn text-dependent speaker recognition, experiments with end-to-end architectures conducted on large proprietary databases have demonstrated their superiority over traditional approaches BIBREF1. Yet, contrary to text-independent speaker recognition, text-dependent speaker recognition lacks large-scale publicly available databases. The two most well-known datasets are probably RSR2015 BIBREF2 and RedDots BIBREF3. The former contains speech data collected from 300 individuals in a controlled manner, while the latter is used primarily for evaluation rather than training, due to its small number of speakers (only 64). Motivated by this lack of large-scale dataset for text-dependent speaker verification, we chose to proceed with the collection of the DeepMine dataset, which we expect to become a standard benchmark for the task.\nApart from speaker recognition, large amounts of training data are required also for training automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. Such datasets should not only be large in size, they should also be characterized by high variability with respect to speakers, age and dialects. While several datasets with these properties are available for languages like English, Mandarin, French, this is not the case for several other languages, such as Persian. To this end, we proceeded with collecting a large-scale dataset, suitable for building robust ASR models in Persian.\nThe main goal of the DeepMine project was to collect speech from at least a few thousand speakers, enabling research and development of deep learning methods. The project started at the beginning of 2017, and after designing the database and the developing Android and server applications, the data collection began in the middle of 2017. The project finished at the end of 2018 and the cleaned-up and final version of the database was released at the beginning of 2019. In BIBREF4, the running project and its data collection scenarios were described, alongside with some preliminary results and statistics. In this paper, we announce the final and cleaned-up version of the database, describe its different parts and provide various evaluation setups for each part. Finally, since the database was designed mainly for text-dependent speaker verification purposes, some baseline results are reported for this task on the official evaluation setups. Additional baseline results are also reported for Persian speech recognition. However, due to the space limitation in this paper, the baseline results are not reported for all the database parts and conditions. They will be defined and reported in the database technical documentation and in a future journal paper.\nData Collection\nDeepMine is publicly available for everybody with a variety of licenses for different users. It was collected using crowdsourcing BIBREF4. The data collection was done using an Android application. Each respondent installed the application on his/her personal device and recorded several phrases in different sessions. The Android application did various checks on each utterance and if it passed all of them, the respondent was directed to the next phrase. For more information about data collection scenario, please refer to BIBREF4.\nData Collection ::: Post-Processing\nIn order to clean-up the database, the main post-processing step was to filter out problematic utterances. Possible problems include speaker word insertions (e.g. repeating some part of a phrase), deletions, substitutions, and involuntary disfluencies. To detect these, we implemented an alignment stage, similar to the second alignment stage in the LibriSpeech project BIBREF5. In this method, a custom decoding graph was generated for each phrase. The decoding graph allows for word skipping and word insertion in the phrase.\nFor text-dependent and text-prompted parts of the database, such errors are not allowed. Hence, any utterances with errors were removed from the enrollment and test lists. For the speech recognition part, a sub-part of the utterance which is correctly aligned to the corresponding transcription is kept. After the cleaning step, around 190 thousand utterances with full transcription and 10 thousand with sub-part alignment have remained in the database.\nData Collection ::: Statistics\nAfter processing the database and removing problematic respondents and utterances, 1969 respondents remained in the database, with 1149 of them being male and 820 female. 297 of the respondents could not read English and have therefore read only the Persian prompts. About 13200 sessions were recorded by females and similarly, about 9500 sessions by males, i.e. women are over-represented in terms of sessions, even though their number is 17% smaller than that of males. Other useful statistics related to the database are shown in Table TABREF4.\nThe last status of the database, as well as other related and useful information about its availability can be found on its website, together with a limited number of samples.\nDeepMine Database Parts\nThe DeepMine database consists of three parts. The first one contains fixed common phrases to perform text-dependent speaker verification. The second part consists of random sequences of words useful for text-prompted speaker verification, and the last part includes phrases with word- and phoneme-level transcription, useful for text-independent speaker verification using a random phrase (similar to Part4 of RedDots). This part can also serve for Persian ASR training. Each part is described in more details below. Table TABREF11 shows the number of unique phrases in each part of the database. For the English text-dependent part, the following phrases were selected from part1 of the RedDots database, hence the RedDots can be used as an additional training set for this part:\n\u201cMy voice is my password.\u201d\n\u201cOK Google.\u201d\n\u201cArtificial intelligence is for real.\u201d\n\u201cActions speak louder than words.\u201d\n\u201cThere is no such thing as a free lunch.\u201d\nDeepMine Database Parts ::: Part1 - Text-dependent (TD)\nThis part contains a set of fixed phrases which are used to verify speakers in text-dependent mode. Each speaker utters 5 Persian phrases, and if the speaker can read English, 5 phrases selected from Part1 of the RedDots database are also recorded.\nWe have created three experimental setups with different numbers of speakers in the evaluation set. For each setup, speakers with more recording sessions are included in the evaluation set and the rest of the speakers are used for training in the background set (in the database, all background sets are basically training data). The rows in Table TABREF13 corresponds to the different experimental setups and shows the numbers of speakers in each set. Note that, for English, we have filtered the (Persian native) speakers by the ability to read English. Therefore, there are fewer speakers in each set for English than for Persian. There is a small \u201cdev\u201d set in each setup which can be used for parameter tuning to prevent over-tuning on the evaluation set.\nFor each experimental setup, we have defined several official trial lists with different numbers of enrollment utterances per trial in order to investigate the effects of having different amounts of enrollment data. All trials in one trial list have the same number of enrollment utterances (3 to 6) and only one test utterance. All enrollment utterances in a trial are taken from different consecutive sessions and the test utterance is taken from yet another session. From all the setups and conditions, the 100-spk with 3-session enrollment (3-sess) is considered as the main evaluation condition. In Table TABREF14, the number of trials for Persian 3-sess are shown for the different types of trial in the text-dependent speaker verification (SV). Note that for Imposter-Wrong (IW) trials (i.e. imposter speaker pronouncing wrong phrase), we merely create one wrong trial for each Imposter-Correct (IC) trial to limit the huge number of possible trials for this case. So, the number of trials for IC and IW cases are the same.\nDeepMine Database Parts ::: Part2 - Text-prompted (TP)\nFor this part, in each session, 3 random sequences of Persian month names are shown to the respondent in two modes: In the first mode, the sequence consists of all 12 months, which will be used for speaker enrollment. The second mode contains a sequence of 3 month names that will be used as a test utterance. In each 8 sessions received by a respondent from the server, there are 3 enrollment phrases of all 12 months (all in just one session), and $7 \\times 3$ other test phrases, containing fewer words. For a respondent who can read English, 3 random sequences of English digits are also recorded in each session. In one of the sessions, these sequences contain all digits and the remaining ones contain only 4 digits.\nSimilar to the text-dependent case, three experimental setups with different number of speaker in the evaluation set are defined (corresponding to the rows in Table TABREF16). However, different strategy is used for defining trials: Depending on the enrollment condition (1- to 3-sess), trials are enrolled on utterances of all words from 1 to 3 different sessions (i.e. 3 to 9 utterances). Further, we consider two conditions for test utterances: seq test utterance with only 3 or 4 words and full test utterances with all words (i.e. same words as in enrollment but in different order). From all setups an all conditions, the 100-spk with 1-session enrolment (1-sess) is considered as the main evaluation condition for the text-prompted case. In Table TABREF16, the numbers of trials (sum for both seq and full conditions) for Persian 1-sess are shown for the different types of trials in the text-prompted SV. Again, we just create one IW trial for each IC trial.\nDeepMine Database Parts ::: Part3 - Text-independent (TI)\nIn this part, 8 Persian phrases that have already been transcribed on the phone level are displayed to the respondent. These phrases are chosen mostly from news and Persian Wikipedia. If the respondent is unable to read English, instead of 5 fixed phrases and 3 random digit strings, 8 other Persian phrases are also prompted to the respondent to have exactly 24 phrases in each recording session.\nThis part can be useful at least for three potential applications. First, it can be used for text-independent speaker verification. The second application of this part (same as Part4 of RedDots) is text-prompted speaker verification using random text (instead of a random sequence of words). Finally, the third application is large vocabulary speech recognition in Persian (explained in the next sub-section).\nBased on the recording sessions, we created two experimental setups for speaker verification. In the first one, respondents with at least 17 recording sessions are included to the evaluation set, respondents with 16 sessions to the development and the rest of respondents to the background set (can be used as training data). In the second setup, respondents with at least 8 sessions are included to the evaluation set, respondents with 6 or 7 sessions to the development and the rest of respondents to the background set. Table TABREF18 shows numbers of speakers in each set of the database for text-independent SV case.\nFor text-independent SV, we have considered 4 scenarios for enrollment and 4 scenarios for test. The speaker can be enrolled using utterances from 1, 2 or 3 consecutive sessions (1sess to 3sess) or using 8 utterances from 8 different sessions. The test speech can be one utterance (1utt) for short duration scenario or all utterances in one session (1sess) for long duration case. In addition, test speech can be selected from 5 English phrases for cross-language testing (enrollment using Persian utterances and test using English utterances). From all setups, 1sess-1utt and 1sess-1sess for 438-spk set are considered as the main evaluation setups for text-independent case. Table TABREF19 shows number of trials for these setups.\nFor text-prompted SV with random text, the same setup as text-independent case together with corresponding utterance transcriptions can be used.\nDeepMine Database Parts ::: Part3 - Speech Recognition\nAs explained before, Part3 of the DeepMine database can be used for Persian read speech recognition. There are only a few databases for speech recognition in Persian BIBREF6, BIBREF7. Hence, this part can at least partly address this problem and enable robust speech recognition applications in Persian. Additionally, it can be used for speaker recognition applications, such as training deep neural networks (DNNs) for extracting bottleneck features BIBREF8, or for collecting sufficient statistics using DNNs for i-vector training.\nWe have randomly selected 50 speakers (25 for each gender) from the all speakers in the database which have net speech (without silence parts) between 25 minutes to 50 minutes as test speakers. For each speaker, the utterances in the first 5 sessions are included to (small) test-set and the other utterances of test speakers are considered as a large-test-set. The remaining utterances of the other speakers are included in the training set. The test-set, large-test-set and train-set contain 5.9, 28.5 and 450 hours of speech respectively.\nThere are about 8300 utterances in Part3 which contain only Persian full names (i.e. first and family name pairs). Each phrase consists of several full names and their phoneme transcriptions were extracted automatically using a trained Grapheme-to-Phoneme (G2P). These utterances can be used to evaluate the performance of a systems for name recognition, which is usually more difficult than the normal speech recognition because of the lack of a reliable language model.\nExperiments and Results\nDue to the space limitation, we present results only for the Persian text-dependent speaker verification and speech recognition.\nExperiments and Results ::: Speaker Verification Experiments\nWe conducted an experiment on text-dependent speaker verification part of the database, using the i-vector based method proposed in BIBREF9, BIBREF10 and applied it to the Persian portion of Part1. In this experiment, 20-dimensional MFCC features along with first and second derivatives are extracted from 16 kHz signals using HTK BIBREF11 with 25 ms Hamming windowed frames with 15 ms overlap.\nThe reported results are obtained with a 400-dimensional gender independent i-vector based system. The i-vectors are first length-normalized and are further normalized using phrase- and gender-dependent Regularized Within-Class Covariance Normalization (RWCCN) BIBREF10. Cosine distance is used to obtain speaker verification scores and phrase- and gender-dependent s-norm is used for normalizing the scores. For aligning speech frames to Gaussian components, monophone HMMs with 3 states and 8 Gaussian components in each state are used BIBREF10. We only model the phonemes which appear in the 5 Persian text-dependent phrases.\nFor speaker verification experiments, the results were reported in terms of Equal Error Rate (EER) and Normalized Detection Cost Function as defined for NIST SRE08 ($\\mathrm {NDCF_{0.01}^{min}}$) and NIST SRE10 ($\\mathrm {NDCF_{0.001}^{min}}$). As shown in Table TABREF22, in text-dependent SV there are 4 types of trials: Target-Correct and Imposter-Correct refer to trials when the pass-phrase is uttered correctly by target and imposter speakers respectively, and in same manner, Target-Wrong and Imposter-Wrong refer to trials when speakers uttered a wrong pass-phrase. In this paper, only the correct trials (i.e. Target-Correct as target trials vs Imposter-Correct as non-target trials) are considered for evaluating systems as it has been proved that these are the most challenging trials in text-dependent SV BIBREF8, BIBREF12.\nTable TABREF23 shows the results of text-dependent experiments using Persian 100-spk and 3-sess setup. For filtering trials, the respondents' mobile brand and model were used in this experiment. In the table, the first two letters in the filter notation relate to the target trials and the second two letters (i.e. right side of the colon) relate for non-target trials. For target trials, the first Y means the enrolment and test utterances were recorded using a device with the same brand by the target speaker. The second Y letter means both recordings were done using exactly the same device model. Similarly, the first Y for non-target trials means that the devices of target and imposter speakers are from the same brand (i.e. manufacturer). The second Y means that, in addition to the same brand, both devices have the same model. So, the most difficult target trials are \u201cNN\u201d, where the speaker has used different a device at the test time. In the same manner, the most difficult non-target trials which should be rejected by the system are \u201cYY\u201d where the imposter speaker has used the same device model as the target speaker (note that it does not mean physically the same device because each speaker participated in the project using a personal mobile device). Hence, the similarity in the recording channel makes rejection more difficult.\nThe first row in Table TABREF23 shows the results for all trials. By comparing the results with the best published results on RSR2015 and RedDots BIBREF10, BIBREF8, BIBREF12, it is clear that the DeepMine database is more challenging than both RSR2015 and RedDots databases. For RSR2015, the same i-vector/HMM-based method with both RWCCN and s-norm has achieved EER less than 0.3% for both genders (Table VI in BIBREF10). The conventional Relevance MAP adaptation with HMM alignment without applying any channel-compensation techniques (i.e. without applying RWCCN and s-norm due to the lack of suitable training data) on RedDots Part1 for the male has achieved EER around 1.5% (Table XI in BIBREF10). It is worth noting that EERs for DeepMine database without any channel-compensation techniques are 2.1 and 3.7% for males and females respectively.\nOne interesting advantage of the DeepMine database compared to both RSR2015 and RedDots is having several target speakers with more than one mobile device. This is allows us to analyse the effects of channel compensation methods. The second row in Table TABREF23 corresponds to the most difficult trials where the target trials come from mobile devices with different models while imposter trials come from the same device models. It is clear that severe degradation was caused by this kind of channel effects (i.e. decreasing within-speaker similarities while increasing between-speaker similarities), especially for females.\nThe results in the third row show the condition when target speakers at the test time use exactly the same device that was used for enrollment. Comparing this row with the results in the first row proves how much improvement can be achieved when exactly the same device is used by the target speaker.\nThe results in the fourth row show the condition when imposter speakers also use the same device model at test time to fool the system. So, in this case, there is no device mismatch in all trials. By comparing the results with the third row, we can see how much degradation is caused if we only consider the non-target trials with the same device.\nThe fifth row shows similar results when the imposter speakers use device of the same brand as the target speaker but with a different model. Surprisingly, in this case, the degradation is negligible and it means that mobiles from a specific brand (manufacturer) have different recording channel properties.\nThe degraded female results in the sixth row as compared to the third row show the effect of using a different device model from the same brand for target trials. For males, the filters brings almost the same subsets of trials, which explains the very similar results in this case.\nLooking at the first two and the last row of Table TABREF23, one can notice the significantly worse performance obtained for the female trials as compared to males. Note that these three rows include target trials where the devices used for enrollment do not necessarily match the devices used for recording test utterances. On the other hand, in rows 3 to 6, which exclude such mismatched trials, the performance for males and females is comparable. This suggest that the degraded results for females are caused by some problematic trials with device mismatch. The exact reason for this degradation is so far unclear and needs a further investigation.\nIn the last row of the table, the condition of the second row is relaxed: the target device should have different model possibly from the same brand and imposter device only needs to be from the same brand. In this case, as was expected, the performance degradation is smaller than in the second row.\nExperiments and Results ::: Speech Recognition Experiments\nIn addition to speaker verification, we present several speech recognition experiments on Part3. The experiments were performed with the Kaldi toolkit BIBREF13. For training HMM-based MonoPhone model, only 20 thousands of shortest utterances are used and for other models the whole training data is used. The DNN based acoustic model is a time-delay DNN with low-rank factorized layers and skip connections without i-vector adaptation (a modified network from one of the best performing LibriSpeech recipes). The network is shown in Table TABREF25: there are 16 F-TDNN layers, with dimension 1536 and linear bottleneck layers of dimension 256. The acoustic model is trained for 10 epochs using lattice-free maximum mutual information (LF-MMI) with cross-entropy regularization BIBREF14. Re-scoring is done using a pruned trigram language model and the size of the dictionary is around 90,000 words.\nTable TABREF26 shows the results in terms of word error rate (WER) for different evaluated methods. As can be seen, the created database can be used to train well performing and practically usable Persian ASR models.\nConclusions\nIn this paper, we have described the final version of a large speech corpus, the DeepMine database. It has been collected using crowdsourcing and, according to the best of our knowledge, it is the largest public text-dependent and text-prompted speaker verification database in two languages: Persian and English. In addition, it is the largest text-independent speaker verification evaluation database, making it suitable to robustly evaluate state-of-the-art methods on different conditions. Alongside these appealing properties, it comes with phone-level transcription, making it suitable to train deep neural network models for Persian speech recognition.\nWe provided several evaluation protocols for each part of the database. The protocols allow researchers to investigate the performance of different methods in various scenarios and study the effects of channels, duration and phrase text on the performance. We also provide two test sets for speech recognition: One normal test set with a few minutes of speech for each speaker and one large test set with more (30 minutes on average) speech that can be used for any speaker adaptation method.\nAs baseline results, we reported the performance of an i-vector/HMM based method on Persian text-dependent part. Moreover, we conducted speech recognition experiments using conventional HMM-based methods, as well as state-of-the-art deep neural network based method using Kaldi toolkit with promising performance. Text-dependent results have shown that the DeepMine database is more challenging than RSR2015 and RedDots databases.\nAcknowledgments\nThe data collection project was mainly supported by Sharif DeepMine company.

CWS is a basic and essential task for Chinese which is written without explicit word delimiters and different from alphabetical languages like English. BIBREF0 treats Chinese word segmentation (CWS) as a sequence labeling task with character position tags, which is followed by BIBREF1, BIBREF2, BIBREF3. Traditional CWS models depend on the design of features heavily which effects the performance of model. To minimize the effort in feature engineering, some CWS models BIBREF4, BIBREF5, BIBREF6, BIBREF7, BIBREF8, BIBREF9, BIBREF10, BIBREF11 are developed following neural network architecture for sequence labeling tasks BIBREF12. Neural CWS models perform strong ability of feature representation, employing unigram and bigram character embedding as input and approach good performance.\nThe CWS task is often modeled as one graph model based on a scoring model that means it is composed of two parts, one part is an encoder which is used to generate the representation of characters from the input sequence, the other part is a decoder which performs segmentation according to the encoder scoring. Table TABREF1 summarizes typical CWS models according to their decoding ways for both traditional and neural models. Markov models such as BIBREF13 and BIBREF4 depend on the maximum entropy model or maximum entropy Markov model both with a Viterbi decoder. Besides, conditional random field (CRF) or Semi-CRF for sequence labeling has been used for both traditional and neural models though with different representations BIBREF2, BIBREF15, BIBREF10, BIBREF17, BIBREF18. Generally speaking, the major difference between traditional and neural network models is about the way to represent input sentences.\nRecent works about neural CWS which focus on benchmark dataset, namely SIGHAN Bakeoff BIBREF21, may be put into the following three categories roughly.\nEncoder. Practice in various natural language processing tasks has been shown that effective representation is essential to the performance improvement. Thus for better CWS, it is crucial to encode the input character, word or sentence into effective representation. Table TABREF2 summarizes regular feature sets for typical CWS models including ours as well. The building blocks that encoders use include recurrent neural network (RNN) and convolutional neural network (CNN), and long-term memory network (LSTM).\nGraph model. As CWS is a kind of structure learning task, the graph model determines which type of decoder should be adopted for segmentation, also it may limit the capability of defining feature, as shown in Table 2, not all graph models can support the word features. Thus recent work focused on finding more general or flexible graph model to make model learn the representation of segmentation more effective as BIBREF9, BIBREF11.\nExternal data and pre-trained embedding. Whereas both encoder and graph model are about exploring a way to get better performance only by improving the model strength itself. Using external resource such as pre-trained embeddings or language representation is an alternative for the same purpose BIBREF22, BIBREF23. SIGHAN Bakeoff defines two types of evaluation settings, closed test limits all the data for learning should not be beyond the given training set, while open test does not take this limitation BIBREF21. In this work, we will focus on the closed test setting by finding a better model design for further CWS performance improvement.\nShown in Table TABREF1, different decoders have particular decoding algorithms to match the respective CWS models. Markov models and CRF-based models often use Viterbi decoders with polynomial time complexity. In general graph model, search space may be too large for model to search. Thus it forces graph models to use an approximate beam search strategy. Beam search algorithm has a kind low-order polynomial time complexity. Especially, when beam width $b$=1, the beam search algorithm will reduce to greedy algorithm with a better time complexity $O(Mn)$ against the general beam search time complexity $O(Mnb^2)$, where $n$ is the number of units in one sentences, $M$ is a constant representing the model complexity. Greedy decoding algorithm can bring the fastest speed of decoding while it is not easy to guarantee the precision of decoding when the encoder is not strong enough.\nIn this paper, we focus on more effective encoder design which is capable of offering fast and accurate Chinese word segmentation with only unigram feature and greedy decoding. Our proposed encoder will only consist of attention mechanisms as building blocks but nothing else. Motivated by the Transformer BIBREF24 and its strength of capturing long-range dependencies of input sentences, we use a self-attention network to generate the representation of input which makes the model encode sentences at once without feeding input iteratively. Considering the weakness of the Transformer to model relative and absolute position information directly BIBREF25 and the importance of localness information, position information and directional information for CWS, we further improve the architecture of standard multi-head self-attention of the Transformer with a directional Gaussian mask and get a variant called Gaussian-masked directional multi-head attention. Based on the newly improved attention mechanism, we expand the encoder of the Transformer to capture different directional information. With our powerful encoder, our model uses only simple unigram features to generate representation of sentences.\nFor decoder which directly performs the segmentation, we use the bi-affinal attention scorer, which has been used in dependency parsing BIBREF26 and semantic role labeling BIBREF27, to implement greedy decoding on finding the boundaries of words. In our proposed model, greedy decoding ensures a fast segmentation while powerful encoder design ensures a good enough segmentation performance even working with greedy decoder together. Our model will be strictly evaluated on benchmark datasets from SIGHAN Bakeoff shared task on CWS in terms of closed test setting, and the experimental results show that our proposed model achieves new state-of-the-art.\nThe technical contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows.\nWe propose a CWS model with only attention structure. The encoder and decoder are both based on attention structure.\nWith a powerful enough encoder, we for the first time show that unigram (character) featues can help yield strong performance instead of diverse $n$-gram (character and word) features in most of previous work.\nTo capture the representation of localness information and directional information, we propose a variant of directional multi-head self-attention to further enhance the state-of-the-art Transformer encoder.\nModels\nThe CWS task is often modelled as one graph model based on an encoder-based scoring model. The model for CWS task is composed of an encoder to represent the input and a decoder based on the encoder to perform actual segmentation. Figure FIGREF6 is the architecture of our model. The model feeds sentence into encoder. Embedding captures the vector $e=(e_1,...,e_n)$ of the input character sequences of $c=(c_1,...,c_n)$. The encoder maps vector sequences of $ {e}=(e_1,..,e_n)$ to two sequences of vector which are $ {v^b}=(v_1^b,...,v_n^b)$ and ${v^f}=(v_1^f,...v_n^f)$ as the representation of sentences. With $v^b$ and $v^f$, the bi-affinal scorer calculates the probability of each segmentation gaps and predicts the word boundaries of input. Similar as the Transformer, the encoder is an attention network with stacked self-attention and point-wise, fully connected layers while our encoder includes three independent directional encoders.\nModels ::: Encoder Stacks\nIn the Transformer, the encoder is composed of a stack of N identical layers and each layer has one multi-head self-attention layer and one position-wise fully connected feed-forward layer. One residual connection is around two sub-layers and followed by layer normalization BIBREF24. This architecture provides the Transformer a good ability to generate representation of sentence.\nWith the variant of multi-head self-attention, we design a Gaussian-masked directional encoder to capture representation of different directions to improve the ability of capturing the localness information and position information for the importance of adjacent characters. One unidirectional encoder can capture information of one particular direction.\nFor CWS tasks, one gap of characters, which is from a word boundary, can divide one sequence into two parts, one part in front of the gap and one part in the rear of it. The forward encoder and backward encoder are used to capture information of two directions which correspond to two parts divided by the gap.\nOne central encoder is paralleled with forward and backward encoders to capture the information of entire sentences. The central encoder is a special directional encoder for forward and backward information of sentences. The central encoder can fuse the information and enable the encoder to capture the global information.\nThe encoder outputs one forward information and one backward information of each positions. The representation of sentence generated by center encoder will be added to these information directly:\nwhere $v^{b}=(v^b_1,...,v^b_n)$ is the backward information, $v^{f}=(v^f_1,...,v^f_n)$ is the forward information, $r^{b}=(r^b_1,...,r^b_n)$ is the output of backward encoder, $r^{c}=(r^c_1,...,r^c_n)$ is the output of center encoder and $r^{f}=(r^f_1,...,r^f_n)$ is the output of forward encoder.\nModels ::: Gaussian-Masked Directional Multi-Head Attention\nSimilar as scaled dot-product attention BIBREF24, Gaussian-masked directional attention can be described as a function to map queries and key-value pairs to the representation of input. Here queries, keys and values are all vectors. Standard scaled dot-product attention is calculated by dotting query $Q$ with all keys $K$, dividing each values by $\\sqrt{d_k}$, where $\\sqrt{d_k}$ is the dimension of keys, and apply a softmax function to generate the weights in the attention:\nDifferent from scaled dot-product attention, Gaussian-masked directional attention expects to pay attention to the adjacent characters of each positions and cast the localness relationship between characters as a fix Gaussian weight for attention. We assume that the Gaussian weight only relys on the distance between characters.\nFirstly we introduce the Gaussian weight matrix $G$ which presents the localness relationship between each two characters:\nwhere $g_{ij}$ is the Gaussian weight between character $i$ and $j$, $dis_{ij}$ is the distance between character $i$ and $j$, $\\Phi (x)$ is the cumulative distribution function of Gaussian, $\\sigma $ is the standard deviation of Gaussian function and it is a hyperparameter in our method. Equation (DISPLAY_FORM13) can ensure the Gaussian weight equals 1 when $dis_{ij}$ is 0. The larger distance between charactersis, the smaller the weight is, which makes one character can affect its adjacent characters more compared with other characters.\nTo combine the Gaussian weight to the self-attention, we produce the Hadamard product of Gaussian weight matrix $G$ and the score matrix produced by $Q{K^{T}}$\nwhere $AG$ is the Gaussian-masked attention. It ensures that the relationship between two characters with long distances is weaker than adjacent characters.\nThe scaled dot-product attention models the relationship between two characters without regard to their distances in one sequence. For CWS task, the weight between adjacent characters should be more important while it is hard for self-attention to achieve the effect explicitly because the self-attention cannot get the order of sentences directly. The Gaussian-masked attention adjusts the weight between characters and their adjacent character to a larger value which stands for the effect of adjacent characters.\nFor forward and backward encoder, the self-attention sublayer needs to use a triangular matrix mask to let the self-attention focus on different weights:\nwhere $pos_i$ is the position of character $c_i$. The triangular matrix for forward and backward encode are:\n$\\left[ \\begin{matrix} 1 & 0 & 0 & \\cdots &0\\\\ 1 & 1 & 0 & \\cdots &0\\\\ 1 & 1 & 1 & \\cdots &0\\\\ \\vdots &\\vdots &\\vdots &\\ddots &\\vdots \\\\ 1 & 1 & 1 & \\cdots & 1\\\\ \\end{matrix} \\right]$ $\\left[ \\begin{matrix} 1 & 1 & 1 & \\cdots &1 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 1 & \\cdots &1 \\\\ 0 & 0& 1 & \\cdots &1 \\\\ \\vdots &\\vdots &\\vdots &\\ddots &\\vdots \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & \\cdots & 1\\\\ \\end{matrix}\\right]$\nSimilar as BIBREF24, we use multi-head attention to capture information from different dimension positions as Figure FIGREF16 and get Gaussian-masked directional multi-head attention. With multi-head attention architecture, the representation of input can be captured by\nwhere $MH$ is the Gaussian-masked multi-head attention, ${W_i^q, W_i^k,W_i^v} \\in \\mathbb {R}^{d_k \\times d_h}$ is the parameter matrices to generate heads, $d_k$ is the dimension of model and $d_h$ is the dimension of one head.\nModels ::: Bi-affinal Attention Scorer\nRegarding word boundaries as gaps between any adjacent words converts the character labeling task to the gap labeling task. Different from character labeling task, gap labeling task requires information of two adjacent characters. The relationship between adjacent characters can be represented as the type of gap. The characteristic of word boundaries makes bi-affine attention an appropriate scorer for CWS task.\nBi-affinal attention scorer is the component that we use to label the gap. Bi-affinal attention is developed from bilinear attention which has been used in dependency parsing BIBREF26 and SRL BIBREF27. The distribution of labels in a labeling task is often uneven which makes the output layer often include a fixed bias term for the prior probability of different labels BIBREF27. Bi-affine attention uses bias terms to alleviate the burden of the fixed bias term and get the prior probability which makes it different from bilinear attention. The distribution of the gap is uneven that is similar as other labeling task which fits bi-affine.\nBi-affinal attention scorer labels the target depending on information of independent unit and the joint information of two units. In bi-affinal attention, the score $s_{ij}$ of characters $c_i$ and $c_j$ $(i < j)$ is calculated by:\nwhere $v_i^f$ is the forward information of $c_i$ and $v_i^b$ is the backward information of $c_j$. In Equation (DISPLAY_FORM21), $W$, $U$ and $b$ are all parameters that can be updated in training. $W$ is a matrix with shape $(d_i \\times N\\times d_j)$ and $U$ is a $(N\\times (d_i + d_j))$ matrix where $d_i$ is the dimension of vector $v_i^f$ and $N$ is the number of labels.\nIn our model, the biaffine scorer uses the forward information of character in front of the gap and the backward information of the character behind the gap to distinguish the position of characters. Figure FIGREF22 is an example of labeling gap. The method of using biaffine scorer ensures that the boundaries of words can be determined by adjacent characters with different directional information. The score vector of the gap is formed by the probability of being a boundary of word. Further, the model generates all boundaries using activation function in a greedy decoding way.\nExperiments ::: Experimental Settings ::: Data\nWe train and evaluate our model on datasets from SIGHAN Bakeoff 2005 BIBREF21 which has four datasets, PKU, MSR, AS and CITYU. Table TABREF23 shows the statistics of train data. We use F-score to evaluate CWS models. To train model with pre-trained embeddings in AS and CITYU, we use OpenCC to transfer data from traditional Chinese to simplified Chinese.\nExperiments ::: Experimental Settings ::: Pre-trained Embedding\nWe only use unigram feature so we only trained character embeddings. Our pre-trained embedding are pre-trained on Chinese Wikipedia corpus by word2vec BIBREF29 toolkit. The corpus used for pre-trained embedding is all transferred to simplified Chinese and not segmented. On closed test, we use embeddings initialized randomly.\nExperiments ::: Experimental Settings ::: Hyperparameters\nFor different datasets, we use two kinds of hyperparameters which are presented in Table TABREF24. We use hyperparameters in Table TABREF24 for small corpora (PKU and CITYU) and normal corpora (MSR and AS). We set the standard deviation of Gaussian function in Equation (DISPLAY_FORM13) to 2. Each training batch contains sentences with at most 4096 tokens.\nExperiments ::: Experimental Settings ::: Optimizer\nTo train our model, we use the Adam BIBREF30 optimizer with $\\beta _1=0.9$, $\\beta _2=0.98$ and $\\epsilon =10^{-9}$. The learning rate schedule is the same as BIBREF24:\nwhere $d$ is the dimension of embeddings, $step$ is the step number of training and $warmup_step$ is the step number of warmup. When the number of steps is smaller than the step of warmup, the learning rate increases linearly and then decreases.\nExperiments ::: Hardware and Implements\nWe trained our models on a single CPU (Intel i7-5960X) with an nVidia 1080 Ti GPU. We implement our model in Python with Pytorch 1.0.\nExperiments ::: Results\nTables TABREF25 and TABREF26 reports the performance of recent models and ours in terms of closed test setting. Without the assistance of unsupervised segmentation features userd in BIBREF20, our model outperforms all the other models in MSR and AS except BIBREF18 and get comparable performance in PKU and CITYU. Note that all the other models for this comparison adopt various $n$-gram features while only our model takes unigram ones.\nWith unsupervised segmentation features introduced by BIBREF20, our model gets a higher result. Specially, the results in MSR and AS achieve new state-of-the-art and approaching previous state-of-the-art in CITYU and PKU. The unsupervised segmentation features are derived from the given training dataset, thus using them does not violate the rule of closed test of SIGHAN Bakeoff.\nTable TABREF36 compares our model and recent neural models in terms of open test setting in which any external resources, especially pre-trained embeddings or language models can be used. In MSR and AS, our model gets a comparable result while our results in CITYU and PKU are not remarkable.\nHowever, it is well known that it is always hard to compare models when using open test setting, especially with pre-trained embedding. Not all models may use the same method and data to pre-train. Though pre-trained embedding or language model can improve the performance, the performance improvement itself may be from multiple sources. It often that there is a success of pre-trained embedding to improve the performance, while it cannot prove that the model is better.\nCompared with other LSTM models, our model performs better in AS and MSR than in CITYU and PKU. Considering the scale of different corpora, we believe that the size of corpus affects our model and the larger size is, the better model performs. For small corpus, the model tends to be overfitting.\nTables TABREF25 and TABREF26 also show the decoding time in different datasets. Our model finishes the segmentation with the least decoding time in all four datasets, thanks to the architecture of model which only takes attention mechanism as basic block.\nRelated Work ::: Chinese Word Segmentation\nCWS is a task for Chinese natural language process to delimit word boundary. BIBREF0 for the first time formulize CWS as a sequence labeling task. BIBREF3 show that different character tag sets can make essential impact for CWS. BIBREF2 use CRFs as a model for CWS, achieving new state-of-the-art. Works of statistical CWS has built the basis for neural CWS.\nNeural word segmentation has been widely used to minimize the efforts in feature engineering which was important in statistical CWS. BIBREF4 introduce the neural model with sliding-window based sequence labeling. BIBREF6 propose a gated recursive neural network (GRNN) for CWS to incorporate complicated combination of contextual character and n-gram features. BIBREF7 use LSTM to learn long distance information. BIBREF9 propose a neural framework that eliminates context windows and utilize complete segmentation history. BIBREF33 explore a joint model that performs segmentation, POS-Tagging and chunking simultaneously. BIBREF34 propose a feature-enriched neural model for joint CWS and part-of-speech tagging. BIBREF35 present a joint model to enhance the segmentation of Chinese microtext by performing CWS and informal word detection simultaneously. BIBREF17 propose a character-based convolutional neural model to capture $n$-gram features automatically and an effective approach to incorporate word embeddings. BIBREF11 improve the model in BIBREF9 and propose a greedy neural word segmenter with balanced word and character embedding inputs. BIBREF23 propose a novel neural network model to incorporate unlabeled and partially-labeled data. BIBREF36 propose two methods that extend the Bi-LSTM to perform incorporating dictionaries into neural networks for CWS. BIBREF37 propose Switch-LSTMs to segment words and provided a more flexible solution for multi-criteria CWS which is easy to transfer the learned knowledge to new criteria.\nRelated Work ::: Transformer\nTransformer BIBREF24 is an attention-based neural machine translation model. The Transformer is one kind of self-attention networks (SANs) which is proposed in BIBREF38. Encoder of the Transformer consists of one self-attention layer and a position-wise feed-forward layer. Decoder of the Transformer contains one self-attention layer, one encoder-decoder attention layer and one position-wise feed-forward layer. The Transformer uses residual connections around the sublayers and then followed by a layer normalization layer.\nScaled dot-product attention is the key component in the Transformer. The input of attention contains queries, keys, and values of input sequences. The attention is generated using queries and keys like Equation (DISPLAY_FORM11). Structure of scaled dot-product attention allows the self-attention layer generate the representation of sentences at once and contain the information of the sentence which is different from RNN that process characters of sentences one by one. Standard self-attention is similar as Gaussian-masked direction attention while it does not have directional mask and gaussian mask. BIBREF24 also propose multi-head attention which is better to generate representation of sentence by dividing queries, keys and values to different heads and get information from different subspaces.\nConclusion\nIn this paper, we propose an attention mechanism only based Chinese word segmentation model. Our model uses self-attention from the Transformer encoder to take sequence input and bi-affine attention scorer to predict the label of gaps. To improve the ability of capturing the localness and directional information of self-attention based encoder, we propose a variant of self-attention called Gaussian-masked directional multi-head attention to replace the standard self-attention. We also extend the Transformer encoder to capture directional features. Our model uses only unigram features instead of multiple $n$-gram features in previous work. Our model is evaluated on standard benchmark dataset, SIGHAN Bakeoff 2005, which shows not only our model performs segmentation faster than any previous models but also gives new higher or comparable segmentation performance against previous state-of-the-art models.\n\n Answer the question based on the above article as concisely as you can, using a single phrase or sentence if possible.

Markov models such as BIBREF13 and BIBREF4 depend on the maximum entropy model or maximum entropy Markov model both with a Viterbi decoder. Besides, conditional random field (CRF) or Semi-CRF for sequence labeling has been used for both traditional and neural models though with different representations BIBREF2, BIBREF15, BIBREF10, BIBREF17, BIBREF18. Generally speaking, the major difference between traditional and neural network models is about the way to represent input sentences.\nRecent works about neural CWS which focus on benchmark dataset, namely SIGHAN Bakeoff BIBREF21, may be put into the following three categories roughly.\nEncoder. Practice in various natural language processing tasks has been shown that effective representation is essential to the performance improvement. Thus for better CWS, it is crucial to encode the input character, word or sentence into effective representation. Table TABREF2 summarizes regular feature sets for typical CWS models including ours as well. The building blocks that encoders use include recurrent neural network (RNN) and convolutional neural network (CNN), and long-term memory network (LSTM).\nGraph model. As CWS is a kind of structure learning task, the graph model determines which type of decoder should be adopted for segmentation, also it may limit the capability of defining feature, as shown in Table 2, not all graph models can support the word features. Thus recent work focused on finding more general or flexible graph model to make model learn the representation of segmentation more effective as BIBREF9, BIBREF11.\nExternal data and pre-trained embedding. Whereas both encoder and graph model are about exploring a way to get better performance only by improving the model strength itself. Using external resource such as pre-trained embeddings or language representation is an alternative for the same purpose BIBREF22, BIBREF23. SIGHAN Bakeoff defines two types of evaluation settings, closed test limits all the data for learning should not be beyond the given training set, while open test does not take this limitation BIBREF21. In this work, we will focus on the closed test setting by finding a better model design for further CWS performance improvement.\nShown in Table TABREF1, different decoders have particular decoding algorithms to match the respective CWS models. Markov models and CRF-based models often use Viterbi decoders with polynomial time complexity. In general graph model, search space may be too large for model to search. Thus it forces graph models to use an approximate beam search strategy. Beam search algorithm has a kind low-order polynomial time complexity. Especially, when beam width $b$=1, the beam search algorithm will reduce to greedy algorithm with a better time complexity $O(Mn)$ against the general beam search time complexity $O(Mnb^2)$, where $n$ is the number of units in one sentences, $M$ is a constant representing the model complexity. Greedy decoding algorithm can bring the fastest speed of decoding while it is not easy to guarantee the precision of decoding when the encoder is not strong enough.\nIn this paper, we focus on more effective encoder design which is capable of offering fast and accurate Chinese word segmentation with only unigram feature and greedy decoding. Our proposed encoder will only consist of attention mechanisms as building blocks but nothing else. Motivated by the Transformer BIBREF24 and its strength of capturing long-range dependencies of input sentences, we use a self-attention network to generate the representation of input which makes the model encode sentences at once without feeding input iteratively. Considering the weakness of the Transformer to model relative and absolute position information directly BIBREF25 and the importance of localness information, position information and directional information for CWS, we further improve the architecture of standard multi-head self-attention of the Transformer with a directional Gaussian mask and get a variant called Gaussian-masked directional multi-head attention. Based on the newly improved attention mechanism, we expand the encoder of the Transformer to capture different directional information. With our powerful encoder, our model uses only simple unigram features to generate representation of sentences.\nFor decoder which directly performs the segmentation, we use the bi-affinal attention scorer, which has been used in dependency parsing BIBREF26 and semantic role labeling BIBREF27, to implement greedy decoding on finding the boundaries of words. In our proposed model, greedy decoding ensures a fast segmentation while powerful encoder design ensures a good enough segmentation performance even working with greedy decoder together. Our model will be strictly evaluated on benchmark datasets from SIGHAN Bakeoff shared task on CWS in terms of closed test setting, and the experimental results show that our proposed model achieves new state-of-the-art.\nThe technical contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows.\nWe propose a CWS model with only attention structure. The encoder and decoder are both based on attention structure.\nWith a powerful enough encoder, we for the first time show that unigram (character) featues can help yield strong performance instead of diverse $n$-gram (character and word) features in most of previous work.\nTo capture the representation of localness information and directional information, we propose a variant of directional multi-head self-attention to further enhance the state-of-the-art Transformer encoder.\nModels\nThe CWS task is often modelled as one graph model based on an encoder-based scoring model. The model for CWS task is composed of an encoder to represent the input and a decoder based on the encoder to perform actual segmentation. Figure FIGREF6 is the architecture of our model. The model feeds sentence into encoder. Embedding captures the vector $e=(e_1,...,e_n)$ of the input character sequences of $c=(c_1,...,c_n)$. The encoder maps vector sequences of $ {e}=(e_1,..,e_n)$ to two sequences of vector which are $ {v^b}=(v_1^b,...,v_n^b)$ and ${v^f}=(v_1^f,...v_n^f)$ as the representation of sentences. With $v^b$ and $v^f$, the bi-affinal scorer calculates the probability of each segmentation gaps and predicts the word boundaries of input. Similar as the Transformer, the encoder is an attention network with stacked self-attention and point-wise, fully connected layers while our encoder includes three independent directional encoders.\nModels ::: Encoder Stacks\nIn the Transformer, the encoder is composed of a stack of N identical layers and each layer has one multi-head self-attention layer and one position-wise fully connected feed-forward layer. One residual connection is around two sub-layers and followed by layer normalization BIBREF24. This architecture provides the Transformer a good ability to generate representation of sentence.\nWith the variant of multi-head self-attention, we design a Gaussian-masked directional encoder to capture representation of different directions to improve the ability of capturing the localness information and position information for the importance of adjacent characters. One unidirectional encoder can capture information of one particular direction.\nFor CWS tasks, one gap of characters, which is from a word boundary, can divide one sequence into two parts, one part in front of the gap and one part in the rear of it. The forward encoder and backward encoder are used to capture information of two directions which correspond to two parts divided by the gap.\nOne central encoder is paralleled with forward and backward encoders to capture the information of entire sentences. The central encoder is a special directional encoder for forward and backward information of sentences. The central encoder can fuse the information and enable the encoder to capture the global information.\nThe encoder outputs one forward information and one backward information of each positions. The representation of sentence generated by center encoder will be added to these information directly:\nwhere $v^{b}=(v^b_1,...,v^b_n)$ is the backward information, $v^{f}=(v^f_1,...,v^f_n)$ is the forward information, $r^{b}=(r^b_1,...,r^b_n)$ is the output of backward encoder, $r^{c}=(r^c_1,...,r^c_n)$ is the output of center encoder and $r^{f}=(r^f_1,...,r^f_n)$ is the output of forward encoder.\nModels ::: Gaussian-Masked Directional Multi-Head Attention\nSimilar as scaled dot-product attention BIBREF24, Gaussian-masked directional attention can be described as a function to map queries and key-value pairs to the representation of input. Here queries, keys and values are all vectors. Standard scaled dot-product attention is calculated by dotting query $Q$ with all keys $K$, dividing each values by $\\sqrt{d_k}$, where $\\sqrt{d_k}$ is the dimension of keys, and apply a softmax function to generate the weights in the attention:\nDifferent from scaled dot-product attention, Gaussian-masked directional attention expects to pay attention to the adjacent characters of each positions and cast the localness relationship between characters as a fix Gaussian weight for attention. We assume that the Gaussian weight only relys on the distance between characters.\nFirstly we introduce the Gaussian weight matrix $G$ which presents the localness relationship between each two characters:\nwhere $g_{ij}$ is the Gaussian weight between character $i$ and $j$, $dis_{ij}$ is the distance between character $i$ and $j$, $\\Phi (x)$ is the cumulative distribution function of Gaussian, $\\sigma $ is the standard deviation of Gaussian function and it is a hyperparameter in our method. Equation (DISPLAY_FORM13) can ensure the Gaussian weight equals 1 when $dis_{ij}$ is 0. The larger distance between charactersis, the smaller the weight is, which makes one character can affect its adjacent characters more compared with other characters.\nTo combine the Gaussian weight to the self-attention, we produce the Hadamard product of Gaussian weight matrix $G$ and the score matrix produced by $Q{K^{T}}$\nwhere $AG$ is the Gaussian-masked attention. It ensures that the relationship between two characters with long distances is weaker than adjacent characters.\nThe scaled dot-product attention models the relationship between two characters without regard to their distances in one sequence. For CWS task, the weight between adjacent characters should be more important while it is hard for self-attention to achieve the effect explicitly because the self-attention cannot get the order of sentences directly. The Gaussian-masked attention adjusts the weight between characters and their adjacent character to a larger value which stands for the effect of adjacent characters.\nFor forward and backward encoder, the self-attention sublayer needs to use a triangular matrix mask to let the self-attention focus on different weights:\nwhere $pos_i$ is the position of character $c_i$. The triangular matrix for forward and backward encode are:\n$\\left[ \\begin{matrix} 1 & 0 & 0 & \\cdots &0\\\\ 1 & 1 & 0 & \\cdots &0\\\\ 1 & 1 & 1 & \\cdots &0\\\\ \\vdots &\\vdots &\\vdots &\\ddots &\\vdots \\\\ 1 & 1 & 1 & \\cdots & 1\\\\ \\end{matrix} \\right]$ $\\left[ \\begin{matrix} 1 & 1 & 1 & \\cdots &1 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 1 & \\cdots &1 \\\\ 0 & 0& 1 & \\cdots &1 \\\\ \\vdots &\\vdots &\\vdots &\\ddots &\\vdots \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & \\cdots & 1\\\\ \\end{matrix}\\right]$\nSimilar as BIBREF24, we use multi-head attention to capture information from different dimension positions as Figure FIGREF16 and get Gaussian-masked directional multi-head attention. With multi-head attention architecture, the representation of input can be captured by\nwhere $MH$ is the Gaussian-masked multi-head attention, ${W_i^q, W_i^k,W_i^v} \\in \\mathbb {R}^{d_k \\times d_h}$ is the parameter matrices to generate heads, $d_k$ is the dimension of model and $d_h$ is the dimension of one head.\nModels ::: Bi-affinal Attention Scorer\nRegarding word boundaries as gaps between any adjacent words converts the character labeling task to the gap labeling task. Different from character labeling task, gap labeling task requires information of two adjacent characters. The relationship between adjacent characters can be represented as the type of gap. The characteristic of word boundaries makes bi-affine attention an appropriate scorer for CWS task.\nBi-affinal attention scorer is the component that we use to label the gap. Bi-affinal attention is developed from bilinear attention which has been used in dependency parsing BIBREF26 and SRL BIBREF27. The distribution of labels in a labeling task is often uneven which makes the output layer often include a fixed bias term for the prior probability of different labels BIBREF27. Bi-affine attention uses bias terms to alleviate the burden of the fixed bias term and get the prior probability which makes it different from bilinear attention. The distribution of the gap is uneven that is similar as other labeling task which fits bi-affine.\nBi-affinal attention scorer labels the target depending on information of independent unit and the joint information of two units. In bi-affinal attention, the score $s_{ij}$ of characters $c_i$ and $c_j$ $(i < j)$ is calculated by:\nwhere $v_i^f$ is the forward information of $c_i$ and $v_i^b$ is the backward information of $c_j$. In Equation (DISPLAY_FORM21), $W$, $U$ and $b$ are all parameters that can be updated in training. $W$ is a matrix with shape $(d_i \\times N\\times d_j)$ and $U$ is a $(N\\times (d_i + d_j))$ matrix where $d_i$ is the dimension of vector $v_i^f$ and $N$ is the number of labels.\nIn our model, the biaffine scorer uses the forward information of character in front of the gap and the backward information of the character behind the gap to distinguish the position of characters. Figure FIGREF22 is an example of labeling gap. The method of using biaffine scorer ensures that the boundaries of words can be determined by adjacent characters with different directional information. The score vector of the gap is formed by the probability of being a boundary of word. Further, the model generates all boundaries using activation function in a greedy decoding way.\nExperiments ::: Experimental Settings ::: Data\nWe train and evaluate our model on datasets from SIGHAN Bakeoff 2005 BIBREF21 which has four datasets, PKU, MSR, AS and CITYU. Table TABREF23 shows the statistics of train data. We use F-score to evaluate CWS models. To train model with pre-trained embeddings in AS and CITYU, we use OpenCC to transfer data from traditional Chinese to simplified Chinese.\nExperiments ::: Experimental Settings ::: Pre-trained Embedding\nWe only use unigram feature so we only trained character embeddings. Our pre-trained embedding are pre-trained on Chinese Wikipedia corpus by word2vec BIBREF29 toolkit. The corpus used for pre-trained embedding is all transferred to simplified Chinese and not segmented. On closed test, we use embeddings initialized randomly.\nExperiments ::: Experimental Settings ::: Hyperparameters\nFor different datasets, we use two kinds of hyperparameters which are presented in Table TABREF24. We use hyperparameters in Table TABREF24 for small corpora (PKU and CITYU) and normal corpora (MSR and AS). We set the standard deviation of Gaussian function in Equation (DISPLAY_FORM13) to 2. Each training batch contains sentences with at most 4096 tokens.\nExperiments ::: Experimental Settings ::: Optimizer\nTo train our model, we use the Adam BIBREF30 optimizer with $\\beta _1=0.9$, $\\beta _2=0.98$ and $\\epsilon =10^{-9}$. The learning rate schedule is the same as BIBREF24:\nwhere $d$ is the dimension of embeddings, $step$ is the step number of training and $warmup_step$ is the step number of warmup. When the number of steps is smaller than the step of warmup, the learning rate increases linearly and then decreases.\nExperiments ::: Hardware and Implements\nWe trained our models on a single CPU (Intel i7-5960X) with an nVidia 1080 Ti GPU. We implement our model in Python with Pytorch 1.0.\nExperiments ::: Results\nTables TABREF25 and TABREF26 reports the performance of recent models and ours in terms of closed test setting. Without the assistance of unsupervised segmentation features userd in BIBREF20, our model outperforms all the other models in MSR and AS except BIBREF18 and get comparable performance in PKU and CITYU. Note that all the other models for this comparison adopt various $n$-gram features while only our model takes unigram ones.\nWith unsupervised segmentation features introduced by BIBREF20, our model gets a higher result. Specially, the results in MSR and AS achieve new state-of-the-art and approaching previous state-of-the-art in CITYU and PKU. The unsupervised segmentation features are derived from the given training dataset, thus using them does not violate the rule of closed test of SIGHAN Bakeoff.\nTable TABREF36 compares our model and recent neural models in terms of open test setting in which any external resources, especially pre-trained embeddings or language models can be used. In MSR and AS, our model gets a comparable result while our results in CITYU and PKU are not remarkable.\nHowever, it is well known that it is always hard to compare models when using open test setting, especially with pre-trained embedding. Not all models may use the same method and data to pre-train. Though pre-trained embedding or language model can improve the performance, the performance improvement itself may be from multiple sources. It often that there is a success of pre-trained embedding to improve the performance, while it cannot prove that the model is better.\nCompared with other LSTM models, our model performs better in AS and MSR than in CITYU and PKU. Considering the scale of different corpora, we believe that the size of corpus affects our model and the larger size is, the better model performs. For small corpus, the model tends to be overfitting.\nTables TABREF25 and TABREF26 also show the decoding time in different datasets. Our model finishes the segmentation with the least decoding time in all four datasets, thanks to the architecture of model which only takes attention mechanism as basic block.\nRelated Work ::: Chinese Word Segmentation\nCWS is a task for Chinese natural language process to delimit word boundary. BIBREF0 for the first time formulize CWS as a sequence labeling task. BIBREF3 show that different character tag sets can make essential impact for CWS. BIBREF2 use CRFs as a model for CWS, achieving new state-of-the-art. Works of statistical CWS has built the basis for neural CWS.\nNeural word segmentation has been widely used to minimize the efforts in feature engineering which was important in statistical CWS. BIBREF4 introduce the neural model with sliding-window based sequence labeling. BIBREF6 propose a gated recursive neural network (GRNN) for CWS to incorporate complicated combination of contextual character and n-gram features. BIBREF7 use LSTM to learn long distance information. BIBREF9 propose a neural framework that eliminates context windows and utilize complete segmentation history. BIBREF33 explore a joint model that performs segmentation, POS-Tagging and chunking simultaneously. BIBREF34 propose a feature-enriched neural model for joint CWS and part-of-speech tagging. BIBREF35 present a joint model to enhance the segmentation of Chinese microtext by performing CWS and informal word detection simultaneously. BIBREF17 propose a character-based convolutional neural model to capture $n$-gram features automatically and an effective approach to incorporate word embeddings. BIBREF11 improve the model in BIBREF9 and propose a greedy neural word segmenter with balanced word and character embedding inputs. BIBREF23 propose a novel neural network model to incorporate unlabeled and partially-labeled data. BIBREF36 propose two methods that extend the Bi-LSTM to perform incorporating dictionaries into neural networks for CWS. BIBREF37 propose Switch-LSTMs to segment words and provided a more flexible solution for multi-criteria CWS which is easy to transfer the learned knowledge to new criteria.\nRelated Work ::: Transformer\nTransformer BIBREF24 is an attention-based neural machine translation model. The Transformer is one kind of self-attention networks (SANs) which is proposed in BIBREF38. Encoder of the Transformer consists of one self-attention layer and a position-wise feed-forward layer. Decoder of the Transformer contains one self-attention layer, one encoder-decoder attention layer and one position-wise feed-forward layer. The Transformer uses residual connections around the sublayers and then followed by a layer normalization layer.\nScaled dot-product attention is the key component in the Transformer. The input of attention contains queries, keys, and values of input sequences. The attention is generated using queries and keys like Equation (DISPLAY_FORM11). Structure of scaled dot-product attention allows the self-attention layer generate the representation of sentences at once and contain the information of the sentence which is different from RNN that process characters of sentences one by one. Standard self-attention is similar as Gaussian-masked direction attention while it does not have directional mask and gaussian mask. BIBREF24 also propose multi-head attention which is better to generate representation of sentence by dividing queries, keys and values to different heads and get information from different subspaces.\nConclusion\nIn this paper, we propose an attention mechanism only based Chinese word segmentation model. Our model uses self-attention from the Transformer encoder to take sequence input and bi-affine attention scorer to predict the label of gaps. To improve the ability of capturing the localness and directional information of self-attention based encoder, we propose a variant of self-attention called Gaussian-masked directional multi-head attention to replace the standard self-attention. We also extend the Transformer encoder to capture directional features. Our model uses only unigram features instead of multiple $n$-gram features in previous work. Our model is evaluated on standard benchmark dataset, SIGHAN Bakeoff 2005, which shows not only our model performs segmentation faster than any previous models but also gives new higher or comparable segmentation performance against previous state-of-the-art models.", "answers": ["pays attentions to adjacent characters and casts a localness relationship between the characters as a fixed Gaussian weight assuming the weight relies on the distance between characters", "Gaussian-masked directional attention can be described as a function to map queries and key-value pairs to the representation of input, Gaussian-masked directional attention expects to pay attention to the adjacent characters of each positions and cast the localness relationship between characters as a fix Gaussian weight for attention, Gaussian weight only relys on the distance between characters"], "length": 3612, "dataset": "qasper_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "4528fad5e57b98d3022a13b580bd4daa018c7129c12d50ea", "pred": " It uses Gaussian weights to model the localness and directional information of characters in a sequence."}

Additionally, multilingual pre-trained models enable many NLP applications for other languages via zero-short cross-lingual transfer. Zero-shot cross-lingual transfer has shown promising results for rapidly building applications for low resource languages. BIBREF2 show the potential of multilingual-BERT BIBREF0 in zero-shot transfer for a large number of languages from different language families on five NLP tasks, namely, natural language inference, document classification, named entity recognition, part-of-speech tagging, and dependency parsing.\nAlthough multilingual models are an important ingredient for enhancing language technology in many languages, recent research on improving pre-trained models puts much emphasis on English BIBREF3, BIBREF4, BIBREF5. The current state of affairs makes it difficult to translate advancements in pre-training from English to non-English languages. To our best knowledge, there are only three available multilingual pre-trained models to date: (1) the multilingual-BERT (mBERT) that supports 104 languages, (2) cross-lingual language model BIBREF6 that supports 100 languages, and (3) Language Agnostic SEntence Representations BIBREF7 that supports 93 languages. Among the three models, LASER is based on neural machine translation approach and strictly requires parallel data to train.\nDo multilingual models always need to be trained from scratch? Can we transfer linguistic knowledge learned by English pre-trained models to other languages? In this work, we develop a technique to rapidly transfer an existing pre-trained model from English to other languages in an energy efficient way BIBREF8. As the first step, we focus on building a bilingual language model (LM) of English and a target language. Starting from a pre-trained English LM, we learn the target language specific parameters (i.e., word embeddings), while keeping the encoder layers of the pre-trained English LM fixed. We then fine-tune both English and target model to obtain the bilingual LM. We apply our approach to autoencoding language models with masked language model objective and show the advantage of the proposed approach in zero-shot transfer. Our main contributions in this work are:\nWe propose a fast adaptation method for obtaining a bilingual BERT$_{\\textsc {base}}$ of English and a target language within a day using one Tesla V100 16GB GPU.\nWe evaluate our bilingual LMs for six languages on two zero-shot cross-lingual transfer tasks, namely natural language inference BIBREF9 and universal dependency parsing. We show that our models offer competitive performance or even better that mBERT.\nWe illustrate that our bilingual LMs can serve as an excellent feature extractor in supervised dependency parsing task.\nBilingual Pre-trained LMs\nWe first provide some background of pre-trained language models. Let $_e$ be English word-embeddings and $\\Psi ()$ be the Transformer BIBREF10 encoder with parameters $$. Let $_{w_i}$ denote the embedding of word $w_i$ (i.e., $_{w_i} = _e[w_1]$). We omit positional embeddings and bias for clarity. A pre-trained LM typically performs the following computations: (i) transform a sequence of input tokens to contextualized representations $[_{w_1},\\dots ,_{w_n}] = \\Psi (_{w_1}, \\dots , _{w_n}; )$, and (ii) predict an output word $y_i$ at $i^{\\text{th}}$ position $p(y_i | _{w_i}) \\propto \\exp (_{w_i}^\\top _{y_i})$.\nAutoencoding LM BIBREF0 corrupts some input tokens $w_i$ by replacing them with a special token [MASK]. It then predicts the original tokens $y_i = w_i$ from the corrupted tokens. Autoregressive LM BIBREF3 predicts the next token ($y_i = w_{i+1}$) given all the previous tokens. The recently proposed XLNet model BIBREF5 is an autoregressive LM that factorizes output with all possible permutations, which shows empirical performance improvement over GPT-2 due to the ability to capture bidirectional context. Here we assume that the encoder performs necessary masking with respect to each training objective.\nGiven an English pre-trained LM, we wish to learn a bilingual LM for English and a given target language $f$ under a limited computational resource budget. To quickly build a bilingual LM, we directly adapt the English pre-traind model to the target model. Our approach consists of three steps. First, we initialize target language word-embeddings $_f$ in the English embedding space such that embeddings of a target word and its English equivalents are close together (\u00a7SECREF8). Next, we create a target LM from the target embeddings and the English encoder $\\Psi ()$. We then fine-tune target embeddings while keeping $\\Psi ()$ fixed (\u00a7SECREF14). Finally, we construct a bilingual LM of $_e$, $_f$, and $\\Psi ()$ and fine-tune all the parameters (\u00a7SECREF15). Figure FIGREF7 illustrates the last two steps in our approach.\nBilingual Pre-trained LMs ::: Initializing Target Embeddings\nOur approach to learn the initial foreign word embeddings $_f \\in ^{|V_f| \\times d}$ is based on the idea of mapping the trained English word embeddings $_e \\in ^{|V_e| \\times d}$ to $_f$ such that if a foreign word and an English word are similar in meaning then their embeddings are similar. Borrowing the idea of universal lexical sharing from BIBREF11, we represent each foreign word embedding $_f[i] \\in ^d$ as a linear combination of English word embeddings $_e[j] \\in ^d$\nwhere $_i\\in ^{|V_e|}$ is a sparse vector and $\\sum _j^{|V_e|} \\alpha _{ij} = 1$.\nIn this step of initializing foreign embeddings, having a good estimation of $$ could speed of the convergence when tuning the foreign model and enable zero-shot transfer (\u00a7SECREF5). In the following, we discuss how to estimate $_i\\;\\forall i\\in \\lbrace 1,2, \\dots , |V_f|\\rbrace $ under two scenarios: (i) we have parallel data of English-foreign, and (ii) we only rely on English and foreign monolingual data.\nBilingual Pre-trained LMs ::: Initializing Target Embeddings ::: Learning from Parallel Corpus\nGiven an English-foreign parallel corpus, we can estimate word translation probability $p(e\\,|\\,f)$ for any (English-foreign) pair $(e, f)$ using popular word-alignment BIBREF12 toolkits such as fast-align BIBREF13. We then assign:\nSince $_i$ is estimated from word alignment, it is a sparse vector.\nBilingual Pre-trained LMs ::: Initializing Target Embeddings ::: Learning from Monolingual Corpus\nFor low resource languages, parallel data may not be available. In this case, we rely only on monolingual data (e.g., Wikipedias). We estimate word translation probabilities from word embeddings of the two languages. Word vectors of these languages can be learned using fastText BIBREF14 and then are aligned into a shared space with English BIBREF15, BIBREF16. Unlike learning contextualized representations, learning word vectors is fast and computationally cheap. Given the aligned vectors $\\bar{}_f$ of foreign and $\\bar{}_e$ of English, we calculate the word translation matrix $\\in ^{|V_f|\\times |V_e|}$ as\nHere, we use $\\mathrm {sparsemax}$ BIBREF17 instead of softmax. Sparsemax is a sparse version of softmax and it puts zero probabilities on most of the word in the English vocabulary except few English words that are similar to a given foreign word. This property is desirable in our approach since it leads to a better initialization of the foreign embeddings.\nBilingual Pre-trained LMs ::: Fine-tuning Target Embeddings\nAfter initializing foreign word-embeddings, we replace English word-embeddings in the English pre-trained LM with foreign word-embeddings to obtain the foreign LM. We then fine-tune only foreign word-embeddings on monolingual data. The training objective is the same as the training objective of the English pre-trained LM (i.e., masked LM for BERT). Since the trained encoder $\\Psi ()$ is good at capturing association, the purpose of this step is to further optimize target embeddings such that the target LM can utilized the trained encoder for association task. For example, if the words Albert Camus presented in a French input sequence, the self-attention in the encoder more likely attends to words absurde and existentialisme once their embeddings are tuned.\nBilingual Pre-trained LMs ::: Fine-tuning Bilingual LM\nWe create a bilingual LM by plugging foreign language specific parameters to the pre-trained English LM (Figure FIGREF7). The new model has two separate embedding layers and output layers, one for English and one for foreign language. The encoder layer in between is shared. We then fine-tune this model using English and foreign monolingual data. Here, we keep tuning the model on English to ensure that it does not forget what it has learned in English and that we can use the resulting model for zero-shot transfer (\u00a7SECREF3). In this step, the encoder parameters are also updated so that in can learn syntactic aspects (i.e., word order, morphological agreement) of the target languages.\nZero-shot Experiments\nWe build our bilingual LMs, named RAMEN, starting from BERT$_{\\textsc {base}}$, BERT$_{\\textsc {large}}$, RoBERTa$_{\\textsc {base}}$, and RoBERTa$_{\\textsc {large}}$ pre-trained models. Using BERT$_{\\textsc {base}}$ allows us to compare the results with mBERT model. Using BERT$_{\\textsc {large}}$ and RoBERTa allows us to investigate whether the performance of the target LM correlates with the performance of the source LM. We evaluate our models on two cross-lingual zero-shot tasks: (1) Cross-lingual Natural Language Inference (XNLI) and (2) dependency parsing.\nZero-shot Experiments ::: Data\nWe evaluate our approach for six target languages: French (fr), Russian (ru), Arabic (ar), Chinese (zh), Hindi (hi), and Vietnamese (vi). These languages belong to four different language families. French, Russian, and Hindi are Indo-European languages, similar to English. Arabic, Chinese, and Vietnamese belong to Afro-Asiatic, Sino-Tibetan, and Austro-Asiatic family respectively. The choice of the six languages also reflects different training conditions depending on the amount of monolingual data. French and Russian, and Arabic can be regarded as high resource languages whereas Hindi has far less data and can be considered as low resource.\nFor experiments that use parallel data to initialize foreign specific parameters, we use the same datasets in the work of BIBREF6. Specifically, we use United Nations Parallel Corpus BIBREF18 for en-ru, en-ar, en-zh, and en-fr. We collect en-hi parallel data from IIT Bombay corpus BIBREF19 and en-vi data from OpenSubtitles 2018. For experiments that use only monolingual data to initialize foreign parameters, instead of training word-vectors from the scratch, we use the pre-trained word vectors from fastText BIBREF14 to estimate word translation probabilities (Eq. DISPLAY_FORM13). We align these vectors into a common space using orthogonal Procrustes BIBREF20, BIBREF15, BIBREF16. We only use identical words between the two languages as the supervised signal. We use WikiExtractor to extract extract raw sentences from Wikipedias as monolingual data for fine-tuning target embeddings and bilingual LMs (\u00a7SECREF15). We do not lowercase or remove accents in our data preprocessing pipeline.\nWe tokenize English using the provided tokenizer from pre-trained models. For target languages, we use fastBPE to learn 30,000 BPE codes and 50,000 codes when transferring from BERT and RoBERTa respectively. We truncate the BPE vocabulary of foreign languages to match the size of the English vocabulary in the source models. Precisely, the size of foreign vocabulary is set to 32,000 when transferring from BERT and 50,000 when transferring from RoBERTa.\nWe use XNLI dataset BIBREF9 for classification task and Universal Dependencies v2.4 BIBREF21 for parsing task. Since a language might have more than one treebank in Universal Dependencies, we use the following treebanks: en_ewt (English), fr_gsd (French), ru_syntagrus (Russian) ar_padt (Arabic), vi_vtb (Vietnamese), hi_hdtb (Hindi), and zh_gsd (Chinese).\nZero-shot Experiments ::: Data ::: Remark on BPE\nBIBREF22 show that sharing subwords between languages improves alignments between embedding spaces. BIBREF2 observe a strong correlation between the percentage of overlapping subwords and mBERT's performances for cross-lingual zero-shot transfer. However, in our current approach, subwords between source and target are not shared. A subword that is in both English and foreign vocabulary has two different embeddings.\nZero-shot Experiments ::: Estimating translation probabilities\nSince pre-trained models operate on subword level, we need to estimate subword translation probabilities. Therefore, we subsample 2M sentence pairs from each parallel corpus and tokenize the data into subwords before running fast-align BIBREF13.\nEstimating subword translation probabilities from aligned word vectors requires an additional processing step since the provided vectors from fastText are not at subword level. We use the following approximation to obtain subword vectors: the vector $_s$ of subword $s$ is the weighted average of all the aligned word vectors $_{w_i}$ that have $s$ as an subword\nwhere $p(w_j)$ is the unigram probability of word $w_j$ and $n_s = \\sum _{w_j:\\, s\\in w_j} p(w_j)$. We take the top 50,000 words in each aligned word-vectors to compute subword vectors.\nIn both cases, not all the words in the foreign vocabulary can be initialized from the English word-embeddings. Those words are initialized randomly from a Gaussian $\\mathcal {N}(0, {1}{d^2})$.\nZero-shot Experiments ::: Hyper-parameters\nIn all the experiments, we tune RAMEN$_{\\textsc {base}}$ for 175,000 updates and RAMEN$_{\\textsc {large}}$ for 275,000 updates where the first 25,000 updates are for language specific parameters. The sequence length is set to 256. The mini-batch size are 64 and 24 when tuning language specific parameters using RAMEN$_{\\textsc {base}}$ and RAMEN$_{\\textsc {large}}$ respectively. For tuning bilingual LMs, we use a mini-batch size of 64 for RAMEN$_{\\textsc {base}}$ and 24 for RAMEN$_{\\textsc {large}}$ where half of the batch are English sequences and the other half are foreign sequences. This strategy of balancing mini-batch has been used in multilingual neural machine translation BIBREF23, BIBREF24.\nWe optimize RAMEN$_{\\textsc {base}}$ using Lookahead optimizer BIBREF25 wrapped around Adam with the learning rate of $10^{-4}$, the number of fast weight updates $k=5$, and interpolation parameter $\\alpha =0.5$. We choose Lookahead optimizer because it has been shown to be robust to the initial parameters of the based optimizer (Adam). For Adam optimizer, we linearly increase the learning rate from $10^{-7}$ to $10^{-4}$ in the first 4000 updates and then follow an inverse square root decay. All RAMEN$_{\\textsc {large}}$ models are optimized with Adam due to memory limit.\nWhen fine-tuning RAMEN on XNLI and UD, we use a mini-batch size of 32, Adam's learning rate of $10^{-5}$. The number of epochs are set to 4 and 50 for XNLI and UD tasks respectively. All experiments are carried out on a single Tesla V100 16GB GPU. Each RAMEN$_{\\textsc {base}}$ model is trained within a day and each RAMEN$_{\\textsc {large}}$ is trained within two days.\nResults\nIn this section, we present the results of out models for two zero-shot cross lingual transfer tasks: XNLI and dependency parsing.\nResults ::: Cross-lingual Natural Language Inference\nTable TABREF32 shows the XNLI test accuracy. For reference, we also include the scores from the previous work, notably the state-of-the-art system XLM BIBREF6. Before discussing the results, we spell out that the fairest comparison in this experiment is the comparison between mBERT and RAMEN$_{\\textsc {base}}$+BERT trained with monolingual only.\nWe first discuss the transfer results from BERT. Initialized from fastText vectors, RAMEN$_{\\textsc {base}}$ slightly outperforms mBERT by 1.9 points on average and widen the gap of 3.3 points on Arabic. RAMEN$_{\\textsc {base}}$ gains extra 0.8 points on average when initialized from parallel data. With triple number of parameters, RAMEN$_{\\textsc {large}}$ offers an additional boost in term of accuracy and initialization with parallel data consistently improves the performance. It has been shown that BERT$_{\\textsc {large}}$ significantly outperforms BERT$_{\\textsc {base}}$ on 11 English NLP tasks BIBREF0, the strength of BERT$_{\\textsc {large}}$ also shows up when adapted to foreign languages.\nTransferring from RoBERTa leads to better zero-shot accuracies. With the same initializing condition, RAMEN$_{\\textsc {base}}$+RoBERTa outperforms RAMEN$_{\\textsc {base}}$+BERT on average by 2.9 and 2.3 points when initializing from monolingual and parallel data respectively. This result show that with similar number of parameters, our approach benefits from a better English pre-trained model. When transferring from RoBERTa$_{\\textsc {large}}$, we obtain state-of-the-art results for five languages.\nCurrently, RAMEN only uses parallel data to initialize foreign embeddings. RAMEN can also exploit parallel data through translation objective proposed in XLM. We believe that by utilizing parallel data during the fine-tuning of RAMEN would bring additional benefits for zero-shot tasks. We leave this exploration to future work. In summary, starting from BERT$_{\\textsc {base}}$, our approach obtains competitive bilingual LMs with mBERT for zero-shot XNLI. Our approach shows the accuracy gains when adapting from a better pre-trained model.\nResults ::: Universal Dependency Parsing\nWe build on top of RAMEN a graph-based dependency parser BIBREF27. For the purpose of evaluating the contextual representations learned by our model, we do not use part-of-speech tags. Contextualized representations are directly fed into Deep-Biaffine layers to predict arc and label scores. Table TABREF34 presents the Labeled Attachment Scores (LAS) for zero-shot dependency parsing.\nWe first look at the fairest comparison between mBERT and monolingually initialized RAMEN$_{\\textsc {base}}$+BERT. The latter outperforms the former on five languages except Arabic. We observe the largest gain of +5.2 LAS for French. Chinese enjoys +3.1 LAS from our approach. With similar architecture (12 or 24 layers) and initialization (using monolingual or parallel data), RAMEN+RoBERTa performs better than RAMEN+BERT for most of the languages. Arabic and Hindi benefit the most from bigger models. For the other four languages, RAMEN$_{\\textsc {large}}$ renders a modest improvement over RAMEN$_{\\textsc {base}}$.\nAnalysis ::: Impact of initialization\nInitializing foreign embeddings is the backbone of our approach. A good initialization leads to better zero-shot transfer results and enables fast adaptation. To verify the importance of a good initialization, we train a RAMEN$_{\\textsc {base}}$+RoBERTa with foreign word-embeddings are initialized randomly from $\\mathcal {N}(0, {1}{d^2})$. For a fair comparison, we use the same hyper-parameters in \u00a7SECREF27. Table TABREF36 shows the results of XNLI and UD parsing of random initialization. In comparison to the initialization using aligned fastText vectors, random initialization decreases the zero-shot performance of RAMEN$_{\\textsc {base}}$ by 15.9% for XNLI and 27.8 points for UD parsing on average. We also see that zero-shot parsing of SOV languages (Arabic and Hindi) suffers random initialization.\nAnalysis ::: Are contextual representations from RAMEN also good for supervised parsing?\nAll the RAMEN models are built from English and tuned on English for zero-shot cross-lingual tasks. It is reasonable to expect RAMENs do well in those tasks as we have shown in our experiments. But are they also a good feature extractor for supervised tasks? We offer a partial answer to this question by evaluating our model for supervised dependency parsing on UD datasets.\nWe used train/dev/test splits provided in UD to train and evaluate our RAMEN-based parser. Table TABREF38 summarizes the results (LAS) of our supervised parser. For a fair comparison, we choose mBERT as the baseline and all the RAMEN models are initialized from aligned fastText vectors. With the same architecture of 12 Transformer layers, RAMEN$_{\\textsc {base}}$+BERT performs competitive to mBERT and outshines mBERT by +1.2 points for Vietnamese. The best LAS results are obtained by RAMEN$_{\\textsc {large}}$+RoBERTa with 24 Transformer layers. Overall, our results indicate the potential of using contextual representations from RAMEN for supervised tasks.\nAnalysis ::: How does linguistic knowledge transfer happen through each training stages?\nWe evaluate the performance of RAMEN+RoBERTa$_{\\textsc {base}}$ (initialized from monolingual data) at each training steps: initialization of word embeddings (0K update), fine-tuning target embeddings (25K), and fine-tuning the model on both English and target language (at each 25K updates). The results are presented in Figure FIGREF40.\nWithout fine-tuning, the average accuracy of XLNI is 39.7% for a three-ways classification task, and the average LAS score is 3.6 for dependency parsing. We see the biggest leap in the performance after 50K updates. While semantic similarity task profits significantly at 25K updates of the target embeddings, syntactic task benefits with further fine-tuning the encoder. This is expected since the target languages might exhibit different syntactic structures than English and fine-tuning encoder helps to capture language specific structures. We observe a substantial gain of 19-30 LAS for all languages except French after 50K updates.\nLanguage similarities have more impact on transferring syntax than semantics. Without tuning the English encoder, French enjoys 50.3 LAS for being closely related to English, whereas Arabic and Hindi, SOV languages, modestly reach 4.2 and 6.4 points using the SVO encoder. Although Chinese has SVO order, it is often seen as head-final while English is strong head-initial. Perhaps, this explains the poor performance for Chinese.\nLimitations\nWhile we have successfully adapted autoencoding pre-trained LMs from English to other languages, the question whether our approach can also be applied for autoregressive LM such as XLNet still remains. We leave the investigation to future work.\nConclusions\nIn this work, we have presented a simple and effective approach for rapidly building a bilingual LM under a limited computational budget. Using BERT as the starting point, we demonstrate that our approach produces better than mBERT on two cross-lingual zero-shot sentence classification and dependency parsing. We find that the performance of our bilingual LM, RAMEN, correlates with the performance of the original pre-trained English models. We also find that RAMEN is also a powerful feature extractor in supervised dependency parsing. Finally, we hope that our work sparks of interest in developing fast and effective methods for transferring pre-trained English models to other languages.\n\n Answer the question based on the above article as concisely as you can, using a single phrase or sentence if possible.

Additionally, multilingual pre-trained models enable many NLP applications for other languages via zero-short cross-lingual transfer. Zero-shot cross-lingual transfer has shown promising results for rapidly building applications for low resource languages. BIBREF2 show the potential of multilingual-BERT BIBREF0 in zero-shot transfer for a large number of languages from different language families on five NLP tasks, namely, natural language inference, document classification, named entity recognition, part-of-speech tagging, and dependency parsing.\nAlthough multilingual models are an important ingredient for enhancing language technology in many languages, recent research on improving pre-trained models puts much emphasis on English BIBREF3, BIBREF4, BIBREF5. The current state of affairs makes it difficult to translate advancements in pre-training from English to non-English languages. To our best knowledge, there are only three available multilingual pre-trained models to date: (1) the multilingual-BERT (mBERT) that supports 104 languages, (2) cross-lingual language model BIBREF6 that supports 100 languages, and (3) Language Agnostic SEntence Representations BIBREF7 that supports 93 languages. Among the three models, LASER is based on neural machine translation approach and strictly requires parallel data to train.\nDo multilingual models always need to be trained from scratch? Can we transfer linguistic knowledge learned by English pre-trained models to other languages? In this work, we develop a technique to rapidly transfer an existing pre-trained model from English to other languages in an energy efficient way BIBREF8. As the first step, we focus on building a bilingual language model (LM) of English and a target language. Starting from a pre-trained English LM, we learn the target language specific parameters (i.e., word embeddings), while keeping the encoder layers of the pre-trained English LM fixed. We then fine-tune both English and target model to obtain the bilingual LM. We apply our approach to autoencoding language models with masked language model objective and show the advantage of the proposed approach in zero-shot transfer. Our main contributions in this work are:\nWe propose a fast adaptation method for obtaining a bilingual BERT$_{\\textsc {base}}$ of English and a target language within a day using one Tesla V100 16GB GPU.\nWe evaluate our bilingual LMs for six languages on two zero-shot cross-lingual transfer tasks, namely natural language inference BIBREF9 and universal dependency parsing. We show that our models offer competitive performance or even better that mBERT.\nWe illustrate that our bilingual LMs can serve as an excellent feature extractor in supervised dependency parsing task.\nBilingual Pre-trained LMs\nWe first provide some background of pre-trained language models. Let $_e$ be English word-embeddings and $\\Psi ()$ be the Transformer BIBREF10 encoder with parameters $$. Let $_{w_i}$ denote the embedding of word $w_i$ (i.e., $_{w_i} = _e[w_1]$). We omit positional embeddings and bias for clarity. A pre-trained LM typically performs the following computations: (i) transform a sequence of input tokens to contextualized representations $[_{w_1},\\dots ,_{w_n}] = \\Psi (_{w_1}, \\dots , _{w_n}; )$, and (ii) predict an output word $y_i$ at $i^{\\text{th}}$ position $p(y_i | _{w_i}) \\propto \\exp (_{w_i}^\\top _{y_i})$.\nAutoencoding LM BIBREF0 corrupts some input tokens $w_i$ by replacing them with a special token [MASK]. It then predicts the original tokens $y_i = w_i$ from the corrupted tokens. Autoregressive LM BIBREF3 predicts the next token ($y_i = w_{i+1}$) given all the previous tokens. The recently proposed XLNet model BIBREF5 is an autoregressive LM that factorizes output with all possible permutations, which shows empirical performance improvement over GPT-2 due to the ability to capture bidirectional context. Here we assume that the encoder performs necessary masking with respect to each training objective.\nGiven an English pre-trained LM, we wish to learn a bilingual LM for English and a given target language $f$ under a limited computational resource budget. To quickly build a bilingual LM, we directly adapt the English pre-traind model to the target model. Our approach consists of three steps. First, we initialize target language word-embeddings $_f$ in the English embedding space such that embeddings of a target word and its English equivalents are close together (\u00a7SECREF8). Next, we create a target LM from the target embeddings and the English encoder $\\Psi ()$. We then fine-tune target embeddings while keeping $\\Psi ()$ fixed (\u00a7SECREF14). Finally, we construct a bilingual LM of $_e$, $_f$, and $\\Psi ()$ and fine-tune all the parameters (\u00a7SECREF15). Figure FIGREF7 illustrates the last two steps in our approach.\nBilingual Pre-trained LMs ::: Initializing Target Embeddings\nOur approach to learn the initial foreign word embeddings $_f \\in ^{|V_f| \\times d}$ is based on the idea of mapping the trained English word embeddings $_e \\in ^{|V_e| \\times d}$ to $_f$ such that if a foreign word and an English word are similar in meaning then their embeddings are similar. Borrowing the idea of universal lexical sharing from BIBREF11, we represent each foreign word embedding $_f[i] \\in ^d$ as a linear combination of English word embeddings $_e[j] \\in ^d$\nwhere $_i\\in ^{|V_e|}$ is a sparse vector and $\\sum _j^{|V_e|} \\alpha _{ij} = 1$.\nIn this step of initializing foreign embeddings, having a good estimation of $$ could speed of the convergence when tuning the foreign model and enable zero-shot transfer (\u00a7SECREF5). In the following, we discuss how to estimate $_i\\;\\forall i\\in \\lbrace 1,2, \\dots , |V_f|\\rbrace $ under two scenarios: (i) we have parallel data of English-foreign, and (ii) we only rely on English and foreign monolingual data.\nBilingual Pre-trained LMs ::: Initializing Target Embeddings ::: Learning from Parallel Corpus\nGiven an English-foreign parallel corpus, we can estimate word translation probability $p(e\\,|\\,f)$ for any (English-foreign) pair $(e, f)$ using popular word-alignment BIBREF12 toolkits such as fast-align BIBREF13. We then assign:\nSince $_i$ is estimated from word alignment, it is a sparse vector.\nBilingual Pre-trained LMs ::: Initializing Target Embeddings ::: Learning from Monolingual Corpus\nFor low resource languages, parallel data may not be available. In this case, we rely only on monolingual data (e.g., Wikipedias). We estimate word translation probabilities from word embeddings of the two languages. Word vectors of these languages can be learned using fastText BIBREF14 and then are aligned into a shared space with English BIBREF15, BIBREF16. Unlike learning contextualized representations, learning word vectors is fast and computationally cheap. Given the aligned vectors $\\bar{}_f$ of foreign and $\\bar{}_e$ of English, we calculate the word translation matrix $\\in ^{|V_f|\\times |V_e|}$ as\nHere, we use $\\mathrm {sparsemax}$ BIBREF17 instead of softmax. Sparsemax is a sparse version of softmax and it puts zero probabilities on most of the word in the English vocabulary except few English words that are similar to a given foreign word. This property is desirable in our approach since it leads to a better initialization of the foreign embeddings.\nBilingual Pre-trained LMs ::: Fine-tuning Target Embeddings\nAfter initializing foreign word-embeddings, we replace English word-embeddings in the English pre-trained LM with foreign word-embeddings to obtain the foreign LM. We then fine-tune only foreign word-embeddings on monolingual data. The training objective is the same as the training objective of the English pre-trained LM (i.e., masked LM for BERT). Since the trained encoder $\\Psi ()$ is good at capturing association, the purpose of this step is to further optimize target embeddings such that the target LM can utilized the trained encoder for association task. For example, if the words Albert Camus presented in a French input sequence, the self-attention in the encoder more likely attends to words absurde and existentialisme once their embeddings are tuned.\nBilingual Pre-trained LMs ::: Fine-tuning Bilingual LM\nWe create a bilingual LM by plugging foreign language specific parameters to the pre-trained English LM (Figure FIGREF7). The new model has two separate embedding layers and output layers, one for English and one for foreign language. The encoder layer in between is shared. We then fine-tune this model using English and foreign monolingual data. Here, we keep tuning the model on English to ensure that it does not forget what it has learned in English and that we can use the resulting model for zero-shot transfer (\u00a7SECREF3). In this step, the encoder parameters are also updated so that in can learn syntactic aspects (i.e., word order, morphological agreement) of the target languages.\nZero-shot Experiments\nWe build our bilingual LMs, named RAMEN, starting from BERT$_{\\textsc {base}}$, BERT$_{\\textsc {large}}$, RoBERTa$_{\\textsc {base}}$, and RoBERTa$_{\\textsc {large}}$ pre-trained models. Using BERT$_{\\textsc {base}}$ allows us to compare the results with mBERT model. Using BERT$_{\\textsc {large}}$ and RoBERTa allows us to investigate whether the performance of the target LM correlates with the performance of the source LM. We evaluate our models on two cross-lingual zero-shot tasks: (1) Cross-lingual Natural Language Inference (XNLI) and (2) dependency parsing.\nZero-shot Experiments ::: Data\nWe evaluate our approach for six target languages: French (fr), Russian (ru), Arabic (ar), Chinese (zh), Hindi (hi), and Vietnamese (vi). These languages belong to four different language families. French, Russian, and Hindi are Indo-European languages, similar to English. Arabic, Chinese, and Vietnamese belong to Afro-Asiatic, Sino-Tibetan, and Austro-Asiatic family respectively. The choice of the six languages also reflects different training conditions depending on the amount of monolingual data. French and Russian, and Arabic can be regarded as high resource languages whereas Hindi has far less data and can be considered as low resource.\nFor experiments that use parallel data to initialize foreign specific parameters, we use the same datasets in the work of BIBREF6. Specifically, we use United Nations Parallel Corpus BIBREF18 for en-ru, en-ar, en-zh, and en-fr. We collect en-hi parallel data from IIT Bombay corpus BIBREF19 and en-vi data from OpenSubtitles 2018. For experiments that use only monolingual data to initialize foreign parameters, instead of training word-vectors from the scratch, we use the pre-trained word vectors from fastText BIBREF14 to estimate word translation probabilities (Eq. DISPLAY_FORM13). We align these vectors into a common space using orthogonal Procrustes BIBREF20, BIBREF15, BIBREF16. We only use identical words between the two languages as the supervised signal. We use WikiExtractor to extract extract raw sentences from Wikipedias as monolingual data for fine-tuning target embeddings and bilingual LMs (\u00a7SECREF15). We do not lowercase or remove accents in our data preprocessing pipeline.\nWe tokenize English using the provided tokenizer from pre-trained models. For target languages, we use fastBPE to learn 30,000 BPE codes and 50,000 codes when transferring from BERT and RoBERTa respectively. We truncate the BPE vocabulary of foreign languages to match the size of the English vocabulary in the source models. Precisely, the size of foreign vocabulary is set to 32,000 when transferring from BERT and 50,000 when transferring from RoBERTa.\nWe use XNLI dataset BIBREF9 for classification task and Universal Dependencies v2.4 BIBREF21 for parsing task. Since a language might have more than one treebank in Universal Dependencies, we use the following treebanks: en_ewt (English), fr_gsd (French), ru_syntagrus (Russian) ar_padt (Arabic), vi_vtb (Vietnamese), hi_hdtb (Hindi), and zh_gsd (Chinese).\nZero-shot Experiments ::: Data ::: Remark on BPE\nBIBREF22 show that sharing subwords between languages improves alignments between embedding spaces. BIBREF2 observe a strong correlation between the percentage of overlapping subwords and mBERT's performances for cross-lingual zero-shot transfer. However, in our current approach, subwords between source and target are not shared. A subword that is in both English and foreign vocabulary has two different embeddings.\nZero-shot Experiments ::: Estimating translation probabilities\nSince pre-trained models operate on subword level, we need to estimate subword translation probabilities. Therefore, we subsample 2M sentence pairs from each parallel corpus and tokenize the data into subwords before running fast-align BIBREF13.\nEstimating subword translation probabilities from aligned word vectors requires an additional processing step since the provided vectors from fastText are not at subword level. We use the following approximation to obtain subword vectors: the vector $_s$ of subword $s$ is the weighted average of all the aligned word vectors $_{w_i}$ that have $s$ as an subword\nwhere $p(w_j)$ is the unigram probability of word $w_j$ and $n_s = \\sum _{w_j:\\, s\\in w_j} p(w_j)$. We take the top 50,000 words in each aligned word-vectors to compute subword vectors.\nIn both cases, not all the words in the foreign vocabulary can be initialized from the English word-embeddings. Those words are initialized randomly from a Gaussian $\\mathcal {N}(0, {1}{d^2})$.\nZero-shot Experiments ::: Hyper-parameters\nIn all the experiments, we tune RAMEN$_{\\textsc {base}}$ for 175,000 updates and RAMEN$_{\\textsc {large}}$ for 275,000 updates where the first 25,000 updates are for language specific parameters. The sequence length is set to 256. The mini-batch size are 64 and 24 when tuning language specific parameters using RAMEN$_{\\textsc {base}}$ and RAMEN$_{\\textsc {large}}$ respectively.

This strategy of balancing mini-batch has been used in multilingual neural machine translation BIBREF23, BIBREF24.\nWe optimize RAMEN$_{\\textsc {base}}$ using Lookahead optimizer BIBREF25 wrapped around Adam with the learning rate of $10^{-4}$, the number of fast weight updates $k=5$, and interpolation parameter $\\alpha =0.5$. We choose Lookahead optimizer because it has been shown to be robust to the initial parameters of the based optimizer (Adam). For Adam optimizer, we linearly increase the learning rate from $10^{-7}$ to $10^{-4}$ in the first 4000 updates and then follow an inverse square root decay. All RAMEN$_{\\textsc {large}}$ models are optimized with Adam due to memory limit.\nWhen fine-tuning RAMEN on XNLI and UD, we use a mini-batch size of 32, Adam's learning rate of $10^{-5}$. The number of epochs are set to 4 and 50 for XNLI and UD tasks respectively. All experiments are carried out on a single Tesla V100 16GB GPU. Each RAMEN$_{\\textsc {base}}$ model is trained within a day and each RAMEN$_{\\textsc {large}}$ is trained within two days.\nResults\nIn this section, we present the results of out models for two zero-shot cross lingual transfer tasks: XNLI and dependency parsing.\nResults ::: Cross-lingual Natural Language Inference\nTable TABREF32 shows the XNLI test accuracy.

We observe a substantial gain of 19-30 LAS for all languages except French after 50K updates.\nLanguage similarities have more impact on transferring syntax than semantics. Without tuning the English encoder, French enjoys 50.3 LAS for being closely related to English, whereas Arabic and Hindi, SOV languages, modestly reach 4.2 and 6.4 points using the SVO encoder. Although Chinese has SVO order, it is often seen as head-final while English is strong head-initial. Perhaps, this explains the poor performance for Chinese.\nLimitations\nWhile we have successfully adapted autoencoding pre-trained LMs from English to other languages, the question whether our approach can also be applied for autoregressive LM such as XLNet still remains. We leave the investigation to future work.\nConclusions\nIn this work, we have presented a simple and effective approach for rapidly building a bilingual LM under a limited computational budget. Using BERT as the starting point, we demonstrate that our approach produces better than mBERT on two cross-lingual zero-shot sentence classification and dependency parsing. We find that the performance of our bilingual LM, RAMEN, correlates with the performance of the original pre-trained English models. We also find that RAMEN is also a powerful feature extractor in supervised dependency parsing. Finally, we hope that our work sparks of interest in developing fast and effective methods for transferring pre-trained English models to other languages.", "answers": ["No data.

The core architecture of neural machine translation models is based on the general encoder-decoder approach BIBREF3 . Neural machine translation is an end-to-end approach that learns to encode source sentences into distributed representations and decode these representations into sentences in the target language. Among the different neural MT models, attentional NMT BIBREF4 , BIBREF5 has become popular due to its capability to use the most relevant parts of the source sentence at each translation step. This capability also makes the attentional model superior in translating longer sentences BIBREF4 , BIBREF5 .\nFigure FIGREF1 shows an example of how attention uses the most relevant source words to generate a target word at each step of the translation. In this paper we focus on studying the relevance of the attended parts, especially cases where attention is `smeared out' over multiple source words where their relevance is not entirely obvious, see, e.g., \u201cwould\" and \u201clike\" in Figure FIGREF1 . Here, we ask whether these are due to errors of the attention mechanism or are a desired behavior of the model.\nSince the introduction of attention models in neural machine translation BIBREF4 various modifications have been proposed BIBREF5 , BIBREF6 , BIBREF7 . However, to the best of our knowledge there is no study that provides an analysis of what kind of phenomena is being captured by attention. There are some works that have looked to attention as being similar to traditional word alignment BIBREF8 , BIBREF6 , BIBREF7 , BIBREF9 . Some of these approaches also experimented with training the attention model using traditional alignments BIBREF8 , BIBREF7 , BIBREF9 . liu-EtAl:2016:COLING have shown that attention could be seen as a reordering model as well as an alignment model.\nIn this paper, we focus on investigating the differences between attention and alignment and what is being captured by the attention mechanism in general. The questions that we are aiming to answer include: Is the attention model only capable of modelling alignment? And how similar is attention to alignment in different syntactic phenomena?\nOur analysis shows that attention models traditional alignment in some cases more closely while it captures information beyond alignment in others. For instance, attention agrees with traditional alignments to a high degree in the case of nouns. However, it captures other information rather than only the translational equivalent in the case of verbs.\nThis paper makes the following contributions: 1) We provide a detailed comparison of attention in NMT and word alignment. 2) We show that while different attention mechanisms can lead to different degrees of compliance with respect to word alignments, global compliance is not always helpful for word prediction. 3) We show that attention follows different patterns depending on the type of the word being generated. 4) We demonstrate that attention does not always comply with alignment. We provide evidence showing that the difference between attention and alignment is due to attention model capability to attend the context words influencing the current word translation.\nRelated Work\nliu-EtAl:2016:COLING investigate how training the attention model in a supervised manner can benefit machine translation quality. To this end they use traditional alignments obtained by running automatic alignment tools (GIZA++ BIBREF10 and fast_align BIBREF11 ) on the training data and feed it as ground truth to the attention network. They report some improvements in translation quality arguing that the attention model has learned to better align source and target words. The approach of training attention using traditional alignments has also been proposed by others BIBREF9 , BIBREF8 . chen2016guided show that guided attention with traditional alignment helps in the domain of e-commerce data which includes lots of out of vocabulary (OOV) product names and placeholders, but not much in the other domains. alkhouli-EtAl:2016:WMT have separated the alignment model and translation model, reasoning that this avoids propagation of errors from one model to the other as well as providing more flexibility in the model types and training of the models. They use a feed-forward neural network as their alignment model that learns to model jumps in the source side using HMM/IBM alignments obtained by using GIZA++.\nshi-padhi-knight:2016:EMNLP2016 show that various kinds of syntactic information are being learned and encoded in the output hidden states of the encoder. The neural system for their experimental analysis is not an attentional model and they argue that attention does not have any impact for learning syntactic information. However, performing the same analysis for morphological information, belinkov2017neural show that attention has also some effect on the information that the encoder of neural machine translation system encodes in its output hidden states. As part of their analysis they show that a neural machine translation system that has an attention model can learn the POS tags of the source side more efficiently than a system without attention.\nRecently, koehn2017six carried out a brief analysis of how much attention and alignment match in different languages by measuring the probability mass that attention gives to alignments obtained from an automatic alignment tool. They also report differences based on the most attended words.\nThe mixed results reported by chen2016guided, alkhouli-EtAl:2016:WMT, liu-EtAl:2016:COLING on optimizing attention with respect to alignments motivates a more thorough analysis of attention models in NMT.\nAttention Models\nThis section provides a short background on attention and discusses two most popular attention models which are also used in this paper. The first model is a non-recurrent attention model which is equivalent to the \u201cglobal attention\" method proposed by DBLPjournalscorrLuongPM15. The second attention model that we use in our investigation is an input-feeding model similar to the attention model first proposed by bahdanau-EtAl:2015:ICLR and turned to a more general one and called input-feeding by DBLPjournalscorrLuongPM15. Below we describe the details of both models.\nBoth non-recurrent and input-feeding models compute a context vector INLINEFORM0 at each time step. Subsequently, they concatenate the context vector to the hidden state of decoder and pass it through a non-linearity before it is fed into the softmax output layer of the translation network. DISPLAYFORM0\nThe difference of the two models lays in the way they compute the context vector. In the non-recurrent model, the hidden state of the decoder is compared to each hidden state of the encoder. Often, this comparison is realized as the dot product of vectors. Then the comparison result is fed to a softmax layer to compute the attention weight. DISPLAYFORM0 DISPLAYFORM1\nHere INLINEFORM0 is the hidden state of the decoder at time INLINEFORM1 , INLINEFORM2 is INLINEFORM3 th hidden state of the encoder and INLINEFORM4 is the length of the source sentence. Then the computed alignment weights are used to compute a weighted sum over the encoder hidden states which results in the context vector mentioned above: DISPLAYFORM0\nThe input-feeding model changes the context vector computation in a way that at each step INLINEFORM0 the context vector is aware of the previously computed context INLINEFORM1 . To this end, the input-feeding model feeds back its own INLINEFORM2 to the network and uses the resulting hidden state instead of the context-independent INLINEFORM3 , to compare to the hidden states of the encoder. This is defined in the following equations: DISPLAYFORM0 DISPLAYFORM1\nHere, INLINEFORM0 is the function that the stacked LSTM applies to the input, INLINEFORM1 is the last generated target word, and INLINEFORM2 is the output of previous time step of the input-feeding network itself, meaning the output of Equation EQREF2 in the case that context vector has been computed using INLINEFORM3 from Equation EQREF7 .\nComparing Attention with Alignment\nAs mentioned above, it is a commonly held assumption that attention corresponds to word alignments. To verify this, we investigate whether higher consistency between attention and alignment leads to better translations.\nMeasuring Attention-Alignment Accuracy\nIn order to compare attentions of multiple systems as well as to measure the difference between attention and word alignment, we convert the hard word alignments into soft ones and use cross entropy between attention and soft alignment as a loss function. For this purpose, we use manual alignments provided by RWTH German-English dataset as the hard alignments. The statistics of the data are given in Table TABREF8 . We convert the hard alignments to soft alignments using Equation EQREF10 . For unaligned words, we first assume that they have been aligned to all the words in the source side and then do the conversion. DISPLAYFORM0\nHere INLINEFORM0 is the set of source words aligned to target word INLINEFORM1 and INLINEFORM2 is the number of source words in the set.\nAfter conversion of the hard alignments to soft ones, we compute the attention loss as follows: DISPLAYFORM0\nHere INLINEFORM0 is the source sentence and INLINEFORM1 is the weight of the alignment link between source word INLINEFORM2 and the target word (see Equation EQREF10 ). INLINEFORM3 is the attention weight INLINEFORM4 (see Equation EQREF4 ) of the source word INLINEFORM5 , when generating the target word INLINEFORM6 .\nIn our analysis, we also look into the relation between translation quality and the quality of the attention with respect to the alignments. For measuring the quality of attention, we use the attention loss defined in Equation EQREF11 . As a measure of translation quality, we choose the loss between the output of our NMT system and the reference translation at each translation step, which we call word prediction loss. The word prediction loss for word INLINEFORM0 is logarithm of the probability given in Equation EQREF12 . DISPLAYFORM0\nHere INLINEFORM0 is the source sentence, INLINEFORM1 is target word at time step INLINEFORM2 , INLINEFORM3 is the target history given by the reference translation and INLINEFORM4 is given by Equation EQREF2 for either non-recurrent or input-feeding attention models.\nSpearman's rank correlation is used to compute the correlation between attention loss and word prediction loss: DISPLAYFORM0\nwhere INLINEFORM0 and INLINEFORM1 are the ranks of the attention losses and word prediction losses, respectively, INLINEFORM2 is the covariance between two input variables, and INLINEFORM3 and INLINEFORM4 are the standard deviations of INLINEFORM5 and INLINEFORM6 .\nIf there is a close relationship between word prediction quality and consistency of attention versus alignment, then there should be high correlation between word prediction loss and attention loss. Figure FIGREF13 shows an example with different levels of consistency between attention and word alignments. For the target words \u201cwill\" and \u201ccome\" the attention is not focused on the manually aligned word but distributed between the aligned word and other words. The focus of this paper is examining cases where attention does not follow alignment, answering the questions whether those cases represent errors or desirable behavior of the attention model.\nMeasuring Attention Concentration\nAs another informative variable in our analysis, we look into the attention concentration. While most word alignments only involve one or a few words, attention can be distributed more freely. We measure the concentration of attention by computing the entropy of the attention distribution: DISPLAYFORM0\nEmpirical Analysis of Attention Behaviour\nWe conduct our analysis using the two different attention models described in Section SECREF3 . Our first attention model is the global model without input-feeding as introduced by DBLPjournalscorrLuongPM15. The second model is the input-feeding model BIBREF5 , which uses recurrent attention. Our NMT system is a unidirectional encoder-decoder system as described in BIBREF5 , using 4 recurrent layers.\nWe trained the systems with dimension size of 1,000 and batch size of 80 for 20 epochs. The vocabulary for both source and target side is set to be the 30K most common words. The learning rate is set to be 1 and a maximum gradient norm of 5 has been used. We also use a dropout rate of 0.3 to avoid overfitting.\nImpact of Attention Mechanism\nWe train both of the systems on the WMT15 German-to-English training data, see Table TABREF18 for some statistics. Table TABREF17 shows the BLEU scores BIBREF12 for both systems on different test sets.\nSince we use POS tags and dependency roles in our analysis, both of which are based on words, we chose not to use BPE BIBREF13 which operates at the sub-word level.\nWe report alignment error rate (AER) BIBREF14 , which is commonly used to measure alignment quality, in Table TABREF20 to show the difference between attentions and human alignments provided by RWTH German-English dataset. To compute AER over attentions, we follow DBLPjournalscorrLuongPM15 to produce hard alignments from attentions by choosing the most attended source word for each target word. We also use GIZA++ BIBREF10 to produce automatic alignments over the data set to allow for a comparison between automatically generated alignments and the attentions generated by our systems. GIZA++ is run in both directions and alignments are symmetrized using the grow-diag-final-and refined alignment heuristic.\nAs shown in Table TABREF20 , the input-feeding system not only achieves a higher BLEU score, but also uses attentions that are closer to the human alignments.\nTable TABREF21 compares input-feeding and non-recurrent attention in terms of attention loss computed using Equation EQREF11 . Here the losses between the attention produced by each system and the human alignments is reported. As expected, the difference in attention losses are in line with AER.\nThe difference between these comparisons is that AER only takes the most attended word into account while attention loss considers the entire attention distribution.\nAlignment Quality Impact on Translation\nBased on the results in Section SECREF19 , one might be inclined to conclude that the closer the attention is to the word alignments the better the translation. However, chen2016guided, liu-EtAl:2016:COLING, alkhouli-EtAl:2016:WMT report mixed results by optimizing their NMT system with respect to word prediction and alignment quality. These findings warrant a more fine-grained analysis of attention. To this end, we include POS tags in our analysis and study the patterns of attention based on POS tags of the target words. We choose POS tags because they exhibit some simple syntactic characteristics. We use the coarse grained universal POS tags BIBREF15 given in Table TABREF25 .\nTo better understand how attention accuracy affects translation quality, we analyse the relationship between attention loss and word prediction loss for individual part-of-speech classes. Figure FIGREF22 shows how attention loss differs when generating different POS tags. One can see that attention loss varies substantially across different POS tags. In particular, we focus on the cases of NOUN and VERB which are the most frequent POS tags in the dataset. As shown, the attention of NOUN is the closest to alignments on average. But the average attention loss for VERB is almost two times larger than the loss for NOUN.\nConsidering this difference and the observations in Section SECREF19 , a natural follow-up would be to focus on getting the attention of verbs to be closer to alignments. However, Figure FIGREF22 shows that the average word prediction loss for verbs is actually smaller compared to the loss for nouns. In other words, although the attention for verbs is substantially more inconsistent with the word alignments than for nouns, the NMT system translates verbs more accurately than nouns on average.\nTo formalize this relationship we compute Spearman's rank correlation between word prediction loss and attention loss, based on the POS tags of the target side, for the input-feeding model, see Figure FIGREF27 .\nThe low correlation for verbs confirms that attention to other parts of source sentence rather than the aligned word is necessary for translating verbs and that attention does not necessarily have to follow alignments. However, the higher correlation for nouns means that consistency of attention with alignments is more desirable. This could, in a way, explain the mixed result reported for training attention using alignments BIBREF9 , BIBREF7 , BIBREF8 . Especially the results by chen2016guided in which large improvements are achieved for the e-commerce domain which contains many OOV product names and placeholders, but no or very weak improvements were achieved over common domains.\nAttention Concentration\nIn word alignment, most target words are aligned to one source word. The average number of source words aligned to nouns and verbs is 1.1 and 1.2 respectively. To investigate to what extent this also holds for attention we measure the attention concentration by computing the entropy of the attention distribution, see Equation EQREF16 .\nFigure FIGREF28 shows the average entropy of attention based on POS tags. As shown, nouns have one of the lowest entropies meaning that on average the attention for nouns tends to be concentrated. This also explains the closeness of the attention to alignments for nouns. In addition, the correlation between attention entropy and attention loss in case of nouns is high as shown in Figure FIGREF28 . This means that attention entropy can be used as a measure of closeness of attention to alignment in the case of nouns.\nThe higher attention entropy for verbs, in Figure FIGREF28 , shows that the attention is more distributed compared to nouns. The low correlation between attention entropy and word prediction loss (see Figure FIGREF32 ) shows that attention concentration is not required when translating into verbs. This also confirms that the correct translation of verbs requires the systems to pay attention to different parts of the source sentence.\nAnother interesting observation here is the low correlation for pronouns (PRON) and particles (PRT), see Figure FIGREF32 . As can be seen in Figure FIGREF28 , these tags have more distributed attention comparing to nouns, for example. This could either mean that the attention model does not know where to focus or it deliberately pays attention to multiple, somehow relevant, places to be able to produce a better translation. The latter is supported by the relatively low word prediction losses, shown in the Figure FIGREF22 .\nAttention Distribution\nTo further understand under which conditions attention is paid to words other than the aligned words, we study the distribution of attention over the source words. First, we measure how much attention is paid to the aligned words for each POS tag, on average. To this end, we compute the percentage of the probability mass that the attention model has assigned to aligned words for each POS tag, see Table TABREF35 .\nOne can notice that less than half of the attention is paid to alignment points for most of the POS tags. To examine how the rest of attention in each case has been distributed over the source sentence we measure the attention distribution over dependency roles in the source side. We first parse the source side of RWTH data using the ParZu parser BIBREF16 . Then we compute how the attention probability mass given to the words other than the alignment points, is distributed over dependency roles. Table TABREF33 gives the most attended roles for each POS tag. Here, we focus on POS tags discussed earlier. One can see that the most attended roles when translating to nouns include adjectives and determiners and in the case of translating to verbs, it includes auxiliary verbs, adverbs (including negation), subjects, and objects.\nConclusion\nIn this paper, we have studied attention in neural machine translation and provided an analysis of the relation between attention and word alignment. We have shown that attention agrees with traditional alignment to a certain extent. However, this differs substantially by attention mechanism and the type of the word being generated. We have shown that attention has different patterns based on the POS tag of the target word. The concentrated pattern of attention and the relatively high correlations for nouns show that training the attention with explicit alignment labels is useful for generating nouns. However, this is not the case for verbs, since the large portion of attention being paid to words other than alignment points, is already capturing other relevant information. Training attention with alignments in this case will force the attention model to forget these useful information. This explains the mixed results reported when guiding attention to comply with alignments BIBREF9 , BIBREF7 , BIBREF8 .\nAcknowledgments\nThis research was funded in part by the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO) under project numbers 639.022.213 and 612.001.218.\n\n Answer the question based on the above article as concisely as you can, using a single phrase or sentence if possible.

Table TABREF17 shows the BLEU scores BIBREF12 for both systems on different test sets.\nSince we use POS tags and dependency roles in our analysis, both of which are based on words, we chose not to use BPE BIBREF13 which operates at the sub-word level.\nWe report alignment error rate (AER) BIBREF14 , which is commonly used to measure alignment quality, in Table TABREF20 to show the difference between attentions and human alignments provided by RWTH German-English dataset. To compute AER over attentions, we follow DBLPjournalscorrLuongPM15 to produce hard alignments from attentions by choosing the most attended source word for each target word. We also use GIZA++ BIBREF10 to produce automatic alignments over the data set to allow for a comparison between automatically generated alignments and the attentions generated by our systems. GIZA++ is run in both directions and alignments are symmetrized using the grow-diag-final-and refined alignment heuristic.\nAs shown in Table TABREF20 , the input-feeding system not only achieves a higher BLEU score, but also uses attentions that are closer to the human alignments.\nTable TABREF21 compares input-feeding and non-recurrent attention in terms of attention loss computed using Equation EQREF11 . Here the losses between the attention produced by each system and the human alignments is reported. As expected, the difference in attention losses are in line with AER.\nThe difference between these comparisons is that AER only takes the most attended word into account while attention loss considers the entire attention distribution.\nAlignment Quality Impact on Translation\nBased on the results in Section SECREF19 , one might be inclined to conclude that the closer the attention is to the word alignments the better the translation. However, chen2016guided, liu-EtAl:2016:COLING, alkhouli-EtAl:2016:WMT report mixed results by optimizing their NMT system with respect to word prediction and alignment quality. These findings warrant a more fine-grained analysis of attention. To this end, we include POS tags in our analysis and study the patterns of attention based on POS tags of the target words. We choose POS tags because they exhibit some simple syntactic characteristics. We use the coarse grained universal POS tags BIBREF15 given in Table TABREF25 .\nTo better understand how attention accuracy affects translation quality, we analyse the relationship between attention loss and word prediction loss for individual part-of-speech classes. Figure FIGREF22 shows how attention loss differs when generating different POS tags. One can see that attention loss varies substantially across different POS tags. In particular, we focus on the cases of NOUN and VERB which are the most frequent POS tags in the dataset. As shown, the attention of NOUN is the closest to alignments on average. But the average attention loss for VERB is almost two times larger than the loss for NOUN.\nConsidering this difference and the observations in Section SECREF19 , a natural follow-up would be to focus on getting the attention of verbs to be closer to alignments. However, Figure FIGREF22 shows that the average word prediction loss for verbs is actually smaller compared to the loss for nouns. In other words, although the attention for verbs is substantially more inconsistent with the word alignments than for nouns, the NMT system translates verbs more accurately than nouns on average.\nTo formalize this relationship we compute Spearman's rank correlation between word prediction loss and attention loss, based on the POS tags of the target side, for the input-feeding model, see Figure FIGREF27 .\nThe low correlation for verbs confirms that attention to other parts of source sentence rather than the aligned word is necessary for translating verbs and that attention does not necessarily have to follow alignments. However, the higher correlation for nouns means that consistency of attention with alignments is more desirable. This could, in a way, explain the mixed result reported for training attention using alignments BIBREF9 , BIBREF7 , BIBREF8 . Especially the results by chen2016guided in which large improvements are achieved for the e-commerce domain which contains many OOV product names and placeholders, but no or very weak improvements were achieved over common domains.\nAttention Concentration\nIn word alignment, most target words are aligned to one source word. The average number of source words aligned to nouns and verbs is 1.1 and 1.2 respectively. To investigate to what extent this also holds for attention we measure the attention concentration by computing the entropy of the attention distribution, see Equation EQREF16 .\nFigure FIGREF28 shows the average entropy of attention based on POS tags. As shown, nouns have one of the lowest entropies meaning that on average the attention for nouns tends to be concentrated. This also explains the closeness of the attention to alignments for nouns. In addition, the correlation between attention entropy and attention loss in case of nouns is high as shown in Figure FIGREF28 . This means that attention entropy can be used as a measure of closeness of attention to alignment in the case of nouns.\nThe higher attention entropy for verbs, in Figure FIGREF28 , shows that the attention is more distributed compared to nouns. The low correlation between attention entropy and word prediction loss (see Figure FIGREF32 ) shows that attention concentration is not required when translating into verbs. This also confirms that the correct translation of verbs requires the systems to pay attention to different parts of the source sentence.\nAnother interesting observation here is the low correlation for pronouns (PRON) and particles (PRT), see Figure FIGREF32 . As can be seen in Figure FIGREF28 , these tags have more distributed attention comparing to nouns, for example. This could either mean that the attention model does not know where to focus or it deliberately pays attention to multiple, somehow relevant, places to be able to produce a better translation. The latter is supported by the relatively low word prediction losses, shown in the Figure FIGREF22 .\nAttention Distribution\nTo further understand under which conditions attention is paid to words other than the aligned words, we study the distribution of attention over the source words. First, we measure how much attention is paid to the aligned words for each POS tag, on average. To this end, we compute the percentage of the probability mass that the attention model has assigned to aligned words for each POS tag, see Table TABREF35 .\nOne can notice that less than half of the attention is paid to alignment points for most of the POS tags. To examine how the rest of attention in each case has been distributed over the source sentence we measure the attention distribution over dependency roles in the source side. We first parse the source side of RWTH data using the ParZu parser BIBREF16 . Then we compute how the attention probability mass given to the words other than the alignment points, is distributed over dependency roles. Table TABREF33 gives the most attended roles for each POS tag. Here, we focus on POS tags discussed earlier. One can see that the most attended roles when translating to nouns include adjectives and determiners and in the case of translating to verbs, it includes auxiliary verbs, adverbs (including negation), subjects, and objects.\nConclusion\nIn this paper, we have studied attention in neural machine translation and provided an analysis of the relation between attention and word alignment. We have shown that attention agrees with traditional alignment to a certain extent. However, this differs substantially by attention mechanism and the type of the word being generated. We have shown that attention has different patterns based on the POS tag of the target word. The concentrated pattern of attention and the relatively high correlations for nouns show that training the attention with explicit alignment labels is useful for generating nouns. However, this is not the case for verbs, since the large portion of attention being paid to words other than alignment points, is already capturing other relevant information. Training attention with alignments in this case will force the attention model to forget these useful information. This explains the mixed results reported when guiding attention to comply with alignments BIBREF9 , BIBREF7 , BIBREF8 .\nAcknowledgments\nThis research was funded in part by the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO) under project numbers 639.022.213 and 612.001.218.", "answers": ["For certain POS tags, e.g. VERB, PRON.", "most word alignments only involve one or a few words, attention can be distributed more freely"], "length": 3366, "dataset": "qasper_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "e7af1912d971eeb3c7f5f96c5440ef649b96bda636efa14d", "pred": " Attention differs from alignment in cases where the attention is distributed over multiple source words, such as when translating verbs."}

Labeling thousands of hours of audio, however, is expensive and time-consuming. A natural question to ask is how to achieve better generalization with fewer training examples. Active learning studies this problem by identifying and labeling only the most informative data, potentially reducing sample complexity. How much active learning can help in large-scale, end-to-end ASR systems, however, is still an open question.\nThe speech recognition community has generally identified the informativeness of samples by calculating confidence scores. In particular, an utterance is considered informative if the most likely prediction has small probability BIBREF1 , or if the predictions are distributed very uniformly over the labels BIBREF2 . Though confidence-based measures work well in practice, less attention has been focused on gradient-based methods like Expected Gradient Length (EGL) BIBREF3 , where the informativeness is measured by the norm of the gradient incurred by the instance. EGL has previously been justified as intuitively measuring the expected change in a model's parameters BIBREF3 .We formalize this intuition from the perspective of asymptotic variance reduction, and experimentally, we show EGL to be superior to confidence-based methods on speech recognition tasks. Additionally, we observe that the ranking of samples scored by EGL is not correlated with that of confidence scoring, suggesting EGL identifies aspects of an instance that confidence scores cannot capture.\nIn BIBREF3 , EGL was applied to active learning on sequence labeling tasks, but our work is the first we know of to apply EGL to speech recognition in particular. Gradient-based methods have also found applications outside active learning. For example, BIBREF4 suggests that in stochastic gradient descent, sampling training instances with probabilities proportional to their gradient lengths can speed up convergence. From the perspective of variance reduction, this importance sampling problem shares many similarities to problems found in active learning.\nProblem Formulation\nDenote INLINEFORM0 as an utterance and INLINEFORM1 the corresponding label (transcription). A speech recognition system models the conditional distribution INLINEFORM2 , where INLINEFORM3 are the parameters in the model, and INLINEFORM4 is typically implemented by a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). A training set is a collection of INLINEFORM5 pairs, denoted as INLINEFORM6 . The parameters of the model are estimated by minimizing the negative log-likelihood on the training set: DISPLAYFORM0\nActive learning seeks to augment the training set with a new set of utterances and labels INLINEFORM0 in order to achieve good generalization on a held-out test dataset. In many applications, there is an unlabeled pool INLINEFORM1 which is costly to label in its entirety. INLINEFORM2 is queried for the \u201cmost informative\u201d instance(s) INLINEFORM3 , for which the label(s) INLINEFORM4 are then obtained. We discuss several such query strategies below.\nConfidence Scores\nConfidence scoring has been used extensively as a proxy for the informativeness of training samples. Specifically, an INLINEFORM0 is considered informative if the predictions are uniformly distributed over all the labels BIBREF2 , or if the best prediction of its label is with low probability BIBREF1 . By taking the instances which \u201cconfuse\u201d the model, these methods may effectively explore under-sampled regions of the input space.\nExpected Gradient Length\nIntuitively, an instance can be considered informative if it results in large changes in model parameters. A natural measure of the change is gradient length, INLINEFORM0 . Motivated by this intuition, Expected Gradient Length (EGL) BIBREF3 picks the instances expected to have the largest gradient length. Since labels are unknown on INLINEFORM1 , EGL computes the expectation of the gradient norm over all possible labelings. BIBREF3 interprets EGL as \u201cexpected model change\u201d. In the following section, we formalize the intuition for EGL and show that it follows naturally from reducing the variance of an estimator.\nVariance in the Asymptote\nAssume the joint distribution of INLINEFORM0 has the following form, DISPLAYFORM0\nwhere INLINEFORM0 is the true parameter, and INLINEFORM1 is independent of INLINEFORM2 . By selecting a subset of the training data, we are essentially choosing another distribution INLINEFORM3 so that the INLINEFORM4 pairs are drawn from INLINEFORM5\nStatistical signal processing theory BIBREF5 states the following asymptotic distribution of INLINEFORM0 , DISPLAYFORM0\nwhere INLINEFORM0 is the Fisher Information Matrix with respect to INLINEFORM1 . Using first order approximation at INLINEFORM2 , we have asymptotically, DISPLAYFORM0\nEq. ( EQREF7 ) indicates that to reduce INLINEFORM0 on test data, we need to minimize the expected variance INLINEFORM1 over the test set. This is called Fisher Information Ratio criteria in BIBREF6 , which itself is hard to optimize. An easier surrogate is to maximize INLINEFORM2 . Substituting Eq. ( EQREF5 ) into INLINEFORM3 , we have INLINEFORM4\nwhich is equivalent to INLINEFORM0\nA practical issue is that we do not know INLINEFORM0 in advance. We could instead substitute an estimate INLINEFORM1 from a pre-trained model, where it is reasonable to assume the INLINEFORM2 to be close to the true INLINEFORM3 . The batch selection then works by taking the samples that have largest gradient norms, DISPLAYFORM0\nFor RNNs, the gradients for each potential label can be obtained by back-propagation. Another practical issue is that EGL marginalizes over all possible labelings, but in speech recognition, the number of labelings scales exponentially in the number of timesteps. Therefore, we only marginalize over the INLINEFORM0 most probable labelings. They are obtained by beam search decoding, as in BIBREF7 . The EGL method in BIBREF3 is almost the same as Eq. ( EQREF8 ), except the gradient's norm is not squared in BIBREF3 .\nHere we have provided a more formal characterization of EGL to complement its intuitive interpretation as \u201cexpected model change\u201d in BIBREF3 . For notational convenience, we denote Eq. ( EQREF8 ) as EGL in subsequent sections.\nExperiments\nWe empirically validate EGL on speech recognition tasks. In our experiments, the RNN takes in spectrograms of utterances, passing them through two 2D-convolutional layers, followed by seven bi-directional recurrent layers and a fully-connected layer with softmax activation. All recurrent layers are batch normalized. At each timestep, the softmax activations give a probability distribution over the characters. CTC loss BIBREF8 is then computed from the timestep-wise probabilities.\nA base model, INLINEFORM0 , is trained on 190 hours ( INLINEFORM1 100K instances) of transcribed speech data. Then, it selects a subset of a 1,700-hour ( INLINEFORM2 1.1M instances) unlabeled dataset. We query labels for the selected subset and incorporate them into training. Learning rates are tuned on a small validation set of 2048 instances. The trained model is then tested on a 156-hour ( INLINEFORM3 100K instances) test set and we report CTC loss, Character Error Rate (CER) and Word Error Rate (WER).\nThe confidence score methods BIBREF1 , BIBREF2 can be easily extended to our setup. Specifically, from the probabilities over the characters, we can compute an entropy per timestep and then average them. This method is denoted as entropy. We could also take the most likely prediction and calculate its CTC loss, normalized by number of timesteps. This method is denoted as pCTC (predicted CTC) in the following sections.\nWe implement EGL by marginalizing over the most likely 100 labels, and compare it with: 1) a random selection baseline, 2) entropy, and 3) pCTC. Using the same base model, each method queries a variable percentage of the unlabeled dataset. The queries are then included into training set, and the model continues training until convergence. Fig. FIGREF9 reports the metrics (Exact values are reported in Table TABREF12 in the Appendix) on the test set as the query percentage varies. All the active learning methods outperform the random baseline. Moreover, EGL shows a steeper, more rapid reduction in error than all other approaches. Specifically, when querying 20% of the unlabeled dataset, EGL has 11.58% lower CER and 11.09% lower WER relative to random. The performance of EGL at querying 20% is on par with random at 40%, suggesting that using EGL can lead to an approximate 50% decrease in data labeling.\nSimilarity between Query Methods\nIt is useful to understand how the three active learning methods differ in measuring the informativeness of an instance. To compare any two methods, we take rankings of informativeness given by these two methods, and plot them in a 2-D ranking-vs-ranking coordinate system. A plot close to the diagonal implies that these two methods evaluate informativeness in a very similar way.\nFig. FIGREF11 shows the ranking-vs-ranking plots between pCTC and entropy, EGL and entropy. We observe that pCTC rankings and entropy rankings (Fig. FIGREF11 ) are very correlated. This is likely because they are both related to model uncertainty. In contrast, EGL gives very different rankings from entropy (Fig. FIGREF11 ). This suggests EGL is able to identify aspects of an instance that uncertainty-based measurements cannot capture.\nWe further investigate the samples for which EGL and entropy yield vastly different estimates of informativeness, e.g., the elements in the red circle in Fig. FIGREF11 . These particular samples consist of short utterances containing silence (with background noise) or filler words. Further investigation is required to understand whether these samples are noisy outliers or whether they are in fact important for training end-to-end speech recognition systems.\nConclusion and Future Work\nWe formally explained EGL from a variance reduction perspective and experimentally tested its performance on end-to-end speech recognition systems. Initial experiments show a notable gain over random selection, and that it outperforms confidence score methods used in the ASR community. We also show EGL measures sample informativeness in a very different way from confidence scores, giving rise to open research questions. All the experiments reported here query all samples in a single batch. It is also worth considering the effects of querying samples in a sequential manner. In the future, we will further validate the approach with sequential queries and seek to make the informativeness measure robust to outliers.\n\n Answer the question based on the above article as concisely as you can, using a single phrase or sentence if possible.

There has been an extensive NER research on English, German, Dutch and Spanish language BIBREF1, BIBREF2, BIBREF3, BIBREF4, BIBREF5, and notable research on low resource South Asian languages like HindiBIBREF6, IndonesianBIBREF7 and other Indian languages (Kannada, Malayalam, Tamil and Telugu)BIBREF8. However, there has been no study on developing neural NER for Nepali language. In this paper, we propose a neural based Nepali NER using latest state-of-the-art architecture based on grapheme-level which doesn't require any hand-crafted features and no data pre-processing.\nRecent neural architecture like BIBREF1 is used to relax the need to hand-craft the features and need to use part-of-speech tag to determine the category of the entity. However, this architecture have been studied for languages like English, and German and not been applied to languages like Nepali which is a low resource language i.e limited data set to train the model. Traditional methods like Hidden Markov Model (HMM) with rule based approachesBIBREF9,BIBREF10, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) with manual feature-engineeringBIBREF11 have been applied but they perform poor compared to neural. However, there has been no research in Nepali NER using neural network. Therefore, we created the named entity annotated dataset partly with the help of Dataturk to train a neural model. The texts used for this dataset are collected from various daily news sources from Nepal around the year 2015-2016.\nFollowing are our contributions:\nWe present a novel Named Entity Recognizer (NER) for Nepali language. To best of our knowledge we are the first to propose neural based Nepali NER.\nAs there are not good quality dataset to train NER we release a dataset to support future research\nWe perform empirical evaluation of our model with state-of-the-art models with relative improvement of upto 10%\nIn this paper, we present works similar to ours in Section SECREF2. We describe our approach and dataset statistics in Section SECREF3 and SECREF4, followed by our experiments, evaluation and discussion in Section SECREF5, SECREF6, and SECREF7. We conclude with our observations in Section SECREF8.\nTo facilitate further research our code and dataset will be made available at github.com/link-yet-to-be-updated\nRelated Work\nThere has been a handful of research on Nepali NER task based on approaches like Support Vector Machine and gazetteer listBIBREF11 and Hidden Markov Model and gazetteer listBIBREF9,BIBREF10.\nBIBREF11 uses SVM along with features like first word, word length, digit features and gazetteer (person, organization, location, middle name, verb, designation and others). It uses one vs rest classification model to classify each word into different entity classes. However, it does not the take context word into account while training the model. Similarly, BIBREF9 and BIBREF10 uses Hidden Markov Model with n-gram technique for extracting POS-tags. POS-tags with common noun, proper noun or combination of both are combined together, then uses gazetteer list as look-up table to identify the named entities.\nResearchers have shown that the neural networks like CNNBIBREF12, RNNBIBREF13, LSTMBIBREF14, GRUBIBREF15 can capture the semantic knowledge of language better with the help of pre-trained embbeddings like word2vecBIBREF16, gloveBIBREF17 or fasttextBIBREF18.\nSimilar approaches has been applied to many South Asian languages like HindiBIBREF6, IndonesianBIBREF7, BengaliBIBREF19 and In this paper, we present the neural network architecture for NER task in Nepali language, which doesn't require any manual feature engineering nor any data pre-processing during training. First we are comparing BiLSTMBIBREF14, BiLSTM+CNNBIBREF20, BiLSTM+CRFBIBREF1, BiLSTM+CNN+CRFBIBREF2 models with CNN modelBIBREF0 and Stanford CRF modelBIBREF21. Secondly, we show the comparison between models trained on general word embeddings, word embedding + character-level embedding, word embedding + part-of-speech(POS) one-hot encoding and word embedding + grapheme clustered or sub-word embeddingBIBREF22. The experiments were performed on the dataset that we created and on the dataset received from ILPRL lab. Our extensive study shows that augmenting word embedding with character or grapheme-level representation and POS one-hot encoding vector yields better results compared to using general word embedding alone.\nApproach\nIn this section, we describe our approach in building our model. This model is partly inspired from multiple models BIBREF20,BIBREF1, andBIBREF2\nApproach ::: Bidirectional LSTM\nWe used Bi-directional LSTM to capture the word representation in forward as well as reverse direction of a sentence. Generally, LSTMs take inputs from left (past) of the sentence and computes the hidden state. However, it is proven beneficialBIBREF23 to use bi-directional LSTM, where, hidden states are computed based from right (future) of sentence and both of these hidden states are concatenated to produce the final output as $h_t$=[$\\overrightarrow{h_t}$;$\\overleftarrow{h_t}$], where $\\overrightarrow{h_t}$, $\\overleftarrow{h_t}$ = hidden state computed in forward and backward direction respectively.\nApproach ::: Features ::: Word embeddings\nWe have used Word2Vec BIBREF16, GloVe BIBREF17 and FastText BIBREF18 word vectors of 300 dimensions. These vectors were trained on the corpus obtained from Nepali National Corpus. This pre-lemmatized corpus consists of 14 million words from books, web-texts and news papers. This corpus was mixed with the texts from the dataset before training CBOW and skip-gram version of word2vec using gensim libraryBIBREF24. This trained model consists of vectors for 72782 unique words.\nLight pre-processing was performed on the corpus before training it. For example, invalid characters or characters other than Devanagari were removed but punctuation and numbers were not removed. We set the window context at 10 and the rare words whose count is below 5 are dropped. These word embeddings were not frozen during the training session because fine-tuning word embedding help achieve better performance compared to frozen oneBIBREF20.\nWe have used fasttext embeddings in particular because of its sub-word representation ability, which is very useful in highly inflectional language as shown in Table TABREF25. We have trained the word embedding in such a way that the sub-word size remains between 1 and 4. We particularly chose this size because in Nepali language a single letter can also be a word, for example e, t, C, r, l, n, u and a single character (grapheme) or sub-word can be formed after mixture of dependent vowel signs with consonant letters for example, C + O + = CO, here three different consonant letters form a single sub-word.\nThe two-dimensional visualization of an example word npAl is shown in FIGREF14. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) technique was used to generate this visualization which helps use to analyze the nearest neighbor words of a given sample word. 84 and 104 nearest neighbors were observed using word2vec and fasttext embedding respectively on the same corpus.\nApproach ::: Features ::: Character-level embeddings\nBIBREF20 and BIBREF2 successfully presented that the character-level embeddings, extracted using CNN, when combined with word embeddings enhances the NER model performance significantly, as it is able to capture morphological features of a word. Figure FIGREF7 shows the grapheme-level CNN used in our model, where inputs to CNN are graphemes. Character-level CNN is also built in similar fashion, except the inputs are characters. Grapheme or Character -level embeddings are randomly initialized from [0,1] with real values with uniform distribution of dimension 30.\nApproach ::: Features ::: Grapheme-level embeddings\nGrapheme is atomic meaningful unit in writing system of any languages. Since, Nepali language is highly morphologically inflectional, we compared grapheme-level representation with character-level representation to evaluate its effect. For example, in character-level embedding, each character of a word npAl results into n + + p + A + l has its own embedding. However, in grapheme level, a word npAl is clustered into graphemes, resulting into n + pA + l. Here, each grapheme has its own embedding. This grapheme-level embedding results good scores on par with character-level embedding in highly inflectional languages like Nepali, because graphemes also capture syntactic information similar to characters. We created grapheme clusters using uniseg package which is helpful in unicode text segmentations.\nApproach ::: Features ::: Part-of-speech (POS) one hot encoding\nWe created one-hot encoded vector of POS tags and then concatenated with pre-trained word embeddings before passing it to BiLSTM network. A sample of data is shown in figure FIGREF13.\nDataset Statistics ::: OurNepali dataset\nSince, we there was no publicly available standard Nepali NER dataset and did not receive any dataset from the previous researchers, we had to create our own dataset. This dataset contains the sentences collected from daily newspaper of the year 2015-2016. This dataset has three major classes Person (PER), Location (LOC) and Organization (ORG). Pre-processing was performed on the text before creation of the dataset, for example all punctuations and numbers besides ',', '-', '|' and '.' were removed. Currently, the dataset is in standard CoNLL-2003 IO formatBIBREF25.\nSince, this dataset is not lemmatized originally, we lemmatized only the post-positions like Ek, kO, l, mA, m, my, jF, sg, aEG which are just the few examples among 299 post positions in Nepali language. We obtained these post-positions from sanjaalcorps and added few more to match our dataset. We will be releasing this list in our github repository. We found out that lemmatizing the post-positions boosted the F1 score by almost 10%.\nIn order to label our dataset with POS-tags, we first created POS annotated dataset of 6946 sentences and 16225 unique words extracted from POS-tagged Nepali National Corpus and trained a BiLSTM model with 95.14% accuracy which was used to create POS-tags for our dataset.\nThe dataset released in our github repository contains each word in newline with space separated POS-tags and Entity-tags. The sentences are separated by empty newline. A sample sentence from the dataset is presented in table FIGREF13.\nDataset Statistics ::: ILPRL dataset\nAfter much time, we received the dataset from Bal Krishna Bal, ILPRL, KU. This dataset follows standard CoNLL-2003 IOB formatBIBREF25 with POS tags. This dataset is prepared by ILPRL Lab, KU and KEIV Technologies. Few corrections like correcting the NER tags had to be made on the dataset. The statistics of both the dataset is presented in table TABREF23.\nTable TABREF24 presents the total entities (PER, LOC, ORG and MISC) from both of the dataset used in our experiments. The dataset is divided into three parts with 64%, 16% and 20% of the total dataset into training set, development set and test set respectively.\nExperiments\nIn this section, we present the details about training our neural network. The neural network architecture are implemented using PyTorch framework BIBREF26. The training is performed on a single Nvidia Tesla P100 SXM2. We first run our experiment on BiLSTM, BiLSTM-CNN, BiLSTM-CRF BiLSTM-CNN-CRF using the hyper-parameters mentioned in Table TABREF30. The training and evaluation was done on sentence-level. The RNN variants are initialized randomly from $(-\\sqrt{k},\\sqrt{k})$ where $k=\\frac{1}{hidden\\_size}$.\nFirst we loaded our dataset and built vocabulary using torchtext library. This eased our process of data loading using its SequenceTaggingDataset class. We trained our model with shuffled training set using Adam optimizer with hyper-parameters mentioned in table TABREF30. All our models were trained on single layer of LSTM network. We found out Adam was giving better performance and faster convergence compared to Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). We chose those hyper-parameters after many ablation studies. The dropout of 0.5 is applied after LSTM layer.\nFor CNN, we used 30 different filters of sizes 3, 4 and 5. The embeddings of each character or grapheme involved in a given word, were passed through the pipeline of Convolution, Rectified Linear Unit and Max-Pooling. The resulting vectors were concatenated and applied dropout of 0.5 before passing into linear layer to obtain the embedding size of 30 for the given word. This resulting embedding is concatenated with word embeddings, which is again concatenated with one-hot POS vector.\nExperiments ::: Tagging Scheme\nCurrently, for our experiments we trained our model on IO (Inside, Outside) format for both the dataset, hence the dataset does not contain any B-type annotation unlike in BIO (Beginning, Inside, Outside) scheme.\nExperiments ::: Early Stopping\nWe used simple early stopping technique where if the validation loss does not decrease after 10 epochs, the training was stopped, else the training will run upto 100 epochs. In our experience, training usually stops around 30-50 epochs.\nExperiments ::: Hyper-parameters Tuning\nWe ran our experiment looking for the best hyper-parameters by changing learning rate from (0,1, 0.01, 0.001, 0.0001), weight decay from [$10^{-1}$, $10^{-2}$, $10^{-3}$, $10^{-4}$, $10^{-5}$, $10^{-6}$, $10^{-7}$], batch size from [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128], hidden size from [8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512 1024]. Table TABREF30 shows all other hyper-parameter used in our experiment for both of the dataset.\nExperiments ::: Effect of Dropout\nFigure FIGREF31 shows how we end up choosing 0.5 as dropout rate. When the dropout layer was not used, the F1 score are at the lowest. As, we slowly increase the dropout rate, the F1 score also gradually increases, however after dropout rate = 0.5, the F1 score starts falling down. Therefore, we have chosen 0.5 as dropout rate for all other experiments performed.\nEvaluation\nIn this section, we present the details regarding evaluation and comparison of our models with other baselines.\nTable TABREF25 shows the study of various embeddings and comparison among each other in OurNepali dataset. Here, raw dataset represents such dataset where post-positions are not lemmatized. We can observe that pre-trained embeddings significantly improves the score compared to randomly initialized embedding. We can deduce that Skip Gram models perform better compared CBOW models for word2vec and fasttext. Here, fastText_Pretrained represents the embedding readily available in fastText website, while other embeddings are trained on the Nepali National Corpus as mentioned in sub-section SECREF11. From this table TABREF25, we can clearly observe that model using fastText_Skip Gram embeddings outperforms all other models.\nTable TABREF35 shows the model architecture comparison between all the models experimented. The features used for Stanford CRF classifier are words, letter n-grams of upto length 6, previous word and next word. This model is trained till the current function value is less than $1\\mathrm {e}{-2}$. The hyper-parameters of neural network experiments are set as shown in table TABREF30. Since, word embedding of character-level and grapheme-level is random, their scores are near.\nAll models are evaluated using CoNLL-2003 evaluation scriptBIBREF25 to calculate entity-wise precision, recall and f1 score.\nDiscussion\nIn this paper we present that we can exploit the power of neural network to train the model to perform downstream NLP tasks like Named Entity Recognition even in Nepali language. We showed that the word vectors learned through fasttext skip gram model performs better than other word embedding because of its capability to represent sub-word and this is particularly important to capture morphological structure of words and sentences in highly inflectional like Nepali. This concept can come handy in other Devanagari languages as well because the written scripts have similar syntactical structure.\nWe also found out that stemming post-positions can help a lot in improving model performance because of inflectional characteristics of Nepali language. So when we separate out its inflections or morphemes, we can minimize the variations of same word which gives its root word a stronger word vector representations compared to its inflected versions.\nWe can clearly imply from tables TABREF23, TABREF24, and TABREF35 that we need more data to get better results because OurNepali dataset volume is almost ten times bigger compared to ILPRL dataset in terms of entities.\nConclusion and Future work\nIn this paper, we proposed a novel NER for Nepali language and achieved relative improvement of upto 10% and studies different factors effecting the performance of the NER for Nepali language.\nWe also present a neural architecture BiLSTM+CNN(grapheme-level) which turns out to be performing on par with BiLSTM+CNN(character-level) under the same configuration. We believe this will not only help Nepali language but also other languages falling under the umbrellas of Devanagari languages. Our model BiLSTM+CNN(grapheme-level) and BiLSTM+CNN(G)+POS outperforms all other model experimented in OurNepali and ILPRL dataset respectively.\nSince this is the first named entity recognition research in Nepal language using neural network, there are many rooms for improvement. We believe initializing the grapheme-level embedding with fasttext embeddings might help boosting the performance, rather than randomly initializing it. In future, we plan to apply other latest techniques like BERT, ELMo and FLAIR to study its effect on low-resource language like Nepali. We also plan to improve the model using cross-lingual or multi-lingual parameter sharing techniques by jointly training with other Devanagari languages like Hindi and Bengali.\nFinally, we would like to contribute our dataset to Nepali NLP community to move forward the research going on in language understanding domain. We believe there should be special committee to create and maintain such dataset for Nepali NLP and organize various competitions which would elevate the NLP research in Nepal.\nSome of the future works are listed below:\nProper initialization of grapheme level embedding from fasttext embeddings.\nApply robust POS-tagger for Nepali dataset\nLemmatize the OurNepali dataset with robust and efficient lemmatizer\nImprove Nepali language score with cross-lingual learning techniques\nCreate more dataset using Wikipedia/Wikidata framework\nAcknowledgments\nThe authors of this paper would like to express sincere thanks to Bal Krishna Bal, Kathmandu University Professor for providing us the POS-tagged Nepali NER data.\n\n Answer the question based on the above article as concisely as you can, using a single phrase or sentence if possible. If the question cannot be answered based on the information in the article, write \"unanswerable\". If the question is a yes/no question, answer \"yes\", \"no\", or \"unanswerable\". Do not provide any explanation.\n\nQuestion: What is the baseline?\n\nAnswer:", "input": "What is the baseline?", "context": "Introduction\nNamed Entity Recognition (NER) is a foremost NLP task to label each atomic elements of a sentence into specific categories like \"PERSON\", \"LOCATION\", \"ORGANIZATION\" and othersBIBREF0. There has been an extensive NER research on English, German, Dutch and Spanish language BIBREF1, BIBREF2, BIBREF3, BIBREF4, BIBREF5, and notable research on low resource South Asian languages like HindiBIBREF6, IndonesianBIBREF7 and other Indian languages (Kannada, Malayalam, Tamil and Telugu)BIBREF8. However, there has been no study on developing neural NER for Nepali language. In this paper, we propose a neural based Nepali NER using latest state-of-the-art architecture based on grapheme-level which doesn't require any hand-crafted features and no data pre-processing.\nRecent neural architecture like BIBREF1 is used to relax the need to hand-craft the features and need to use part-of-speech tag to determine the category of the entity. However, this architecture have been studied for languages like English, and German and not been applied to languages like Nepali which is a low resource language i.e limited data set to train the model. Traditional methods like Hidden Markov Model (HMM) with rule based approachesBIBREF9,BIBREF10, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) with manual feature-engineeringBIBREF11 have been applied but they perform poor compared to neural. However, there has been no research in Nepali NER using neural network. Therefore, we created the named entity annotated dataset partly with the help of Dataturk to train a neural model. The texts used for this dataset are collected from various daily news sources from Nepal around the year 2015-2016.\nFollowing are our contributions:\nWe present a novel Named Entity Recognizer (NER) for Nepali language. To best of our knowledge we are the first to propose neural based Nepali NER.\nAs there are not good quality dataset to train NER we release a dataset to support future research\nWe perform empirical evaluation of our model with state-of-the-art models with relative improvement of upto 10%\nIn this paper, we present works similar to ours in Section SECREF2. We describe our approach and dataset statistics in Section SECREF3 and SECREF4, followed by our experiments, evaluation and discussion in Section SECREF5, SECREF6, and SECREF7. We conclude with our observations in Section SECREF8.\nTo facilitate further research our code and dataset will be made available at github.com/link-yet-to-be-updated\nRelated Work\nThere has been a handful of research on Nepali NER task based on approaches like Support Vector Machine and gazetteer listBIBREF11 and Hidden Markov Model and gazetteer listBIBREF9,BIBREF10.\nBIBREF11 uses SVM along with features like first word, word length, digit features and gazetteer (person, organization, location, middle name, verb, designation and others). It uses one vs rest classification model to classify each word into different entity classes. However, it does not the take context word into account while training the model. Similarly, BIBREF9 and BIBREF10 uses Hidden Markov Model with n-gram technique for extracting POS-tags. POS-tags with common noun, proper noun or combination of both are combined together, then uses gazetteer list as look-up table to identify the named entities.\nResearchers have shown that the neural networks like CNNBIBREF12, RNNBIBREF13, LSTMBIBREF14, GRUBIBREF15 can capture the semantic knowledge of language better with the help of pre-trained embbeddings like word2vecBIBREF16, gloveBIBREF17 or fasttextBIBREF18.\nSimilar approaches has been applied to many South Asian languages like HindiBIBREF6, IndonesianBIBREF7, BengaliBIBREF19 and In this paper, we present the neural network architecture for NER task in Nepali language, which doesn't require any manual feature engineering nor any data pre-processing during training. First we are comparing BiLSTMBIBREF14, BiLSTM+CNNBIBREF20, BiLSTM+CRFBIBREF1, BiLSTM+CNN+CRFBIBREF2 models with CNN modelBIBREF0 and Stanford CRF modelBIBREF21. Secondly, we show the comparison between models trained on general word embeddings, word embedding + character-level embedding, word embedding + part-of-speech(POS) one-hot encoding and word embedding + grapheme clustered or sub-word embeddingBIBREF22. The experiments were performed on the dataset that we created and on the dataset received from ILPRL lab. Our extensive study shows that augmenting word embedding with character or grapheme-level representation and POS one-hot encoding vector yields better results compared to using general word embedding alone.\nApproach\nIn this section, we describe our approach in building our model.

It is an important task and can be applied to several real-world applications. Many methods have been proposed to solve the text summarization problem BIBREF0 , BIBREF1 , BIBREF2 , BIBREF3 . There are two main text summarization techniques: extractive and abstractive. Extractive summarization generates summary by selecting salient sentences or phrases from the source text, while abstractive methods paraphrase and restructure sentences to compose the summary. We focus on abstractive summarization in this work as it is more flexible and thus can generate more diverse summaries.\nRecently, many abstractive approaches are introduced based on neural sequence-to-sequence framework BIBREF4 , BIBREF0 , BIBREF3 , BIBREF5 . Based on the sequence-to-sequence model with copy mechanism BIBREF6 , BIBREF0 incorporates a coverage vector to track and control attention scores on source text. BIBREF4 introduce intra-temporal attention processes in the encoder and decoder to address the repetition and incoherent problem.\nThere are two issues in previous abstractive methods: 1) these methods use left-context-only decoder, thus do not have complete context when predicting each word. 2) they do not utilize the pre-trained contextualized language models on the decoder side, so it is more difficult for the decoder to learn summary representations, context interactions and language modeling together.\nRecently, BERT has been successfully used in various natural language processing tasks, such as textual entailment, name entity recognition and machine reading comprehensions. In this paper, we present a novel natural language generation model based on pre-trained language models (we use BERT in this work). As far as we know, this is the first work to extend BERT to the sequence generation task. To address the above issues of previous abstractive methods, in our model, we design a two-stage decoding process to make good use of BERT's context modeling ability. On the first stage, we generate the summary using a left-context-only-decoder. On the second stage, we mask each word of the summary and predict the refined word one-by-one using a refine decoder. To further improve the naturalness of the generated sequence, we cooperate reinforcement objective with the refine decoder.\nThe main contributions of this work are:\n1. We propose a natural language generation model based on BERT, making good use of the pre-trained language model in the encoder and decoder process, and the model can be trained end-to-end without handcrafted features.\n2. We design a two-stage decoder process. In this architecture, our model can generate each word of the summary considering both sides' context information.\n3. We conduct experiments on the benchmark datasets CNN/Daily Mail and New York Times. Our model achieves a 33.33 average of ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2 and ROUGE-L on the CNN/Daily Mail, which is state-of-the-art. On the New York Times dataset, our model achieves about 5.6% relative improvement over ROUGE-1.\nText Summarization\nIn this paper, we focus on single-document multi-sentence summarization and propose a supervised abstractive model based on the neural attentive sequence-to-sequence framework which consists of two parts: a neural network for the encoder and another network for the decoder. The encoder encodes the input sequence to intermediate representation and the decoder predicts one word at a time step given the input sequence representation vector and previous decoded output. The goal of the model is to maximize the probability of generating the correct target sequences. In the encoding and generation process, the attention mechanism is used to concentrate on the most important positions of text. The learning objective of most sequence-to-sequence models is to minimize the negative log likelihood of the generated sequence as following equation shows, where $y^*_i$ is the i-th ground-truth summary token.\n$$Loss = - \\log \\sum _{t=1}^N P(y_t^*|y_{<t}^*, X)$$   (Eq. 3)\nHowever, with this objective, traditional sequence generation models consider only one direction context in the decoding process, which could cause performance degradation since complete context of one token contains preceding and following tokens, thus feeding only preceded decoded words to the decoder so that the model may generate unnatural sequences. For example, attentive sequence-to-sequence models often generate sequences with repeated phrases which harm the naturalness. Some previous works mitigate this problem by improving the attention calculation process, but in this paper we show that feeding bi-directional context instead of left-only-context can better alleviate this problem.\nText summarization models are usually classified to abstractive and extractive ones. Recently, extractive models like DeepChannel BIBREF8 , rnn-ext+RL BIBREF9 and NeuSUM BIBREF2 achieve higher performances using well-designed structures. For example, DeepChannel propose a salience estimation network and iteratively extract salient sentences. BIBREF16 train a sentence compression model to teach another latent variable extractive model.\nAlso, several recent works focus on improving abstractive methods. BIBREF3 design a content selector to over-determine phrases in a source document that should be part of the summary. BIBREF11 introduce inconsistency loss to force words in less attended sentences(which determined by extractive model) to have lower generation probabilities. BIBREF5 extend seq2seq model with an information selection network to generate more informative summaries.\nBi-Directional Pre-Trained Context Encoders\nRecently, context encoders such as ELMo, GPT, and BERT have been widely used in many NLP tasks. These models are pre-trained on a huge unlabeled corpus and can generate better contextualized token embeddings, thus the approaches built on top of them can achieve better performance.\nSince our method is based on BERT, we illustrate the process briefly here. BERT consists of several layers. In each layer there is first a multi-head self-attention sub-layer and then a linear affine sub-layer with the residual connection. In each self-attention sub-layer the attention scores $e_{ij}$ are first calculated as Eq. ( 5 ) () shows, in which $d_e$ is output dimension, and $W^Q, W^K, W^V$ are parameter matrices.\n$$&a_{ij} = \\cfrac{(h_iW_Q)(h_jW_K)^T}{\\sqrt{d_e}}  \\\\ &e_{ij} = \\cfrac{\\exp {e_{ij}}}{\\sum _{k=1}^N\\exp {e_{ik}}} $$   (Eq. 5)\nThen the output is calculated as Eq. ( 6 ) shows, which is the weighted sum of previous outputs $h$ added by previous output $h_i$ . The last layer outputs is context encoding of input sequence.\n$$o_i = h_i + \\sum _{j=1}^{N} e_{ij}(h_j W_V) $$   (Eq. 6)\nDespite the wide usage and huge success, there is also a mismatch problem between these pre-trained context encoders and sequence-to-sequence models. The issue is that while using a pre-trained context encoder like GPT or BERT, they model token-level representations by conditioning on both direction context. During pre-training, they are fed with complete sequences. However, with a left-context-only decoder, these pre-trained language models will suffer from incomplete and inconsistent context and thus cannot generate good enough context-aware word representations, especially during the inference process.\nModel\nIn this section, we describe the structure of our model, which learns to generate an abstractive multi-sentence summary from a given source document.\nBased on the sequence-to-sequence framework built on top of BERT, we first design a refine decoder at word-level to tackle the two problems described in the above section. We also introduce a discrete objective for the refine decoders to reduce the exposure bias problem. The overall structure of our model is illustrated in Figure 1 .\nProblem Formulation\nWe denote the input document as $X = \\lbrace x_1, \\ldots , x_m\\rbrace $ where $x_i \\in \\mathcal {X}$ represents one source token. The corresponding summary is denoted as $Y = \\lbrace y_1, \\ldots , y_L\\rbrace $ , $L$ represents the summary length.\nGiven input document $X$ , we first predict the summary draft by a left-context-only decoder, and then using the generated summary draft we can condition on both context sides and refine the content of the summary. The draft will guide and constrain the refine process of summary.\nSummary Draft Generation\nThe summary draft is based on the sequence-to-sequence model. On the encoder side the input document $X$ is encoded into representation vectors $H = \\lbrace h_1, \\ldots , h_m\\rbrace $ , and then fed to the decoder to generate the summary draft $A = \\lbrace a_1, \\ldots , a_{|a|}\\rbrace $ .\nWe simply use BERT as the encoder. It first maps the input sequence to word embeddings and then computes document embeddings as the encoder's output, denoted by following equation.\n$$H = BERT(x_1, \\ldots , x_m)$$   (Eq. 10)\nIn the draft decoder, we first introduce BERT's word embedding matrix to map the previous summary draft outputs $\\lbrace y_1, \\ldots , y_{t-1}\\rbrace $ into embeddings vectors $\\lbrace q_1, \\ldots , q_{t-1}\\rbrace $ at t-th time step. Note that as the input sequence of the decoder is not complete, we do not use the BERT network to predict the context vectors here.\nThen we introduce an $N$ layer Transformer decoder to learn the conditional probability $P(A|H)$ . Transformer's decoder-encoder multi-head attention helps the decoder learn soft alignments between summary and source document. At the t-th time step, the draft decoder predicts output probability conditioned on previous outputs and encoder hidden representations as Eq. ( 13 ) shows, in which $q_{<t} = \\lbrace q_1, \\ldots , q_{t-1}\\rbrace $ . Each generated sequence will be truncated in the first position of a special token '[PAD]'.\n$$&P^{vocab}_t(w) = f_{dec}(q_{<t}, H)  \\\\ &L_{dec} = \\sum _{i=1}^{|a|} -\\log P(a_i = y_i^*|a_{< i}, H) $$   (Eq. 13)\nAs Eq. () shows, the decoder's learning objective is to minimize negative likelihood of conditional probability, in which $y_i^*$ is the i-th ground truth word of summary.\nHowever a decoder with this structure is not sufficient enough: if we use the BERT network in this decoder, then during training and inference, in-complete context(part of sentence) is fed into the BERT module, and although we can fine-tune BERT's parameters, the input distribution is quite different from the pre-train process, and thus harms the quality of generated context representations.\nIf we just use the embedding matrix here, it will be more difficult for the decoder with fresh parameters to learn to model representations as well as vocabulary probabilities, from a relative small corpus compared to BERT's huge pre-training corpus. In a word, the decoder cannot utilize BERT's ability to generate high quality context vectors, which will also harm performance.\nThis issue exists when using any other contextualized word representations, so we design a refine process to mitigate it in our approach which will be described in the next sub-section.\nAs some summary tokens are out-of-vocabulary words and occurs in input document, we incorporate copy mechanism BIBREF6 based on the Transformer decoder, we will describe it briefly.\nAt decoder time step $t$ , we first calculate the attention probability distribution over source document $X$ using the bi-linear dot product of the last layer decoder output of Transformer $o_t$ and the encoder output $h_j$ , as Eq. ( 15 ) () shows.\n$$u_t^j =& o_t W_c h_j \\\\ \\alpha _t^j =& \\cfrac{\\exp {u_t^j}}{\\sum _{k=1}^N\\exp {u_t^k}} $$   (Eq. 15)\nWe then calculate copying gate $g_t\\in [0, 1]$ , which makes a soft choice between selecting from source and generating from vocabulary, $W_c, W_g, b_g$ are parameters:\n$$g_t = sigmoid(W_g \\cdot [o_t, h] + b_g) $$   (Eq. 16)\nUsing $g_t$ we calculate the weighted sum of copy probability and generation probability to get the final predicted probability of extended vocabulary $\\mathcal {V} + \\mathcal {X}$ , where $\\mathcal {X}$ is the set of out of vocabulary words from the source document. The final probability is calculated as follow:\n$$P_t(w) = (1-g_t)P_t^{vocab}(w) + g_t\\sum _{i:w_i=w} \\alpha _t^i$$   (Eq. 17)\nSummary Refine Process\nThe main reason to introduce the refine process is to enhance the decoder using BERT's contextualized representations, so we do not modify the encoder and reuse it during this process.\nOn the decoder side, we propose a new word-level refine decoder. The refine decoder receives a generated summary draft as input, and outputs a refined summary. It first masks each word in the summary draft one by one, then feeds the draft to BERT to generate context vectors. Finally it predicts a refined summary word using an $N$ layer Transformer decoder which is the same as the draft decoder. At t-th time step the n-th word of input summary is masked, and the decoder predicts the n-th refined word given other words of the summary.\nThe learning objective of this process is shown in Eq. ( 19 ), $y_i$ is the i-th summary word and $y_{i}^*$ for the ground-truth summary word, and $a_{\\ne i} = \\lbrace a_1, \\ldots , a_{i-1}, a_{i+1}, \\ldots , a_{|y|}\\rbrace $ .\n$$L_{refine} = \\sum _{i=1}^{|y|} -\\log P(y_i = y_i^*|a_{\\ne i}, H) $$   (Eq. 19)\nFrom the view of BERT or other contextualized embeddings, the refine decoding process provides a more complete input sequence which is consistent with their pre-training processes. Intuitively, this process works as follows: first the draft decoder writes a summary draft based on a document, and then the refine decoder edits the draft. It concentrates on one word at a time, based on the source document as well as other words.\nWe design the word-level refine decoder because this process is similar to the cloze task in BERT's pre-train process, therefore by using the ability of the contextual language model the decoder can generate more fluent and natural sequences.\nThe parameters are shared between the draft decoder and refine decoder, as we find that using individual parameters the model's performance degrades a lot. The reason may be that we use teach-forcing during training, and thus the word-level refine decoder learns to predict words given all the other ground-truth words of summary. This objective is similar to the language model's pre-train objective, and is probably not enough for the decoder to learn to generate refined summaries. So in our model all decoders share the same parameters.\nResearchers usually use ROUGE as the evaluation metric for summarization, however during sequence-to-sequence model training, the objective is to maximize the log likelihood of generated sequences. This mis-match harms the model's performance, so we add a discrete objective to the model, and optimize it by introducing the policy gradient method. For example, the discrete objective for the summary draft process is as Eq. ( 21 ) shows, where $a^s$ is the draft summary sampled from predicted distribution, and $R(a^s)$ is the reward score compared with the ground-truth summary, we use ROUGE-L in our experiment. To balance between optimizing the discrete objective and generating readable sequences, we mix the discrete objective with maximum-likelihood objective. As Eq. () shows, minimizing $\\hat{L}_{dec}$ is the final objective for the draft process, note here $L_{dec}$ is $-logP(a|x)$ . In the refine process we introduce similar objectives.\n$$L^{rl}_{dec} = R(a^s)\\cdot [-\\log (P(a^s|x))]  \\\\ \\hat{L}_{dec} = \\gamma * L^{rl}_{dec} + (1 - \\gamma ) * L_{dec} $$   (Eq. 21)\nLearning and Inference\nDuring model training, the objective of our model is sum of the two processes, jointly trained using \"teacher-forcing\" algorithm. During training we feed the ground-truth summary to each decoder and minimize the objective.\n$$L_{model} = \\hat{L}_{dec} + \\hat{L}_{refine}$$   (Eq. 23)\nAt test time, each time step we choose the predicted word by $\\hat{y} = argmax_{y^{\\prime }} P(y^{\\prime }|x)$ , use beam search to generate the draft summaries, and use greedy search to generate the refined summaries.\nSettings\nIn this work, all of our models are built on $BERT_{BASE}$ , although another larger pre-trained model with better performance ( $BERT_{LARGE}$ ) has published but it costs too much time and GPU memory. We use WordPiece embeddings with a 30,000 vocabulary which is the same as BERT. We set the layer of transformer decoders to 12(8 on NYT50), and set the attention heads number to 12(8 on NYT50), set fully-connected sub-layer hidden size to 3072. We train the model using an Adam optimizer with learning rate of $3e-4$ , $\\beta _1=0.9$ , $\\beta _2=0.999$ and $\\epsilon =10^{-9}$ and use a dynamic learning rate during the training process. For regularization, we use dropout BIBREF13 and label smoothing BIBREF14 in our models and set the dropout rate to 0.15, and the label smoothing value to 0.1. We set the RL objective factor $\\gamma $ to 0.99.\nDuring training, we set the batch size to 36, and train for 4 epochs(8 epochs for NYT50 since it has many fewer training samples), after training the best model are selected from last 10 models based on development set performance. Due to GPU memory limit, we use gradient accumulation, set accumulate step to 12 and feed 3 samples at each step. We use beam size 4 and length penalty of 1.0 to generate logical form sequences.\nWe filter repeated tri-grams in beam-search process by setting word probability to zero if it will generate an tri-gram which exists in the existing summary. It is a nice method to avoid phrase repetition since the two datasets seldom contains repeated tri-grams in one summary. We also fine tune the generated sequences using another two simple rules. When there are multi summary sentences with exactly the same content, we keep the first one and remove the other sentences; we also remove sentences with less than 3 words from the result.\nTo evaluate the performance of our model, we conduct experiments on CNN/Daily Mail dataset, which is a large collection of news articles and modified for summarization. Following BIBREF0 we choose the non-anonymized version of the dataset, which consists of more than 280,000 training samples and 11490 test set samples.\nWe also conduct experiments on the New York Times(NYT) dataset which also consists of many news articles. The original dataset can be applied here. In our experiment, we follow the dataset splits and other pre-process settings of BIBREF15 . We first filter all samples without a full article text or abstract and then remove all samples with summaries shorter than 50 words. Then we choose the test set based on the date of publication(all examples published after January 1, 2007). The final dataset contains 22,000 training samples and 3,452 test samples and is called NYT50 since all summaries are longer than 50 words.\nWe tokenize all sequences of the two datasets using the WordPiece tokenizer. After tokenizing, the average article length and summary length of CNN/Daily Mail are 691 and 51, and NYT50's average article length and summary length are 1152 and 75. We truncate the article length to 512, and the summary length to 100 in our experiment(max summary length is set to 150 on NYT50 as its average golden summary length is longer).\nOn CNN/Daily Mail dataset, we report the full-length F-1 score of the ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2 and ROUGE-L metrics, calculated using PyRouge package and the Porter stemmer option. On NYT50, following BIBREF4 we evaluate limited length ROUGE recall score(limit the generated summary length to the ground truth length). We split NYT50 summaries into sentences by semicolons to calculate the ROUGE scores.\nResults and Analysis\nTable 1 shows the results on CNN/Daily Mail dataset, we compare the performance of many recent approaches with our model. We classify them to two groups based on whether they are extractive or abstractive models. As the last line of the table shows, the ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-2 score of our full model is comparable with DCA, and outperforms on ROUGE-L. Also, compared to extractive models NeuSUM and MASK- $LM^{global}$ , we achieve slight higher ROUGE-1. Except the four scores, our model outperforms these models on all the other scores, and since we have 95% confidence interval of at most $\\pm $ 0.20, these improvements are statistically significant.\nAs the last four lines of Table 1 show, we conduct an ablation study on our model variants to analyze the importance of each component. We use three ablation models for the experiments. One-Stage: A sequence-to-sequence model with copy mechanism based on BERT; Two-Stage: Adding the word-refine decoder to the One-Stage model; Two-Stage + RL: Full model with refine process cooperated with RL objective.\nFirst, we compare the Two-Stage+RL model with Two-Stage ablation, we observe that the full model outperforms by 0.30 on average ROUGE, suggesting that the reinforcement objective helps the model effectively. Then we analyze the effect of refine process by removing word-level refine from the Two-Stage model, we observe that without the refine process the average ROUGE score drops by 1.69. The ablation study shows that each module is necessary for our full model, and the improvements are statistically significant on all metrics.\nTo evaluate the impact of summary length on model performance, we compare the average rouge score improvements of our model with different length of ground-truth summaries. As the above sub-figure of Figure 2 shows, compared to Pointer-Generator with Coverage, on length interval 40-80(occupies about 70% of test set) the improvements of our model are higher than shorter samples, confirms that with better context representations, in longer documents our model can achieve higher performance.\nAs the below sub-figure of Figure 2 shows, compared to extractive baseline: Lead-3 BIBREF0 , the advantage of our model will fall when golden summary length is greater than 80. This probably because that we truncate the long documents and golden summaries and cannot get full information, it could also because that the training data in these intervals is too few to train an abstractive model, so simple extractive method will not fall too far behind.\nAdditional Results on NYT50\nTable 2 shows experiments on the NYT50 corpus. Since the short summary samples are filtered, NYT50 has average longer summaries than CNN/Daily Mail. So the model needs to catch long-term dependency of the sequences to generate good summaries.\nThe first two lines of Table 2 show results of the two baselines introduced by BIBREF15 : these baselines select first n sentences, or select the first k words from the original document. Also we compare performance of our model with two recent models, we see 2.39 ROUGE-1 improvements compared to the ML+RL with intra-attn approach(previous SOTA) carries over to this dataset, which is a large margin. On ROUGE-2, our model also get an improvement of 0.51. The experiment proves that our approach can outperform competitive methods on different data distributions.\nPre-trained language models\nPre-trained word vectors BIBREF17 , BIBREF18 , BIBREF19 have been widely used in many NLP tasks. More recently, pre-trained language models (ELMo, GPT and BERT), have also achieved great success on several NLP problems such as textual entailment, semantic similarity, reading comprehension, and question answering BIBREF20 , BIBREF21 , BIBREF22 .\nSome recent works also focus on leveraging pre-trained language models in summarization. BIBREF23 pretrain a language model and use it as the sentiment analyser when generating reviews of goods. BIBREF24 train a language model on golden summaries, and then use it on the decoder side to incorporate prior knowledge.\nIn this work, we use BERT(which is a pre-trained language model using large scale unlabeled data) on the encoder and decoder of a seq2seq model, and by designing a two stage decoding structure we build a competitive model for abstractive text summarization.\nConclusion and Future Work\nIn this work, we propose a two-stage model based on sequence-to-sequence paradigm. Our model utilize BERT on both encoder and decoder sides, and introduce reinforce objective in learning process. We evaluate our model on two benchmark datasets CNN/Daily Mail and New York Times, the experimental results show that compared to previous systems our approach effectively improves performance.\nAlthough our experiments are conducted on summarization task, our model can be used in most natural language generation tasks, such as machine translation, question generation and paraphrasing. The refine decoder and mixed objective can also be applied on other sequence generation tasks, and we will investigate on them in future work.\n\n Answer the question based on the above article as concisely as you can, using a single phrase or sentence if possible.

( 5 ) () shows, in which $d_e$ is output dimension, and $W^Q, W^K, W^V$ are parameter matrices.\n$$&a_{ij} = \\cfrac{(h_iW_Q)(h_jW_K)^T}{\\sqrt{d_e}}  \\\\ &e_{ij} = \\cfrac{\\exp {e_{ij}}}{\\sum _{k=1}^N\\exp {e_{ik}}} $$   (Eq. 5)\nThen the output is calculated as Eq. ( 6 ) shows, which is the weighted sum of previous outputs $h$ added by previous output $h_i$ . The last layer outputs is context encoding of input sequence.\n$$o_i = h_i + \\sum _{j=1}^{N} e_{ij}(h_j W_V) $$   (Eq. 6)\nDespite the wide usage and huge success, there is also a mismatch problem between these pre-trained context encoders and sequence-to-sequence models. The issue is that while using a pre-trained context encoder like GPT or BERT, they model token-level representations by conditioning on both direction context. During pre-training, they are fed with complete sequences. However, with a left-context-only decoder, these pre-trained language models will suffer from incomplete and inconsistent context and thus cannot generate good enough context-aware word representations, especially during the inference process.\nModel\nIn this section, we describe the structure of our model, which learns to generate an abstractive multi-sentence summary from a given source document.\nBased on the sequence-to-sequence framework built on top of BERT, we first design a refine decoder at word-level to tackle the two problems described in the above section. We also introduce a discrete objective for the refine decoders to reduce the exposure bias problem. The overall structure of our model is illustrated in Figure 1 .\nProblem Formulation\nWe denote the input document as $X = \\lbrace x_1, \\ldots , x_m\\rbrace $ where $x_i \\in \\mathcal {X}$ represents one source token. The corresponding summary is denoted as $Y = \\lbrace y_1, \\ldots , y_L\\rbrace $ , $L$ represents the summary length.\nGiven input document $X$ , we first predict the summary draft by a left-context-only decoder, and then using the generated summary draft we can condition on both context sides and refine the content of the summary. The draft will guide and constrain the refine process of summary.\nSummary Draft Generation\nThe summary draft is based on the sequence-to-sequence model. On the encoder side the input document $X$ is encoded into representation vectors $H = \\lbrace h_1, \\ldots , h_m\\rbrace $ , and then fed to the decoder to generate the summary draft $A = \\lbrace a_1, \\ldots , a_{|a|}\\rbrace $ .\nWe simply use BERT as the encoder. It first maps the input sequence to word embeddings and then computes document embeddings as the encoder's output, denoted by following equation.\n$$H = BERT(x_1, \\ldots , x_m)$$   (Eq. 10)\nIn the draft decoder, we first introduce BERT's word embedding matrix to map the previous summary draft outputs $\\lbrace y_1, \\ldots , y_{t-1}\\rbrace $ into embeddings vectors $\\lbrace q_1, \\ldots , q_{t-1}\\rbrace $ at t-th time step. Note that as the input sequence of the decoder is not complete, we do not use the BERT network to predict the context vectors here.\nThen we introduce an $N$ layer Transformer decoder to learn the conditional probability $P(A|H)$ . Transformer's decoder-encoder multi-head attention helps the decoder learn soft alignments between summary and source document. At the t-th time step, the draft decoder predicts output probability conditioned on previous outputs and encoder hidden representations as Eq. ( 13 ) shows, in which $q_{<t} = \\lbrace q_1, \\ldots , q_{t-1}\\rbrace $ . Each generated sequence will be truncated in the first position of a special token '[PAD]'.\n$$&P^{vocab}_t(w) = f_{dec}(q_{<t}, H)  \\\\ &L_{dec} = \\sum _{i=1}^{|a|} -\\log P(a_i = y_i^*|a_{< i}, H) $$   (Eq. 13)\nAs Eq. () shows, the decoder's learning objective is to minimize negative likelihood of conditional probability, in which $y_i^*$ is the i-th ground truth word of summary.\nHowever a decoder with this structure is not sufficient enough: if we use the BERT network in this decoder, then during training and inference, in-complete context(part of sentence) is fed into the BERT module, and although we can fine-tune BERT's parameters, the input distribution is quite different from the pre-train process, and thus harms the quality of generated context representations.\nIf we just use the embedding matrix here, it will be more difficult for the decoder with fresh parameters to learn to model representations as well as vocabulary probabilities, from a relative small corpus compared to BERT's huge pre-training corpus. In a word, the decoder cannot utilize BERT's ability to generate high quality context vectors, which will also harm performance.\nThis issue exists when using any other contextualized word representations, so we design a refine process to mitigate it in our approach which will be described in the next sub-section.\nAs some summary tokens are out-of-vocabulary words and occurs in input document, we incorporate copy mechanism BIBREF6 based on the Transformer decoder, we will describe it briefly.\nAt decoder time step $t$ , we first calculate the attention probability distribution over source document $X$ using the bi-linear dot product of the last layer decoder output of Transformer $o_t$ and the encoder output $h_j$ , as Eq. ( 15 ) () shows.\n$$u_t^j =& o_t W_c h_j \\\\ \\alpha _t^j =& \\cfrac{\\exp {u_t^j}}{\\sum _{k=1}^N\\exp {u_t^k}} $$   (Eq. 15)\nWe then calculate copying gate $g_t\\in [0, 1]$ , which makes a soft choice between selecting from source and generating from vocabulary, $W_c, W_g, b_g$ are parameters:\n$$g_t = sigmoid(W_g \\cdot [o_t, h] + b_g) $$   (Eq. 16)\nUsing $g_t$ we calculate the weighted sum of copy probability and generation probability to get the final predicted probability of extended vocabulary $\\mathcal {V} + \\mathcal {X}$ , where $\\mathcal {X}$ is the set of out of vocabulary words from the source document. The final probability is calculated as follow:\n$$P_t(w) = (1-g_t)P_t^{vocab}(w) + g_t\\sum _{i:w_i=w} \\alpha _t^i$$   (Eq. 17)\nSummary Refine Process\nThe main reason to introduce the refine process is to enhance the decoder using BERT's contextualized representations, so we do not modify the encoder and reuse it during this process.\nOn the decoder side, we propose a new word-level refine decoder. The refine decoder receives a generated summary draft as input, and outputs a refined summary. It first masks each word in the summary draft one by one, then feeds the draft to BERT to generate context vectors. Finally it predicts a refined summary word using an $N$ layer Transformer decoder which is the same as the draft decoder. At t-th time step the n-th word of input summary is masked, and the decoder predicts the n-th refined word given other words of the summary.\nThe learning objective of this process is shown in Eq. ( 19 ), $y_i$ is the i-th summary word and $y_{i}^*$ for the ground-truth summary word, and $a_{\\ne i} = \\lbrace a_1, \\ldots , a_{i-1}, a_{i+1}, \\ldots , a_{|y|}\\rbrace $ .\n$$L_{refine} = \\sum _{i=1}^{|y|} -\\log P(y_i = y_i^*|a_{\\ne i}, H) $$   (Eq. 19)\nFrom the view of BERT or other contextualized embeddings, the refine decoding process provides a more complete input sequence which is consistent with their pre-training processes. Intuitively, this process works as follows: first the draft decoder writes a summary draft based on a document, and then the refine decoder edits the draft. It concentrates on one word at a time, based on the source document as well as other words.\nWe design the word-level refine decoder because this process is similar to the cloze task in BERT's pre-train process, therefore by using the ability of the contextual language model the decoder can generate more fluent and natural sequences.\nThe parameters are shared between the draft decoder and refine decoder, as we find that using individual parameters the model's performance degrades a lot. The reason may be that we use teach-forcing during training, and thus the word-level refine decoder learns to predict words given all the other ground-truth words of summary. This objective is similar to the language model's pre-train objective, and is probably not enough for the decoder to learn to generate refined summaries. So in our model all decoders share the same parameters.\nResearchers usually use ROUGE as the evaluation metric for summarization, however during sequence-to-sequence model training, the objective is to maximize the log likelihood of generated sequences. This mis-match harms the model's performance, so we add a discrete objective to the model, and optimize it by introducing the policy gradient method. For example, the discrete objective for the summary draft process is as Eq. ( 21 ) shows, where $a^s$ is the draft summary sampled from predicted distribution, and $R(a^s)$ is the reward score compared with the ground-truth summary, we use ROUGE-L in our experiment. To balance between optimizing the discrete objective and generating readable sequences, we mix the discrete objective with maximum-likelihood objective. As Eq. () shows, minimizing $\\hat{L}_{dec}$ is the final objective for the draft process, note here $L_{dec}$ is $-logP(a|x)$ . In the refine process we introduce similar objectives.\n$$L^{rl}_{dec} = R(a^s)\\cdot [-\\log (P(a^s|x))]  \\\\ \\hat{L}_{dec} = \\gamma * L^{rl}_{dec} + (1 - \\gamma ) * L_{dec} $$   (Eq. 21)\nLearning and Inference\nDuring model training, the objective of our model is sum of the two processes, jointly trained using \"teacher-forcing\" algorithm. During training we feed the ground-truth summary to each decoder and minimize the objective.\n$$L_{model} = \\hat{L}_{dec} + \\hat{L}_{refine}$$   (Eq. 23)\nAt test time, each time step we choose the predicted word by $\\hat{y} = argmax_{y^{\\prime }} P(y^{\\prime }|x)$ , use beam search to generate the draft summaries, and use greedy search to generate the refined summaries.\nSettings\nIn this work, all of our models are built on $BERT_{BASE}$ , although another larger pre-trained model with better performance ( $BERT_{LARGE}$ ) has published but it costs too much time and GPU memory. We use WordPiece embeddings with a 30,000 vocabulary which is the same as BERT. We set the layer of transformer decoders to 12(8 on NYT50), and set the attention heads number to 12(8 on NYT50), set fully-connected sub-layer hidden size to 3072. We train the model using an Adam optimizer with learning rate of $3e-4$ , $\\beta _1=0.9$ , $\\beta _2=0.999$ and $\\epsilon =10^{-9}$ and use a dynamic learning rate during the training process. For regularization, we use dropout BIBREF13 and label smoothing BIBREF14 in our models and set the dropout rate to 0.15, and the label smoothing value to 0.1. We set the RL objective factor $\\gamma $ to 0.99.\nDuring training, we set the batch size to 36, and train for 4 epochs(8 epochs for NYT50 since it has many fewer training samples), after training the best model are selected from last 10 models based on development set performance. Due to GPU memory limit, we use gradient accumulation, set accumulate step to 12 and feed 3 samples at each step. We use beam size 4 and length penalty of 1.0 to generate logical form sequences.\nWe filter repeated tri-grams in beam-search process by setting word probability to zero if it will generate an tri-gram which exists in the existing summary. It is a nice method to avoid phrase repetition since the two datasets seldom contains repeated tri-grams in one summary. We also fine tune the generated sequences using another two simple rules. When there are multi summary sentences with exactly the same content, we keep the first one and remove the other sentences; we also remove sentences with less than 3 words from the result.\nTo evaluate the performance of our model, we conduct experiments on CNN/Daily Mail dataset, which is a large collection of news articles and modified for summarization. Following BIBREF0 we choose the non-anonymized version of the dataset, which consists of more than 280,000 training samples and 11490 test set samples.\nWe also conduct experiments on the New York Times(NYT) dataset which also consists of many news articles. The original dataset can be applied here. In our experiment, we follow the dataset splits and other pre-process settings of BIBREF15 . We first filter all samples without a full article text or abstract and then remove all samples with summaries shorter than 50 words. Then we choose the test set based on the date of publication(all examples published after January 1, 2007). The final dataset contains 22,000 training samples and 3,452 test samples and is called NYT50 since all summaries are longer than 50 words.\nWe tokenize all sequences of the two datasets using the WordPiece tokenizer. After tokenizing, the average article length and summary length of CNN/Daily Mail are 691 and 51, and NYT50's average article length and summary length are 1152 and 75. We truncate the article length to 512, and the summary length to 100 in our experiment(max summary length is set to 150 on NYT50 as its average golden summary length is longer).\nOn CNN/Daily Mail dataset, we report the full-length F-1 score of the ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2 and ROUGE-L metrics, calculated using PyRouge package and the Porter stemmer option. On NYT50, following BIBREF4 we evaluate limited length ROUGE recall score(limit the generated summary length to the ground truth length). We split NYT50 summaries into sentences by semicolons to calculate the ROUGE scores.\nResults and Analysis\nTable 1 shows the results on CNN/Daily Mail dataset, we compare the performance of many recent approaches with our model. We classify them to two groups based on whether they are extractive or abstractive models. As the last line of the table shows, the ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-2 score of our full model is comparable with DCA, and outperforms on ROUGE-L. Also, compared to extractive models NeuSUM and MASK- $LM^{global}$ , we achieve slight higher ROUGE-1. Except the four scores, our model outperforms these models on all the other scores, and since we have 95% confidence interval of at most $\\pm $ 0.20, these improvements are statistically significant.\nAs the last four lines of Table 1 show, we conduct an ablation study on our model variants to analyze the importance of each component. We use three ablation models for the experiments. One-Stage: A sequence-to-sequence model with copy mechanism based on BERT; Two-Stage: Adding the word-refine decoder to the One-Stage model; Two-Stage + RL: Full model with refine process cooperated with RL objective.\nFirst, we compare the Two-Stage+RL model with Two-Stage ablation, we observe that the full model outperforms by 0.30 on average ROUGE, suggesting that the reinforcement objective helps the model effectively. Then we analyze the effect of refine process by removing word-level refine from the Two-Stage model, we observe that without the refine process the average ROUGE score drops by 1.69. The ablation study shows that each module is necessary for our full model, and the improvements are statistically significant on all metrics.\nTo evaluate the impact of summary length on model performance, we compare the average rouge score improvements of our model with different length of ground-truth summaries. As the above sub-figure of Figure 2 shows, compared to Pointer-Generator with Coverage, on length interval 40-80(occupies about 70% of test set) the improvements of our model are higher than shorter samples, confirms that with better context representations, in longer documents our model can achieve higher performance.\nAs the below sub-figure of Figure 2 shows, compared to extractive baseline: Lead-3 BIBREF0 , the advantage of our model will fall when golden summary length is greater than 80. This probably because that we truncate the long documents and golden summaries and cannot get full information, it could also because that the training data in these intervals is too few to train an abstractive model, so simple extractive method will not fall too far behind.\nAdditional Results on NYT50\nTable 2 shows experiments on the NYT50 corpus. Since the short summary samples are filtered, NYT50 has average longer summaries than CNN/Daily Mail. So the model needs to catch long-term dependency of the sequences to generate good summaries.\nThe first two lines of Table 2 show results of the two baselines introduced by BIBREF15 : these baselines select first n sentences, or select the first k words from the original document. Also we compare performance of our model with two recent models, we see 2.39 ROUGE-1 improvements compared to the ML+RL with intra-attn approach(previous SOTA) carries over to this dataset, which is a large margin. On ROUGE-2, our model also get an improvement of 0.51. The experiment proves that our approach can outperform competitive methods on different data distributions.\nPre-trained language models\nPre-trained word vectors BIBREF17 , BIBREF18 , BIBREF19 have been widely used in many NLP tasks. More recently, pre-trained language models (ELMo, GPT and BERT), have also achieved great success on several NLP problems such as textual entailment, semantic similarity, reading comprehension, and question answering BIBREF20 , BIBREF21 , BIBREF22 .\nSome recent works also focus on leveraging pre-trained language models in summarization. BIBREF23 pretrain a language model and use it as the sentiment analyser when generating reviews of goods. BIBREF24 train a language model on golden summaries, and then use it on the decoder side to incorporate prior knowledge.\nIn this work, we use BERT(which is a pre-trained language model using large scale unlabeled data) on the encoder and decoder of a seq2seq model, and by designing a two stage decoding structure we build a competitive model for abstractive text summarization.\nConclusion and Future Work\nIn this work, we propose a two-stage model based on sequence-to-sequence paradigm. Our model utilize BERT on both encoder and decoder sides, and introduce reinforce objective in learning process. We evaluate our model on two benchmark datasets CNN/Daily Mail and New York Times, the experimental results show that compared to previous systems our approach effectively improves performance.\nAlthough our experiments are conducted on summarization task, our model can be used in most natural language generation tasks, such as machine translation, question generation and paraphrasing. The refine decoder and mixed objective can also be applied on other sequence generation tasks, and we will investigate on them in future work.", "answers": ["Unanswerable"], "length": 3885, "dataset": "qasper_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "b0bc5483c009536bf3dcf582b3b2015d4db13aaf81df8c9a", "pred": " Unanswerable.

Do not provide any explanation.\n\nArticle: Introduction\nThe task of generating natural language descriptions of structured data (such as tables) BIBREF2 , BIBREF3 , BIBREF4 has seen a growth in interest with the rise of sequence to sequence models that provide an easy way of encoding tables and generating text from them BIBREF0 , BIBREF1 , BIBREF5 , BIBREF6 .\nFor text generation tasks, the only gold standard metric is to show the output to humans for judging its quality, but this is too expensive to apply repeatedly anytime small modifications are made to a system. Hence, automatic metrics that compare the generated text to one or more reference texts are routinely used to compare models BIBREF7 . For table-to-text generation, automatic evaluation has largely relied on BLEU BIBREF8 and ROUGE BIBREF9 . The underlying assumption behind these metrics is that the reference text is gold-standard, i.e., it is the ideal target text that a system should generate. In practice, however, when datasets are collected automatically and heuristically, the reference texts are often not ideal. Figure FIGREF2 shows an example from the WikiBio dataset BIBREF0 . Here the reference contains extra information which no system can be expected to produce given only the associated table. We call such reference texts divergent from the table.\nWe show that existing automatic metrics, including BLEU, correlate poorly with human judgments when the evaluation sets contain divergent references (\u00a7 SECREF36 ). For many table-to-text generation tasks, the tables themselves are in a pseudo-natural language format (e.g., WikiBio, WebNLG BIBREF6 , and E2E-NLG BIBREF10 ). In such cases we propose to compare the generated text to the underlying table as well to improve evaluation. We develop a new metric, PARENT (Precision And Recall of Entailed N-grams from the Table) (\u00a7 SECREF3 ). When computing precision, PARENT effectively uses a union of the reference and the table, to reward correct information missing from the reference. When computing recall, it uses an intersection of the reference and the table, to ignore extra incorrect information in the reference. The union and intersection are computed with the help of an entailment model to decide if a text n-gram is entailed by the table. We show that this method is more effective than using the table as an additional reference. Our main contributions are:\nTable-to-Text Generation\nWe briefly review the task of generating natural language descriptions of semi-structured data, which we refer to as tables henceforth BIBREF11 , BIBREF12 . Tables can be expressed as set of records INLINEFORM0 , where each record is a tuple (entity, attribute, value). When all the records are about the same entity, we can truncate the records to (attribute, value) pairs. For example, for the table in Figure FIGREF2 , the records are {(Birth Name, Michael Dahlquist), (Born, December 22 1965), ...}. The task is to generate a text INLINEFORM1 which summarizes the records in a fluent and grammatical manner. For training and evaluation we further assume that we have a reference description INLINEFORM2 available for each table. We let INLINEFORM3 denote an evaluation set of tables, references and texts generated from a model INLINEFORM4 , and INLINEFORM5 , INLINEFORM6 denote the collection of n-grams of order INLINEFORM7 in INLINEFORM8 and INLINEFORM9 , respectively. We use INLINEFORM10 to denote the count of n-gram INLINEFORM11 in INLINEFORM12 , and INLINEFORM13 to denote the minimum of its counts in INLINEFORM14 and INLINEFORM15 . Our goal is to assign a score to the model, which correlates highly with human judgments of the quality of that model.\nPARENT\nPARENT evaluates each instance INLINEFORM0 separately, by computing the precision and recall of INLINEFORM1 against both INLINEFORM2 and INLINEFORM3 .\nEvaluation via Information Extraction\nBIBREF1 proposed to use an auxiliary model, trained to extract structured records from text, for evaluation. However, the extraction model presented in that work is limited to the closed-domain setting of basketball game tables and summaries. In particular, they assume that each table has exactly the same set of attributes for each entity, and that the entities can be identified in the text via string matching. These assumptions are not valid for the open-domain WikiBio dataset, and hence we train our own extraction model to replicate their evaluation scheme.\nOur extraction system is a pointer-generator network BIBREF19 , which learns to produce a linearized version of the table from the text. The network learns which attributes need to be populated in the output table, along with their values. It is trained on the training set of WikiBio. At test time we parsed the output strings into a set of (attribute, value) tuples and compare it to the ground truth table. The F-score of this text-to-table system was INLINEFORM0 , which is comparable to other challenging open-domain settings BIBREF20 . More details are included in the Appendix SECREF52 .\nGiven this information extraction system, we consider the following metrics for evaluation, along the lines of BIBREF1 . Content Selection (CS): F-score for the (attribute, value) pairs extracted from the generated text compared to those extracted from the reference. Relation Generation (RG): Precision for the (attribute, value) pairs extracted from the generated text compared to those in the ground truth table. RG-F: Since our task emphasizes the recall of information from the table as well, we consider another variant which computes the F-score of the extracted pairs to those in the table. We omit the content ordering metric, since our extraction system does not align records to the input text.\nExperiments & Results\nIn this section we compare several automatic evaluation metrics by checking their correlation with the scores assigned by humans to table-to-text models. Specifically, given INLINEFORM0 models INLINEFORM1 , and their outputs on an evaluation set, we show these generated texts to humans to judge their quality, and obtain aggregated human evaluation scores for all the models, INLINEFORM2 (\u00a7 SECREF33 ). Next, to evaluate an automatic metric, we compute the scores it assigns to each model, INLINEFORM3 , and check the Pearson correlation between INLINEFORM4 and INLINEFORM5 BIBREF21 .\nData & Models\nOur main experiments are on the WikiBio dataset BIBREF0 , which is automatically constructed and contains many divergent references. In \u00a7 SECREF47 we also present results on the data released as part of the WebNLG challenge.\nWe developed several models of varying quality for generating text from the tables in WikiBio. This gives us a diverse set of outputs to evaluate the automatic metrics on. Table TABREF32 lists the models along with their hyperparameter settings and their scores from the human evaluation (\u00a7 SECREF33 ). Our focus is primarily on neural sequence-to-sequence methods since these are most widely used, but we also include a template-based baseline. All neural models were trained on the WikiBio training set. Training details and sample outputs are included in Appendices SECREF56 & SECREF57 .\nWe divide these models into two categories and measure correlation separately for both the categories. The first category, WikiBio-Systems, includes one model each from the four families listed in Table TABREF32 . This category tests whether a metric can be used to compare different model families with a large variation in the quality of their outputs. The second category, WikiBio-Hyperparams, includes 13 different hyperparameter settings of PG-Net BIBREF19 , which was the best performing system overall. 9 of these were obtained by varying the beam size and length normalization penalty of the decoder network BIBREF23 , and the remaining 4 were obtained by re-scoring beams of size 8 with the information extraction model described in \u00a7 SECREF4 . All the models in this category produce high quality fluent texts, and differ primarily on the quantity and accuracy of the information they express. Here we are testing whether a metric can be used to compare similar systems with a small variation in performance. This is an important use-case as metrics are often used to tune hyperparameters of a model.\nHuman Evaluation\nWe collected human judgments on the quality of the 16 models trained for WikiBio, plus the reference texts. Workers on a crowd-sourcing platform, proficient in English, were shown a table with pairs of generated texts, or a generated text and the reference, and asked to select the one they prefer. Figure FIGREF34 shows the instructions they were given. Paired comparisons have been shown to be superior to rating scales for comparing generated texts BIBREF24 . However, for measuring correlation the comparisons need to be aggregated into real-valued scores, INLINEFORM0 , for each of the INLINEFORM1 models. For this, we use Thurstone's method BIBREF22 , which assigns a score to each model based on how many times it was preferred over an alternative.\nThe data collection was performed separately for models in the WikiBio-Systems and WikiBio-Hyperparams categories. 1100 tables were sampled from the development set, and for each table we got 8 different sentence pairs annotated across the two categories, resulting in a total of 8800 pairwise comparisons. Each pair was judged by one worker only which means there may be noise at the instance-level, but the aggregated system-level scores had low variance (cf. Table TABREF32 ). In total around 500 different workers were involved in the annotation. References were also included in the evaluation, and they received a lower score than PG-Net, highlighting the divergence in WikiBio.\nCompared Metrics\nText only: We compare BLEU BIBREF8 , ROUGE BIBREF9 , METEOR BIBREF18 , CIDEr and CIDEr-D BIBREF25 using their publicly available implementations.\nInformation Extraction based: We compare the CS, RG and RG-F metrics discussed in \u00a7 SECREF4 .\nText & Table: We compare a variant of BLEU, denoted as BLEU-T, where the values from the table are used as additional references. BLEU-T draws inspiration from iBLEU BIBREF26 but instead rewards n-grams which match the table rather than penalizing them. For PARENT, we compare both the word-overlap model (PARENT-W) and the co-occurrence model (PARENT-C) for determining entailment. We also compare versions where a single INLINEFORM0 is tuned on the entire dataset to maximize correlation with human judgments, denoted as PARENT*-W/C.\nCorrelation Comparison\nWe use bootstrap sampling (500 iterations) over the 1100 tables for which we collected human annotations to get an idea of how the correlation of each metric varies with the underlying data. In each iteration, we sample with replacement, tables along with their references and all the generated texts for that table. Then we compute aggregated human evaluation and metric scores for each of the models and compute the correlation between the two. We report the average correlation across all bootstrap samples for each metric in Table TABREF37 . The distribution of correlations for the best performing metrics are shown in Figure FIGREF38 .\nTable TABREF37 also indicates whether PARENT is significantly better than a baseline metric. BIBREF21 suggest using the William's test for this purpose, but since we are computing correlations between only 4/13 systems at a time, this test has very weak power in our case. Hence, we use the bootstrap samples to obtain a INLINEFORM0 confidence interval of the difference in correlation between PARENT and any other metric and check whether this is above 0 BIBREF27 .\nCorrelations are higher for the systems category than the hyperparams category. The latter is a more difficult setting since very similar models are compared, and hence the variance of the correlations is also high. Commonly used metrics which only rely on the reference (BLEU, ROUGE, METEOR, CIDEr) have only weak correlations with human judgments. In the hyperparams category, these are often negative, implying that tuning models based on these may lead to selecting worse models. BLEU performs the best among these, and adding n-grams from the table as references improves this further (BLEU-T).\nAmong the extractive evaluation metrics, CS, which also only relies on the reference, has poor correlation in the hyperparams category. RG-F, and both variants of the PARENT metric achieve the highest correlation for both settings. There is no significant difference among these for the hyperparams category, but for systems, PARENT-W is significantly better than the other two. While RG-F needs a full information extraction pipeline in its implementation, PARENT-C only relies on co-occurrence counts, and PARENT-W can be used out-of-the-box for any dataset. To our knowledge, this is the first rigorous evaluation of using information extraction for generation evaluation.\nOn this dataset, the word-overlap model showed higher correlation than the co-occurrence model for entailment. In \u00a7 SECREF47 we will show that for the WebNLG dataset, where more paraphrasing is involved between the table and text, the opposite is true. Lastly, we note that the heuristic for selecting INLINEFORM0 is sufficient to produce high correlations for PARENT, however, if human annotations are available, this can be tuned to produce significantly higher correlations (PARENT*-W/C).\nAnalysis\nIn this section we further analyze the performance of PARENT-W under different conditions, and compare to the other best metrics from Table TABREF37 .\nTo study the correlation as we vary the number of divergent references, we also collected binary labels from workers for whether a reference is entailed by the corresponding table. We define a reference as entailed when it mentions only information which can be inferred from the table. Each table and reference pair was judged by 3 independent workers, and we used the majority vote as the label for that pair. Overall, only INLINEFORM0 of the references were labeled as entailed by the table. Fleiss' INLINEFORM1 was INLINEFORM2 , which indicates a fair agreement. We found the workers sometimes disagreed on what information can be reasonably entailed by the table.\nFigure FIGREF40 shows the correlations as we vary the percent of entailed examples in the evaluation set of WikiBio. Each point is obtained by fixing the desired proportion of entailed examples, and sampling subsets from the full set which satisfy this proportion. PARENT and RG-F remain stable and show a high correlation across the entire range, whereas BLEU and BLEU-T vary a lot. In the hyperparams category, the latter two have the worst correlation when the evaluation set contains only entailed examples, which may seem surprising. However, on closer examination we found that this subset tends to omit a lot of information from the tables. Systems which produce more information than these references are penalized by BLEU, but not in the human evaluation. PARENT overcomes this issue by measuring recall against the table in addition to the reference.\nWe check how different components in the computation of PARENT contribute to its correlation to human judgments. Specifically, we remove the probability INLINEFORM0 of an n-gram INLINEFORM1 being entailed by the table from Eqs. EQREF19 and EQREF23 . The average correlation for PARENT-W drops to INLINEFORM5 in this case. We also try a variant of PARENT with INLINEFORM6 , which removes the contribution of Table Recall (Eq. EQREF22 ). The average correlation is INLINEFORM7 in this case. With these components, the correlation is INLINEFORM8 , showing that they are crucial to the performance of PARENT.\nBIBREF28 point out that hill-climbing on an automatic metric is meaningless if that metric has a low instance-level correlation to human judgments. In Table TABREF46 we show the average accuracy of the metrics in making the same judgments as humans between pairs of generated texts. Both variants of PARENT are significantly better than the other metrics, however the best accuracy is only INLINEFORM0 for the binary task. This is a challenging task, since there are typically only subtle differences between the texts. Achieving higher instance-level accuracies will require more sophisticated language understanding models for evaluation.\nWebNLG Dataset\nTo check how PARENT correlates with human judgments when the references are elicited from humans (and less likely to be divergent), we check its correlation with the human ratings provided for the systems competing in the WebNLG challenge BIBREF6 . The task is to generate text describing 1-5 RDF triples (e.g. John E Blaha, birthPlace, San Antonio), and human ratings were collected for the outputs of 9 participating systems on 223 instances. These systems include a mix of pipelined, statistical and neural methods. Each instance has upto 3 reference texts associated with the RDF triples, which we use for evaluation.\nThe human ratings were collected on 3 distinct aspects \u2013 grammaticality, fluency and semantics, where semantics corresponds to the degree to which a generated text agrees with the meaning of the underlying RDF triples. We report the correlation of several metrics with these ratings in Table TABREF48 . Both variants of PARENT are either competitive or better than the other metrics in terms of the average correlation to all three aspects. This shows that PARENT is applicable for high quality references as well.\nWhile BLEU has the highest correlation for the grammar and fluency aspects, PARENT does best for semantics. This suggests that the inclusion of source tables into the evaluation orients the metric more towards measuring the fidelity of the content of the generation. A similar trend is seen comparing BLEU and BLEU-T. As modern neural text generation systems are typically very fluent, measuring their fidelity is of increasing importance. Between the two entailment models, PARENT-C is better due to its higher correlation with the grammaticality and fluency aspects.\nThe INLINEFORM0 parameter in the calculation of PARENT decides whether to compute recall against the table or the reference (Eq. EQREF22 ). Figure FIGREF50 shows the distribution of the values taken by INLINEFORM1 using the heuristic described in \u00a7 SECREF3 for instances in both WikiBio and WebNLG. For WikiBio, the recall of the references against the table is generally low, and hence the recall of the generated text relies more on the table. For WebNLG, where the references are elicited from humans, this recall is much higher (often INLINEFORM2 ), and hence the recall of the generated text relies more on the reference.\nRelated Work\nOver the years several studies have evaluated automatic metrics for measuring text generation performance BIBREF29 , BIBREF30 , BIBREF31 , BIBREF32 , BIBREF33 , BIBREF34 , BIBREF35 . The only consensus from these studies seems to be that no single metric is suitable across all tasks. A recurring theme is that metrics like BLEU and NIST BIBREF36 are not suitable for judging content quality in NLG. Recently, BIBREF37 did a comprehensive study of several metrics on the outputs of state-of-the-art NLG systems, and found that while they showed acceptable correlation with human judgments at the system level, they failed to show any correlation at the sentence level. Ours is the first study which checks the quality of metrics when table-to-text references are divergent. We show that in this case even system level correlations can be unreliable.\nHallucination BIBREF38 , BIBREF39 refers to when an NLG system generates text which mentions extra information than what is present in the source from which it is generated. Divergence can be viewed as hallucination in the reference text itself. PARENT deals with hallucination by discounting n-grams which do not overlap with either the reference or the table.\nPARENT draws inspiration from iBLEU BIBREF26 , a metric for evaluating paraphrase generation, which compares the generated text to both the source text and the reference. While iBLEU penalizes texts which match the source, here we reward such texts since our task values accuracy of generated text more than the need for paraphrasing the tabular content BIBREF40 . Similar to SARI for text simplification BIBREF41 and Q-BLEU for question generation BIBREF42 , PARENT falls under the category of task-specific metrics.\nConclusions\nWe study the automatic evaluation of table-to-text systems when the references diverge from the table. We propose a new metric, PARENT, which shows the highest correlation with humans across a range of settings with divergent references in WikiBio. We also perform the first empirical evaluation of information extraction based metrics BIBREF1 , and find RG-F to be effective. Lastly, we show that PARENT is comparable to the best existing metrics when references are elicited by humans on the WebNLG data.\nAcknowledgements\nBhuwan Dhingra is supported by a fellowship from Siemens, and by grants from Google.

We also thank the anonymous reviewers for their feedback.\nInformation Extraction System\nFor evaluation via information extraction BIBREF1 we train a model for WikiBio which accepts text as input and generates a table as the output. Tables in WikiBio are open-domain, without any fixed schema for which attributes may be present or absent in an instance. Hence we employ the Pointer-Generator Network (PG-Net) BIBREF19 for this purpose. Specifically, we use a sequence-to-sequence model, whose encoder and decoder are both single-layer bi-directional LSTMs. The decoder is augmented with an attention mechanism over the states of the encoder. Further, it also uses a copy mechanism to optionally copy tokens directly from the source text. We do not use the coverage mechanism of BIBREF19 since that is specific to the task of summarization they study. The decoder is trained to produce a linearized version of the table where the rows and columns are flattened into a sequence, and separate by special tokens. Figure FIGREF53 shows an example.\nClearly, since the references are divergent, the model cannot be expected to produce the entire table, and we see some false information being hallucinated after training. Nevertheless, as we show in \u00a7 SECREF36 , this system can be used for evaluating generated texts. After training, we can parse the output sequence along the special tokens INLINEFORM0 R INLINEFORM1 and INLINEFORM2 C INLINEFORM3 to get a set of (attribute, value) pairs. Table TABREF54 shows the precision, recall and F-score of these extracted pairs against the ground truth tables, where the attributes and values are compared using an exact string match.\nHyperparameters\nAfter tuning we found the same set of hyperparameters to work well for both the table-to-text PG-Net, and the inverse information extraction PG-Net. The hidden state size of the biLSTMs was set to 200. The input and output vocabularies were set to 50000 most common words in the corpus, with additional special symbols for table attribute names (such as \u201cbirth-date\u201d). The embeddings of the tokens in the vocabulary were initialized with Glove BIBREF43 . Learning rate of INLINEFORM0 was used during training, with the Adam optimizer, and a dropout of INLINEFORM1 was also applied to the outputs of the biLSTM. Models were trained till the loss on the dev set stopped dropping. Maximum length of a decoded text was set to 40 tokens, and that of the tables was set to 120 tokens. Various beam sizes and length normalization penalties were applied for the table-to-text system, which are listed in the main paper. For the information extraction system, we found a beam size of 8 and no length penalty to produce the highest F-score on the dev set.\nSample Outputs\nTable TABREF55 shows some sample references and the corresponding predictions from the best performing model, PG-Net for WikiBio.\n\n Answer the question based on the above article as concisely as you can, using a single phrase or sentence if possible.

Do not provide any explanation.\n\nQuestion: How many people participated in their evaluation study of table-to-text models?\n\nAnswer:", "input": "How many people participated in their evaluation study of table-to-text models?", "context": "Introduction\nThe task of generating natural language descriptions of structured data (such as tables) BIBREF2 , BIBREF3 , BIBREF4 has seen a growth in interest with the rise of sequence to sequence models that provide an easy way of encoding tables and generating text from them BIBREF0 , BIBREF1 , BIBREF5 , BIBREF6 .\nFor text generation tasks, the only gold standard metric is to show the output to humans for judging its quality, but this is too expensive to apply repeatedly anytime small modifications are made to a system. Hence, automatic metrics that compare the generated text to one or more reference texts are routinely used to compare models BIBREF7 . For table-to-text generation, automatic evaluation has largely relied on BLEU BIBREF8 and ROUGE BIBREF9 . The underlying assumption behind these metrics is that the reference text is gold-standard, i.e., it is the ideal target text that a system should generate. In practice, however, when datasets are collected automatically and heuristically, the reference texts are often not ideal. Figure FIGREF2 shows an example from the WikiBio dataset BIBREF0 . Here the reference contains extra information which no system can be expected to produce given only the associated table. We call such reference texts divergent from the table.\nWe show that existing automatic metrics, including BLEU, correlate poorly with human judgments when the evaluation sets contain divergent references (\u00a7 SECREF36 ). For many table-to-text generation tasks, the tables themselves are in a pseudo-natural language format (e.g., WikiBio, WebNLG BIBREF6 , and E2E-NLG BIBREF10 ). In such cases we propose to compare the generated text to the underlying table as well to improve evaluation. We develop a new metric, PARENT (Precision And Recall of Entailed N-grams from the Table) (\u00a7 SECREF3 ). When computing precision, PARENT effectively uses a union of the reference and the table, to reward correct information missing from the reference. When computing recall, it uses an intersection of the reference and the table, to ignore extra incorrect information in the reference. The union and intersection are computed with the help of an entailment model to decide if a text n-gram is entailed by the table. We show that this method is more effective than using the table as an additional reference. Our main contributions are:\nTable-to-Text Generation\nWe briefly review the task of generating natural language descriptions of semi-structured data, which we refer to as tables henceforth BIBREF11 , BIBREF12 . Tables can be expressed as set of records INLINEFORM0 , where each record is a tuple (entity, attribute, value). When all the records are about the same entity, we can truncate the records to (attribute, value) pairs. For example, for the table in Figure FIGREF2 , the records are {(Birth Name, Michael Dahlquist), (Born, December 22 1965), ...}. The task is to generate a text INLINEFORM1 which summarizes the records in a fluent and grammatical manner. For training and evaluation we further assume that we have a reference description INLINEFORM2 available for each table. We let INLINEFORM3 denote an evaluation set of tables, references and texts generated from a model INLINEFORM4 , and INLINEFORM5 , INLINEFORM6 denote the collection of n-grams of order INLINEFORM7 in INLINEFORM8 and INLINEFORM9 , respectively. We use INLINEFORM10 to denote the count of n-gram INLINEFORM11 in INLINEFORM12 , and INLINEFORM13 to denote the minimum of its counts in INLINEFORM14 and INLINEFORM15 . Our goal is to assign a score to the model, which correlates highly with human judgments of the quality of that model.\nPARENT\nPARENT evaluates each instance INLINEFORM0 separately, by computing the precision and recall of INLINEFORM1 against both INLINEFORM2 and INLINEFORM3 .\nEvaluation via Information Extraction\nBIBREF1 proposed to use an auxiliary model, trained to extract structured records from text, for evaluation. However, the extraction model presented in that work is limited to the closed-domain setting of basketball game tables and summaries. In particular, they assume that each table has exactly the same set of attributes for each entity, and that the entities can be identified in the text via string matching. These assumptions are not valid for the open-domain WikiBio dataset, and hence we train our own extraction model to replicate their evaluation scheme.\nOur extraction system is a pointer-generator network BIBREF19 , which learns to produce a linearized version of the table from the text. The network learns which attributes need to be populated in the output table, along with their values. It is trained on the training set of WikiBio. At test time we parsed the output strings into a set of (attribute, value) tuples and compare it to the ground truth table. The F-score of this text-to-table system was INLINEFORM0 , which is comparable to other challenging open-domain settings BIBREF20 . More details are included in the Appendix SECREF52 .\nGiven this information extraction system, we consider the following metrics for evaluation, along the lines of BIBREF1 . Content Selection (CS): F-score for the (attribute, value) pairs extracted from the generated text compared to those extracted from the reference. Relation Generation (RG): Precision for the (attribute, value) pairs extracted from the generated text compared to those in the ground truth table. RG-F: Since our task emphasizes the recall of information from the table as well, we consider another variant which computes the F-score of the extracted pairs to those in the table. We omit the content ordering metric, since our extraction system does not align records to the input text.\nExperiments & Results\nIn this section we compare several automatic evaluation metrics by checking their correlation with the scores assigned by humans to table-to-text models. Specifically, given INLINEFORM0 models INLINEFORM1 , and their outputs on an evaluation set, we show these generated texts to humans to judge their quality, and obtain aggregated human evaluation scores for all the models, INLINEFORM2 (\u00a7 SECREF33 ). Next, to evaluate an automatic metric, we compute the scores it assigns to each model, INLINEFORM3 , and check the Pearson correlation between INLINEFORM4 and INLINEFORM5 BIBREF21 .\nData & Models\nOur main experiments are on the WikiBio dataset BIBREF0 , which is automatically constructed and contains many divergent references. In \u00a7 SECREF47 we also present results on the data released as part of the WebNLG challenge.\nWe developed several models of varying quality for generating text from the tables in WikiBio. This gives us a diverse set of outputs to evaluate the automatic metrics on. Table TABREF32 lists the models along with their hyperparameter settings and their scores from the human evaluation (\u00a7 SECREF33 ). Our focus is primarily on neural sequence-to-sequence methods since these are most widely used, but we also include a template-based baseline. All neural models were trained on the WikiBio training set. Training details and sample outputs are included in Appendices SECREF56 & SECREF57 .\nWe divide these models into two categories and measure correlation separately for both the categories. The first category, WikiBio-Systems, includes one model each from the four families listed in Table TABREF32 . This category tests whether a metric can be used to compare different model families with a large variation in the quality of their outputs. The second category, WikiBio-Hyperparams, includes 13 different hyperparameter settings of PG-Net BIBREF19 , which was the best performing system overall. 9 of these were obtained by varying the beam size and length normalization penalty of the decoder network BIBREF23 , and the remaining 4 were obtained by re-scoring beams of size 8 with the information extraction model described in \u00a7 SECREF4 . All the models in this category produce high quality fluent texts, and differ primarily on the quantity and accuracy of the information they express. Here we are testing whether a metric can be used to compare similar systems with a small variation in performance. This is an important use-case as metrics are often used to tune hyperparameters of a model.\nHuman Evaluation\nWe collected human judgments on the quality of the 16 models trained for WikiBio, plus the reference texts. Workers on a crowd-sourcing platform, proficient in English, were shown a table with pairs of generated texts, or a generated text and the reference, and asked to select the one they prefer. Figure FIGREF34 shows the instructions they were given. Paired comparisons have been shown to be superior to rating scales for comparing generated texts BIBREF24 . However, for measuring correlation the comparisons need to be aggregated into real-valued scores, INLINEFORM0 , for each of the INLINEFORM1 models. For this, we use Thurstone's method BIBREF22 , which assigns a score to each model based on how many times it was preferred over an alternative.\nThe data collection was performed separately for models in the WikiBio-Systems and WikiBio-Hyperparams categories. 1100 tables were sampled from the development set, and for each table we got 8 different sentence pairs annotated across the two categories, resulting in a total of 8800 pairwise comparisons. Each pair was judged by one worker only which means there may be noise at the instance-level, but the aggregated system-level scores had low variance (cf. Table TABREF32 ). In total around 500 different workers were involved in the annotation. References were also included in the evaluation, and they received a lower score than PG-Net, highlighting the divergence in WikiBio.\nCompared Metrics\nText only: We compare BLEU BIBREF8 , ROUGE BIBREF9 , METEOR BIBREF18 , CIDEr and CIDEr-D BIBREF25 using their publicly available implementations.\nInformation Extraction based: We compare the CS, RG and RG-F metrics discussed in \u00a7 SECREF4 .\nText & Table: We compare a variant of BLEU, denoted as BLEU-T, where the values from the table are used as additional references. BLEU-T draws inspiration from iBLEU BIBREF26 but instead rewards n-grams which match the table rather than penalizing them. For PARENT, we compare both the word-overlap model (PARENT-W) and the co-occurrence model (PARENT-C) for determining entailment. We also compare versions where a single INLINEFORM0 is tuned on the entire dataset to maximize correlation with human judgments, denoted as PARENT*-W/C.\nCorrelation Comparison\nWe use bootstrap sampling (500 iterations) over the 1100 tables for which we collected human annotations to get an idea of how the correlation of each metric varies with the underlying data. In each iteration, we sample with replacement, tables along with their references and all the generated texts for that table. Then we compute aggregated human evaluation and metric scores for each of the models and compute the correlation between the two. We report the average correlation across all bootstrap samples for each metric in Table TABREF37 . The distribution of correlations for the best performing metrics are shown in Figure FIGREF38 .\nTable TABREF37 also indicates whether PARENT is significantly better than a baseline metric. BIBREF21 suggest using the William's test for this purpose, but since we are computing correlations between only 4/13 systems at a time, this test has very weak power in our case. Hence, we use the bootstrap samples to obtain a INLINEFORM0 confidence interval of the difference in correlation between PARENT and any other metric and check whether this is above 0 BIBREF27 .\nCorrelations are higher for the systems category than the hyperparams category. The latter is a more difficult setting since very similar models are compared, and hence the variance of the correlations is also high. Commonly used metrics which only rely on the reference (BLEU, ROUGE, METEOR, CIDEr) have only weak correlations with human judgments. In the hyperparams category, these are often negative, implying that tuning models based on these may lead to selecting worse models. BLEU performs the best among these, and adding n-grams from the table as references improves this further (BLEU-T).\nAmong the extractive evaluation metrics, CS, which also only relies on the reference, has poor correlation in the hyperparams category. RG-F, and both variants of the PARENT metric achieve the highest correlation for both settings. There is no significant difference among these for the hyperparams category, but for systems, PARENT-W is significantly better than the other two. While RG-F needs a full information extraction pipeline in its implementation, PARENT-C only relies on co-occurrence counts, and PARENT-W can be used out-of-the-box for any dataset. To our knowledge, this is the first rigorous evaluation of using information extraction for generation evaluation.\nOn this dataset, the word-overlap model showed higher correlation than the co-occurrence model for entailment. In \u00a7 SECREF47 we will show that for the WebNLG dataset, where more paraphrasing is involved between the table and text, the opposite is true. Lastly, we note that the heuristic for selecting INLINEFORM0 is sufficient to produce high correlations for PARENT, however, if human annotations are available, this can be tuned to produce significantly higher correlations (PARENT*-W/C).\nAnalysis\nIn this section we further analyze the performance of PARENT-W under different conditions, and compare to the other best metrics from Table TABREF37 .\nTo study the correlation as we vary the number of divergent references, we also collected binary labels from workers for whether a reference is entailed by the corresponding table. We define a reference as entailed when it mentions only information which can be inferred from the table. Each table and reference pair was judged by 3 independent workers, and we used the majority vote as the label for that pair. Overall, only INLINEFORM0 of the references were labeled as entailed by the table. Fleiss' INLINEFORM1 was INLINEFORM2 , which indicates a fair agreement. We found the workers sometimes disagreed on what information can be reasonably entailed by the table.\nFigure FIGREF40 shows the correlations as we vary the percent of entailed examples in the evaluation set of WikiBio. Each point is obtained by fixing the desired proportion of entailed examples, and sampling subsets from the full set which satisfy this proportion. PARENT and RG-F remain stable and show a high correlation across the entire range, whereas BLEU and BLEU-T vary a lot. In the hyperparams category, the latter two have the worst correlation when the evaluation set contains only entailed examples, which may seem surprising. However, on closer examination we found that this subset tends to omit a lot of information from the tables. Systems which produce more information than these references are penalized by BLEU, but not in the human evaluation. PARENT overcomes this issue by measuring recall against the table in addition to the reference.\nWe check how different components in the computation of PARENT contribute to its correlation to human judgments. Specifically, we remove the probability INLINEFORM0 of an n-gram INLINEFORM1 being entailed by the table from Eqs. EQREF19 and EQREF23 . The average correlation for PARENT-W drops to INLINEFORM5 in this case. We also try a variant of PARENT with INLINEFORM6 , which removes the contribution of Table Recall (Eq. EQREF22 ). The average correlation is INLINEFORM7 in this case. With these components, the correlation is INLINEFORM8 , showing that they are crucial to the performance of PARENT.\nBIBREF28 point out that hill-climbing on an automatic metric is meaningless if that metric has a low instance-level correlation to human judgments.

Both variants of PARENT are significantly better than the other metrics, however the best accuracy is only INLINEFORM0 for the binary task.

One of the most common strategies to tackle the problem is to train systems capable of recognizing offensive content, which then can be deleted or set aside for human moderation. In the last few years, there have been several studies published on the application of computational methods to deal with this problem. Most prior work focuses on a different aspect of offensive language such as abusive language BIBREF0 , BIBREF1 , (cyber-)aggression BIBREF2 , (cyber-)bullying BIBREF3 , BIBREF4 , toxic comments INLINEFORM0 , hate speech BIBREF5 , BIBREF6 , BIBREF7 , BIBREF8 , BIBREF9 , BIBREF10 , and offensive language BIBREF11 . Prior work has focused on these aspects of offensive language in Twitter BIBREF3 , BIBREF7 , BIBREF8 , BIBREF11 , Wikipedia comments, and Facebook posts BIBREF2 .\nRecently, Waseem et. al. ( BIBREF12 ) acknowledged the similarities among prior work and discussed the need for a typology that differentiates between whether the (abusive) language is directed towards a specific individual or entity or towards a generalized group and whether the abusive content is explicit or implicit. Wiegand et al. ( BIBREF11 ) followed this trend as well on German tweets. In their evaluation, they have a task to detect offensive vs not offensive tweets and a second task for distinguishing between the offensive tweets as profanity, insult, or abuse. However, no prior work has explored the target of the offensive language, which is important in many scenarios, e.g., when studying hate speech with respect to a specific target.\nTherefore, we expand on these ideas by proposing a a hierarchical three-level annotation model that encompasses:\nUsing this annotation model, we create a new large publicly available dataset of English tweets. The key contributions of this paper are as follows:\nRelated Work\nDifferent abusive and offense language identification sub-tasks have been explored in the past few years including aggression identification, bullying detection, hate speech, toxic comments, and offensive language.\nAggression identification: The TRAC shared task on Aggression Identification BIBREF2 provided participants with a dataset containing 15,000 annotated Facebook posts and comments in English and Hindi for training and validation. For testing, two different sets, one from Facebook and one from Twitter were provided. Systems were trained to discriminate between three classes: non-aggressive, covertly aggressive, and overtly aggressive.\nBullying detection: Several studies have been published on bullying detection. One of them is the one by xu2012learning which apply sentiment analysis to detect bullying in tweets. xu2012learning use topic models to to identify relevant topics in bullying. Another related study is the one by dadvar2013improving which use user-related features such as the frequency of profanity in previous messages to improve bullying detection.\nHate speech identification: It is perhaps the most widespread abusive language detection sub-task. There have been several studies published on this sub-task such as kwok2013locate and djuric2015hate who build a binary classifier to distinguish between `clean' comments and comments containing hate speech and profanity. More recently, Davidson et al. davidson2017automated presented the hate speech detection dataset containing over 24,000 English tweets labeled as non offensive, hate speech, and profanity.\nOffensive language: The GermEval BIBREF11 shared task focused on Offensive language identification in German tweets. A dataset of over 8,500 annotated tweets was provided for a course-grained binary classification task in which systems were trained to discriminate between offensive and non-offensive tweets and a second task where the organizers broke down the offensive class into three classes: profanity, insult, and abuse.\nToxic comments: The Toxic Comment Classification Challenge was an open competition at Kaggle which provided participants with comments from Wikipedia labeled in six classes: toxic, severe toxic, obscene, threat, insult, identity hate.\nWhile each of these sub-tasks tackle a particular type of abuse or offense, they share similar properties and the hierarchical annotation model proposed in this paper aims to capture this. Considering that, for example, an insult targeted at an individual is commonly known as cyberbulling and that insults targeted at a group are known as hate speech, we pose that OLID's hierarchical annotation model makes it a useful resource for various offensive language identification sub-tasks.\nHierarchically Modelling Offensive Content\nIn the OLID dataset, we use a hierarchical annotation model split into three levels to distinguish between whether language is offensive or not (A), and type (B) and target (C) of the offensive language. Each level is described in more detail in the following subsections and examples are shown in Table TABREF10 .\nLevel A: Offensive language Detection\nLevel A discriminates between offensive (OFF) and non-offensive (NOT) tweets.\nNot Offensive (NOT): Posts that do not contain offense or profanity;\nOffensive (OFF): We label a post as offensive if it contains any form of non-acceptable language (profanity) or a targeted offense, which can be veiled or direct. This category includes insults, threats, and posts containing profane language or swear words.\nLevel B: Categorization of Offensive Language\nLevel B categorizes the type of offense and two labels are used: targeted (TIN) and untargeted (INT) insults and threats.\nTargeted Insult (TIN): Posts which contain an insult/threat to an individual, group, or others (see next layer);\nUntargeted (UNT): Posts containing non-targeted profanity and swearing. Posts with general profanity are not targeted, but they contain non-acceptable language.\nLevel C: Offensive Language Target Identification\nLevel C categorizes the targets of insults and threats as individual (IND), group (GRP), and other (OTH).\nIndividual (IND): Posts targeting an individual. It can be a a famous person, a named individual or an unnamed participant in the conversation. Insults and threats targeted at individuals are often defined as cyberbulling.\nGroup (GRP): The target of these offensive posts is a group of people considered as a unity due to the same ethnicity, gender or sexual orientation, political affiliation, religious belief, or other common characteristic. Many of the insults and threats targeted at a group correspond to what is commonly understood as hate speech.\nOther (OTH): The target of these offensive posts does not belong to any of the previous two categories (e.g. an organization, a situation, an event, or an issue).\nData Collection\nThe data included in OLID has been collected from Twitter. We retrieved the data using the Twitter API by searching for keywords and constructions that are often included in offensive messages, such as `she is' or `to:BreitBartNews'. We carried out a first round of trial annotation of 300 instances with six experts. The goal of the trial annotation was to 1) evaluate the proposed tagset; 2) evaluate the data retrieval method; and 3) create a gold standard with instances that could be used as test questions in the training and test setting annotation which was carried out using crowdsourcing. The breakdown of keywords and their offensive content in the trial data of 300 tweets is shown in Table TABREF14 . We included a left (@NewYorker) and far-right (@BreitBartNews) news accounts because there tends to be political offense in the comments. One of the best offensive keywords was tweets that were flagged as not being safe by the Twitter `safe' filter (the `-' indicates `not safe'). The vast majority of content on Twitter is not offensive so we tried different strategies to keep a reasonable number of tweets in the offensive class amounting to around 30% of the dataset including excluding some keywords that were not high in offensive content such as `they are` and `to:NewYorker`. Although `he is' is lower in offensive content we kept it as a keyword to avoid gender bias. In addition to the keywords in the trial set, we searched for more political keywords which tend to be higher in offensive content, and sampled our dataset such that 50% of the the tweets come from political keywords and 50% come from non-political keywords. In addition to the keywords `gun control', and `to:BreitbartNews', political keywords used to collect these tweets are `MAGA', `antifa', `conservative' and `liberal'. We computed Fliess' INLINEFORM0 on the trial set for the five annotators on 21 of the tweets. INLINEFORM1 is .83 for Layer A (OFF vs NOT) indicating high agreement. As to normalization and anonymization, no user metadata or Twitter IDs have been stored, and URLs and Twitter mentions have been substituted to placeholders. We follow prior work in related areas (burnap2015cyber,davidson2017automated) and annotate our data using crowdsourcing using the platform Figure Eight. We ensure data quality by: 1) we only received annotations from individuals who were experienced in the platform; and 2) we used test questions to discard annotations of individuals who did not reach a certain threshold. Each instance in the dataset was annotated by multiple annotators and inter-annotator agreement has been calculated. We first acquired two annotations for each instance. In case of 100% agreement, we considered these as acceptable annotations, and in case of disagreement, we requested more annotations until the agreement was above 66%. After the crowdsourcing annotation, we used expert adjudication to guarantee the quality of the annotation. The breakdown of the data into training and testing for the labels from each level is shown in Table TABREF15 .\nExperiments and Evaluation\nWe assess our dataset using traditional and deep learning methods. Our simplest model is a linear SVM trained on word unigrams. SVMs have produced state-of-the-art results for many text classification tasks BIBREF13 . We also train a bidirectional Long Short-Term-Memory (BiLSTM) model, which we adapted from the sentiment analysis system of sentimentSystem,rasooli2018cross and altered to predict offensive labels instead. It consists of (1) an input embedding layer, (2) a bidirectional LSTM layer, (3) an average pooling layer of input features. The concatenation of the LSTM's and average pool layer is passed through a dense layer and the output is passed through a softmax function. We set two input channels for the input embedding layers: pre-trained FastText embeddings BIBREF14 , as well as updatable embeddings learned by the model during training. Finally, we also apply a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model based on the architecture of BIBREF15 , using the same multi-channel inputs as the above BiLSTM.\nOur models are trained on the training data, and evaluated by predicting the labels for the held-out test set. The distribution is described in Table TABREF15 . We evaluate and compare the models using the macro-averaged F1-score as the label distribution is highly imbalanced. Per-class Precision (P), Recall (R), and F1-score (F1), also with other averaged metrics are also reported. The models are compared against baselines of predicting all labels as the majority or minority classes.\nOffensive Language Detection\nThe performance on discriminating between offensive (OFF) and non-offensive (NOT) posts is reported in Table TABREF18 . We can see that all systems perform significantly better than chance, with the neural models being substantially better than the SVM. The CNN outperforms the RNN model, achieving a macro-F1 score of 0.80.\nCategorization of Offensive Language\nIn this experiment, the two systems were trained to discriminate between insults and threats (TIN) and untargeted (UNT) offenses, which generally refer to profanity. The results are shown in Table TABREF19 .\nThe CNN system achieved higher performance in this experiment compared to the BiLSTM, with a macro-F1 score of 0.69. All systems performed better at identifying target and threats (TIN) than untargeted offenses (UNT).\nOffensive Language Target Identification\nThe results of the offensive target identification experiment are reported in Table TABREF20 . Here the systems were trained to distinguish between three targets: a group (GRP), an individual (IND), or others (OTH). All three models achieved similar results far surpassing the random baselines, with a slight performance edge for the neural models.\nThe performance of all systems for the OTH class is 0. This poor performances can be explained by two main factors. First, unlike the two other classes, OTH is a heterogeneous collection of targets. It includes offensive tweets targeted at organizations, situations, events, etc. making it more challenging for systems to learn discriminative properties of this class. Second, this class contains fewer training instances than the other two. There are only 395 instances in OTH, and 1,075 in GRP, and 2,407 in IND.\nConclusion and Future Work\nThis paper presents OLID, a new dataset with annotation of type and target of offensive language. OLID is the official dataset of the shared task SemEval 2019 Task 6: Identifying and Categorizing Offensive Language in Social Media (OffensEval) BIBREF16 . In OffensEval, each annotation level in OLID is an independent sub-task. The dataset contains 14,100 tweets and is released freely to the research community. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first dataset to contain annotation of type and target of offenses in social media and it opens several new avenues for research in this area. We present baseline experiments using SVMs and neural networks to identify the offensive tweets, discriminate between insults, threats, and profanity, and finally to identify the target of the offensive messages. The results show that this is a challenging task. A CNN-based sentence classifier achieved the best results in all three sub-tasks.\nIn future work, we would like to make a cross-corpus comparison of OLID and datasets annotated for similar tasks such as aggression identification BIBREF2 and hate speech detection BIBREF8 . This comparison is, however, far from trivial as the annotation of OLID is different.\nAcknowledgments\nThe research presented in this paper was partially supported by an ERAS fellowship awarded by the University of Wolverhampton.\n\n Answer the question based on the above article as concisely as you can, using a single phrase or sentence if possible.

Do not provide any explanation.\n\nArticle: Introduction\nNamed Entity Recognition (NER) is a foremost NLP task to label each atomic elements of a sentence into specific categories like \"PERSON\", \"LOCATION\", \"ORGANIZATION\" and othersBIBREF0. There has been an extensive NER research on English, German, Dutch and Spanish language BIBREF1, BIBREF2, BIBREF3, BIBREF4, BIBREF5, and notable research on low resource South Asian languages like HindiBIBREF6, IndonesianBIBREF7 and other Indian languages (Kannada, Malayalam, Tamil and Telugu)BIBREF8. However, there has been no study on developing neural NER for Nepali language. In this paper, we propose a neural based Nepali NER using latest state-of-the-art architecture based on grapheme-level which doesn't require any hand-crafted features and no data pre-processing.\nRecent neural architecture like BIBREF1 is used to relax the need to hand-craft the features and need to use part-of-speech tag to determine the category of the entity. However, this architecture have been studied for languages like English, and German and not been applied to languages like Nepali which is a low resource language i.e limited data set to train the model. Traditional methods like Hidden Markov Model (HMM) with rule based approachesBIBREF9,BIBREF10, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) with manual feature-engineeringBIBREF11 have been applied but they perform poor compared to neural. However, there has been no research in Nepali NER using neural network. Therefore, we created the named entity annotated dataset partly with the help of Dataturk to train a neural model. The texts used for this dataset are collected from various daily news sources from Nepal around the year 2015-2016.\nFollowing are our contributions:\nWe present a novel Named Entity Recognizer (NER) for Nepali language. To best of our knowledge we are the first to propose neural based Nepali NER.\nAs there are not good quality dataset to train NER we release a dataset to support future research\nWe perform empirical evaluation of our model with state-of-the-art models with relative improvement of upto 10%\nIn this paper, we present works similar to ours in Section SECREF2. We describe our approach and dataset statistics in Section SECREF3 and SECREF4, followed by our experiments, evaluation and discussion in Section SECREF5, SECREF6, and SECREF7. We conclude with our observations in Section SECREF8.\nTo facilitate further research our code and dataset will be made available at github.com/link-yet-to-be-updated\nRelated Work\nThere has been a handful of research on Nepali NER task based on approaches like Support Vector Machine and gazetteer listBIBREF11 and Hidden Markov Model and gazetteer listBIBREF9,BIBREF10.\nBIBREF11 uses SVM along with features like first word, word length, digit features and gazetteer (person, organization, location, middle name, verb, designation and others). It uses one vs rest classification model to classify each word into different entity classes. However, it does not the take context word into account while training the model. Similarly, BIBREF9 and BIBREF10 uses Hidden Markov Model with n-gram technique for extracting POS-tags. POS-tags with common noun, proper noun or combination of both are combined together, then uses gazetteer list as look-up table to identify the named entities.\nResearchers have shown that the neural networks like CNNBIBREF12, RNNBIBREF13, LSTMBIBREF14, GRUBIBREF15 can capture the semantic knowledge of language better with the help of pre-trained embbeddings like word2vecBIBREF16, gloveBIBREF17 or fasttextBIBREF18.\nSimilar approaches has been applied to many South Asian languages like HindiBIBREF6, IndonesianBIBREF7, BengaliBIBREF19 and In this paper, we present the neural network architecture for NER task in Nepali language, which doesn't require any manual feature engineering nor any data pre-processing during training. First we are comparing BiLSTMBIBREF14, BiLSTM+CNNBIBREF20, BiLSTM+CRFBIBREF1, BiLSTM+CNN+CRFBIBREF2 models with CNN modelBIBREF0 and Stanford CRF modelBIBREF21. Secondly, we show the comparison between models trained on general word embeddings, word embedding + character-level embedding, word embedding + part-of-speech(POS) one-hot encoding and word embedding + grapheme clustered or sub-word embeddingBIBREF22. The experiments were performed on the dataset that we created and on the dataset received from ILPRL lab. Our extensive study shows that augmenting word embedding with character or grapheme-level representation and POS one-hot encoding vector yields better results compared to using general word embedding alone.\nApproach\nIn this section, we describe our approach in building our model. This model is partly inspired from multiple models BIBREF20,BIBREF1, andBIBREF2\nApproach ::: Bidirectional LSTM\nWe used Bi-directional LSTM to capture the word representation in forward as well as reverse direction of a sentence. Generally, LSTMs take inputs from left (past) of the sentence and computes the hidden state. However, it is proven beneficialBIBREF23 to use bi-directional LSTM, where, hidden states are computed based from right (future) of sentence and both of these hidden states are concatenated to produce the final output as $h_t$=[$\\overrightarrow{h_t}$;$\\overleftarrow{h_t}$], where $\\overrightarrow{h_t}$, $\\overleftarrow{h_t}$ = hidden state computed in forward and backward direction respectively.\nApproach ::: Features ::: Word embeddings\nWe have used Word2Vec BIBREF16, GloVe BIBREF17 and FastText BIBREF18 word vectors of 300 dimensions. These vectors were trained on the corpus obtained from Nepali National Corpus. This pre-lemmatized corpus consists of 14 million words from books, web-texts and news papers. This corpus was mixed with the texts from the dataset before training CBOW and skip-gram version of word2vec using gensim libraryBIBREF24. This trained model consists of vectors for 72782 unique words.\nLight pre-processing was performed on the corpus before training it. For example, invalid characters or characters other than Devanagari were removed but punctuation and numbers were not removed. We set the window context at 10 and the rare words whose count is below 5 are dropped. These word embeddings were not frozen during the training session because fine-tuning word embedding help achieve better performance compared to frozen oneBIBREF20.\nWe have used fasttext embeddings in particular because of its sub-word representation ability, which is very useful in highly inflectional language as shown in Table TABREF25. We have trained the word embedding in such a way that the sub-word size remains between 1 and 4. We particularly chose this size because in Nepali language a single letter can also be a word, for example e, t, C, r, l, n, u and a single character (grapheme) or sub-word can be formed after mixture of dependent vowel signs with consonant letters for example, C + O + = CO, here three different consonant letters form a single sub-word.\nThe two-dimensional visualization of an example word npAl is shown in FIGREF14. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) technique was used to generate this visualization which helps use to analyze the nearest neighbor words of a given sample word. 84 and 104 nearest neighbors were observed using word2vec and fasttext embedding respectively on the same corpus.\nApproach ::: Features ::: Character-level embeddings\nBIBREF20 and BIBREF2 successfully presented that the character-level embeddings, extracted using CNN, when combined with word embeddings enhances the NER model performance significantly, as it is able to capture morphological features of a word. Figure FIGREF7 shows the grapheme-level CNN used in our model, where inputs to CNN are graphemes. Character-level CNN is also built in similar fashion, except the inputs are characters. Grapheme or Character -level embeddings are randomly initialized from [0,1] with real values with uniform distribution of dimension 30.\nApproach ::: Features ::: Grapheme-level embeddings\nGrapheme is atomic meaningful unit in writing system of any languages. Since, Nepali language is highly morphologically inflectional, we compared grapheme-level representation with character-level representation to evaluate its effect. For example, in character-level embedding, each character of a word npAl results into n + + p + A + l has its own embedding. However, in grapheme level, a word npAl is clustered into graphemes, resulting into n + pA + l. Here, each grapheme has its own embedding. This grapheme-level embedding results good scores on par with character-level embedding in highly inflectional languages like Nepali, because graphemes also capture syntactic information similar to characters. We created grapheme clusters using uniseg package which is helpful in unicode text segmentations.\nApproach ::: Features ::: Part-of-speech (POS) one hot encoding\nWe created one-hot encoded vector of POS tags and then concatenated with pre-trained word embeddings before passing it to BiLSTM network. A sample of data is shown in figure FIGREF13.\nDataset Statistics ::: OurNepali dataset\nSince, we there was no publicly available standard Nepali NER dataset and did not receive any dataset from the previous researchers, we had to create our own dataset. This dataset contains the sentences collected from daily newspaper of the year 2015-2016. This dataset has three major classes Person (PER), Location (LOC) and Organization (ORG). Pre-processing was performed on the text before creation of the dataset, for example all punctuations and numbers besides ',', '-', '|' and '.' were removed. Currently, the dataset is in standard CoNLL-2003 IO formatBIBREF25.\nSince, this dataset is not lemmatized originally, we lemmatized only the post-positions like Ek, kO, l, mA, m, my, jF, sg, aEG which are just the few examples among 299 post positions in Nepali language. We obtained these post-positions from sanjaalcorps and added few more to match our dataset. We will be releasing this list in our github repository. We found out that lemmatizing the post-positions boosted the F1 score by almost 10%.\nIn order to label our dataset with POS-tags, we first created POS annotated dataset of 6946 sentences and 16225 unique words extracted from POS-tagged Nepali National Corpus and trained a BiLSTM model with 95.14% accuracy which was used to create POS-tags for our dataset.\nThe dataset released in our github repository contains each word in newline with space separated POS-tags and Entity-tags. The sentences are separated by empty newline. A sample sentence from the dataset is presented in table FIGREF13.\nDataset Statistics ::: ILPRL dataset\nAfter much time, we received the dataset from Bal Krishna Bal, ILPRL, KU. This dataset follows standard CoNLL-2003 IOB formatBIBREF25 with POS tags. This dataset is prepared by ILPRL Lab, KU and KEIV Technologies. Few corrections like correcting the NER tags had to be made on the dataset. The statistics of both the dataset is presented in table TABREF23.\nTable TABREF24 presents the total entities (PER, LOC, ORG and MISC) from both of the dataset used in our experiments. The dataset is divided into three parts with 64%, 16% and 20% of the total dataset into training set, development set and test set respectively.\nExperiments\nIn this section, we present the details about training our neural network. The neural network architecture are implemented using PyTorch framework BIBREF26. The training is performed on a single Nvidia Tesla P100 SXM2. We first run our experiment on BiLSTM, BiLSTM-CNN, BiLSTM-CRF BiLSTM-CNN-CRF using the hyper-parameters mentioned in Table TABREF30. The training and evaluation was done on sentence-level. The RNN variants are initialized randomly from $(-\\sqrt{k},\\sqrt{k})$ where $k=\\frac{1}{hidden\\_size}$.\nFirst we loaded our dataset and built vocabulary using torchtext library. This eased our process of data loading using its SequenceTaggingDataset class. We trained our model with shuffled training set using Adam optimizer with hyper-parameters mentioned in table TABREF30. All our models were trained on single layer of LSTM network. We found out Adam was giving better performance and faster convergence compared to Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). We chose those hyper-parameters after many ablation studies. The dropout of 0.5 is applied after LSTM layer.\nFor CNN, we used 30 different filters of sizes 3, 4 and 5. The embeddings of each character or grapheme involved in a given word, were passed through the pipeline of Convolution, Rectified Linear Unit and Max-Pooling. The resulting vectors were concatenated and applied dropout of 0.5 before passing into linear layer to obtain the embedding size of 30 for the given word. This resulting embedding is concatenated with word embeddings, which is again concatenated with one-hot POS vector.\nExperiments ::: Tagging Scheme\nCurrently, for our experiments we trained our model on IO (Inside, Outside) format for both the dataset, hence the dataset does not contain any B-type annotation unlike in BIO (Beginning, Inside, Outside) scheme.\nExperiments ::: Early Stopping\nWe used simple early stopping technique where if the validation loss does not decrease after 10 epochs, the training was stopped, else the training will run upto 100 epochs. In our experience, training usually stops around 30-50 epochs.\nExperiments ::: Hyper-parameters Tuning\nWe ran our experiment looking for the best hyper-parameters by changing learning rate from (0,1, 0.01, 0.001, 0.0001), weight decay from [$10^{-1}$, $10^{-2}$, $10^{-3}$, $10^{-4}$, $10^{-5}$, $10^{-6}$, $10^{-7}$], batch size from [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128], hidden size from [8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512 1024]. Table TABREF30 shows all other hyper-parameter used in our experiment for both of the dataset.\nExperiments ::: Effect of Dropout\nFigure FIGREF31 shows how we end up choosing 0.5 as dropout rate. When the dropout layer was not used, the F1 score are at the lowest. As, we slowly increase the dropout rate, the F1 score also gradually increases, however after dropout rate = 0.5, the F1 score starts falling down. Therefore, we have chosen 0.5 as dropout rate for all other experiments performed.\nEvaluation\nIn this section, we present the details regarding evaluation and comparison of our models with other baselines.\nTable TABREF25 shows the study of various embeddings and comparison among each other in OurNepali dataset. Here, raw dataset represents such dataset where post-positions are not lemmatized. We can observe that pre-trained embeddings significantly improves the score compared to randomly initialized embedding. We can deduce that Skip Gram models perform better compared CBOW models for word2vec and fasttext. Here, fastText_Pretrained represents the embedding readily available in fastText website, while other embeddings are trained on the Nepali National Corpus as mentioned in sub-section SECREF11. From this table TABREF25, we can clearly observe that model using fastText_Skip Gram embeddings outperforms all other models.\nTable TABREF35 shows the model architecture comparison between all the models experimented. The features used for Stanford CRF classifier are words, letter n-grams of upto length 6, previous word and next word. This model is trained till the current function value is less than $1\\mathrm {e}{-2}$. The hyper-parameters of neural network experiments are set as shown in table TABREF30. Since, word embedding of character-level and grapheme-level is random, their scores are near.\nAll models are evaluated using CoNLL-2003 evaluation scriptBIBREF25 to calculate entity-wise precision, recall and f1 score.\nDiscussion\nIn this paper we present that we can exploit the power of neural network to train the model to perform downstream NLP tasks like Named Entity Recognition even in Nepali language. We showed that the word vectors learned through fasttext skip gram model performs better than other word embedding because of its capability to represent sub-word and this is particularly important to capture morphological structure of words and sentences in highly inflectional like Nepali. This concept can come handy in other Devanagari languages as well because the written scripts have similar syntactical structure.\nWe also found out that stemming post-positions can help a lot in improving model performance because of inflectional characteristics of Nepali language. So when we separate out its inflections or morphemes, we can minimize the variations of same word which gives its root word a stronger word vector representations compared to its inflected versions.\nWe can clearly imply from tables TABREF23, TABREF24, and TABREF35 that we need more data to get better results because OurNepali dataset volume is almost ten times bigger compared to ILPRL dataset in terms of entities.\nConclusion and Future work\nIn this paper, we proposed a novel NER for Nepali language and achieved relative improvement of upto 10% and studies different factors effecting the performance of the NER for Nepali language.\nWe also present a neural architecture BiLSTM+CNN(grapheme-level) which turns out to be performing on par with BiLSTM+CNN(character-level) under the same configuration. We believe this will not only help Nepali language but also other languages falling under the umbrellas of Devanagari languages. Our model BiLSTM+CNN(grapheme-level) and BiLSTM+CNN(G)+POS outperforms all other model experimented in OurNepali and ILPRL dataset respectively.\nSince this is the first named entity recognition research in Nepal language using neural network, there are many rooms for improvement. We believe initializing the grapheme-level embedding with fasttext embeddings might help boosting the performance, rather than randomly initializing it. In future, we plan to apply other latest techniques like BERT, ELMo and FLAIR to study its effect on low-resource language like Nepali. We also plan to improve the model using cross-lingual or multi-lingual parameter sharing techniques by jointly training with other Devanagari languages like Hindi and Bengali.\nFinally, we would like to contribute our dataset to Nepali NLP community to move forward the research going on in language understanding domain. We believe there should be special committee to create and maintain such dataset for Nepali NLP and organize various competitions which would elevate the NLP research in Nepal.\nSome of the future works are listed below:\nProper initialization of grapheme level embedding from fasttext embeddings.\nApply robust POS-tagger for Nepali dataset\nLemmatize the OurNepali dataset with robust and efficient lemmatizer\nImprove Nepali language score with cross-lingual learning techniques\nCreate more dataset using Wikipedia/Wikidata framework\nAcknowledgments\nThe authors of this paper would like to express sincere thanks to Bal Krishna Bal, Kathmandu University Professor for providing us the POS-tagged Nepali NER data.\n\n Answer the question based on the above article as concisely as you can, using a single phrase or sentence if possible. If the question cannot be answered based on the information in the article, write \"unanswerable\". If the question is a yes/no question, answer \"yes\", \"no\", or \"unanswerable\". Do not provide any explanation.\n\nQuestion: Which machine learning models do they explore?\n\nAnswer:", "input": "Which machine learning models do they explore?", "context": "Introduction\nNamed Entity Recognition (NER) is a foremost NLP task to label each atomic elements of a sentence into specific categories like \"PERSON\", \"LOCATION\", \"ORGANIZATION\" and othersBIBREF0. There has been an extensive NER research on English, German, Dutch and Spanish language BIBREF1, BIBREF2, BIBREF3, BIBREF4, BIBREF5, and notable research on low resource South Asian languages like HindiBIBREF6, IndonesianBIBREF7 and other Indian languages (Kannada, Malayalam, Tamil and Telugu)BIBREF8. However, there has been no study on developing neural NER for Nepali language. In this paper, we propose a neural based Nepali NER using latest state-of-the-art architecture based on grapheme-level which doesn't require any hand-crafted features and no data pre-processing.\nRecent neural architecture like BIBREF1 is used to relax the need to hand-craft the features and need to use part-of-speech tag to determine the category of the entity. However, this architecture have been studied for languages like English, and German and not been applied to languages like Nepali which is a low resource language i.e limited data set to train the model. Traditional methods like Hidden Markov Model (HMM) with rule based approachesBIBREF9,BIBREF10, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) with manual feature-engineeringBIBREF11 have been applied but they perform poor compared to neural. However, there has been no research in Nepali NER using neural network. Therefore, we created the named entity annotated dataset partly with the help of Dataturk to train a neural model. The texts used for this dataset are collected from various daily news sources from Nepal around the year 2015-2016.\nFollowing are our contributions:\nWe present a novel Named Entity Recognizer (NER) for Nepali language. To best of our knowledge we are the first to propose neural based Nepali NER.\nAs there are not good quality dataset to train NER we release a dataset to support future research\nWe perform empirical evaluation of our model with state-of-the-art models with relative improvement of upto 10%\nIn this paper, we present works similar to ours in Section SECREF2. We describe our approach and dataset statistics in Section SECREF3 and SECREF4, followed by our experiments, evaluation and discussion in Section SECREF5, SECREF6, and SECREF7. We conclude with our observations in Section SECREF8.\nTo facilitate further research our code and dataset will be made available at github.com/link-yet-to-be-updated\nRelated Work\nThere has been a handful of research on Nepali NER task based on approaches like Support Vector Machine and gazetteer listBIBREF11 and Hidden Markov Model and gazetteer listBIBREF9,BIBREF10.\nBIBREF11 uses SVM along with features like first word, word length, digit features and gazetteer (person, organization, location, middle name, verb, designation and others). It uses one vs rest classification model to classify each word into different entity classes. However, it does not the take context word into account while training the model. Similarly, BIBREF9 and BIBREF10 uses Hidden Markov Model with n-gram technique for extracting POS-tags. POS-tags with common noun, proper noun or combination of both are combined together, then uses gazetteer list as look-up table to identify the named entities.\nResearchers have shown that the neural networks like CNNBIBREF12, RNNBIBREF13, LSTMBIBREF14, GRUBIBREF15 can capture the semantic knowledge of language better with the help of pre-trained embbeddings like word2vecBIBREF16, gloveBIBREF17 or fasttextBIBREF18.\nSimilar approaches has been applied to many South Asian languages like HindiBIBREF6, IndonesianBIBREF7, BengaliBIBREF19 and In this paper, we present the neural network architecture for NER task in Nepali language, which doesn't require any manual feature engineering nor any data pre-processing during training. First we are comparing BiLSTMBIBREF14, BiLSTM+CNNBIBREF20, BiLSTM+CRFBIBREF1, BiLSTM+CNN+CRFBIBREF2 models with CNN modelBIBREF0 and Stanford CRF modelBIBREF21. Secondly, we show the comparison between models trained on general word embeddings, word embedding + character-level embedding, word embedding + part-of-speech(POS) one-hot encoding and word embedding + grapheme clustered or sub-word embeddingBIBREF22. The experiments were performed on the dataset that we created and on the dataset received from ILPRL lab. Our extensive study shows that augmenting word embedding with character or grapheme-level representation and POS one-hot encoding vector yields better results compared to using general word embedding alone.\nApproach\nIn this section, we describe our approach in building our model. This model is partly inspired from multiple models BIBREF20,BIBREF1, andBIBREF2\nApproach ::: Bidirectional LSTM\nWe used Bi-directional LSTM to capture the word representation in forward as well as reverse direction of a sentence. Generally, LSTMs take inputs from left (past) of the sentence and computes the hidden state. However, it is proven beneficialBIBREF23 to use bi-directional LSTM, where, hidden states are computed based from right (future) of sentence and both of these hidden states are concatenated to produce the final output as $h_t$=[$\\overrightarrow{h_t}$;$\\overleftarrow{h_t}$], where $\\overrightarrow{h_t}$, $\\overleftarrow{h_t}$ = hidden state computed in forward and backward direction respectively.\nApproach ::: Features ::: Word embeddings\nWe have used Word2Vec BIBREF16, GloVe BIBREF17 and FastText BIBREF18 word vectors of 300 dimensions.
