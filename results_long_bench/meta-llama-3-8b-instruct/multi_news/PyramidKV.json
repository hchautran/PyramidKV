NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Michael David Elliot, 40, was arrested in Kankakee Township in rural LaPorte County, Ind., and allegedly stole a total of four vehicles in his 24-hour run from the law. He was arraigned Tuesday in Indiana on auto theft charges. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The sheriff\u2019s department had been looking for a black 2002 Chevrolet Monte Carlo that was stolen from the area of Boyd Avenue and E. Lincolnway in LaPorte, authorities said. Deputy Jeffrey Wright said the vehicle\u2019s engine was on so it would warm up when it was taken. The sheriff\u2019s department was alerted to the theft at 6:16 p.m. ET, according to a Monday night news release. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Within minutes of learning of the theft, Deputy Slawek Czupryna spotted the stolen vehicle headed south on Boyd Boulevard in LaPorte. He attempted a traffic stop, but the driver didn\u2019t pull over. Instead, the driver fled, leading deputies on a short chase. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Stop Sticks were deployed just before 6:30 p.m., the sheriff\u2019s office said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cHe ran over a couple of sets of Stop Sticks that some of our sergeants had laid out, so his tires were going flat. He lost control of the vehicle and slid into a snowbank,\u201d Deputy Wright told 24 Hour News 8. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That snowbank was at the T-intersection of N 250 E between East Division and E 150 N in Kankakee Township, east of LaPorte. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Elliot then tried to climb out of the car\u2019s window, Wright said. Deputies Czupryna and Wright each grabbed one of Elliot\u2019s shoulders, pulled him from the car, laid him on the ground and handcuffed him. No one was hurt. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When asked what his name was, Elliot answered truthfully, Wright said. He said he asked Elliot if he was \u201c\u2018the Michael Elliot,\u201d and Elliot confirmed he was the escapee. Wright said he was surprised that Elliot didn\u2019t lie about his identity. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Wright then put Elliot into the back of his cruiser and took him to the LaPorte County Jail. Elliot is being held without bond on felony car theft and resisting charges. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Wright described Elliot was polite to officers, and quiet and emotionless during the ride to jail. Elliot looked tired, Wright said, like he had not slept in days. Wright said Elliot was wearing jeans that were too big and \u201ca couple of jackets.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Wright said authorities didn\u2019t know Elliot would be in their area \u2014 there was more concern he may be in the Shipshewana area \u2014 and that he did not expect the man he was chasing to be Elliot.

Elliot then got through a hole in the fencing system which, according to a former corrections officer, is made up of two 12-foot high, razor wire-topped fencing sections with a smaller, electrified fence in between them. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He then made a three-and-a-half mile trek into Ionia where he carjacked a woman, police said. The two then drove to the Elkhart, Ind. area. The woman escaped at a gas station there and he fled in her Jeep Liberty. That SUV was found early Monday morning in Shipshewana, Ind. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR LaPorte County, where Elliot was arrested, is west of Shipshewana.

Vickie Currie, her boyfriend Michael Tufnell, his cousin Bruce Squires Tufnell Jr. and fiancee Cathy Lave were killed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Charles and Paul Treece, and Tammy LaCross were with Elliot when the murders were committed.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The manhunt for 40-year- old Elliot started Sunday night, after he escaped from Ionia Correctional Facility in Michigan. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Elliot was convicted of four murders in 1993 and is serving five life sentences. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Michigan Department of Corrections Director Dan Heyns says officers realized Elliot was gone during a routine count at about 9 p.m. Sunday. After looking at surveillance tapes, they realized he escaped somewhere between 6 p.m. and 7 p.m. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Heyns says during the time of the escape, Elliot was dressed in a white kitchen uniform. It is unknown at this time how he got that uniform. Heyns says Elliot was not assigned to the kitchen. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR They believe it was the color of that uniform that had something to do with his ability to get by multiple security cameras and interior and perimeter fencing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After escaping, Elliot carjacked a woman using a box cutter. He held her hostage during the more than 100-mile drive to Elkhart County. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR They stopped for gas around 11 p.m. at a Marathon gas station near the intersection of SR 13 and CR 2, near Middlebury. The woman escaped Elliot at the station by asking for a cup for water, then locking herself in the bathroom and calling 911. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Elliot fled in the victim's car before police arrived. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Indiana State Police say the red Jeep Liberty he fled in was found in the 400 block of North State Street in Shipshewana Monday afternoon. A woman living in the neighborhood noticed the car matched the description of one given on the news, so she called police around 12:15 p.m. But, police say the car was seen in the area as early as 5:30 a.m. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"You can go a lot of places in seven hours,\" said Sgt. Ron Galaviz with the Indiana State Police. \"Especially if you have a mode of transportation. And, I'm not suggesting he does. But, again, we're looking for stolen vehicle reports or anything of that nature to help follow up on, to help us pursue on that trail.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Police went door-to-door looking for any signs of Elliot in Shipshewana. Westview Schools were notified of the situation and placed on lock down. Students were later dismissed, with a heavy police presence on site to ensure their safety. Police say all students were accounted for and the schools were thoroughly searched. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Indiana State Police say after searching the community, their hunt for Elliot in Shipshewana has been suspended and they have no new leads. They don't know if he is still in Michiana or has traveled elsewhere since abandoning the Jeep. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"What we're asking the public to do is to remain vigilant,\" Galaviz said. \"If you see something, say something. If something appears out of order, if a door seems unlocked, if a window is broken, don't investigate it. Call 911.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \\NBC affiliate WSMV in Nashville says early Monday morning, a woman thought she spotted Elliot at a Tennessee gas station. But, police say it was a false identification. Elliot has family in Tennessee. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He is described as a 5'8, 165-pound white male with brown hair and eyes. Elliot was wearing a blue and orange state prison uniform when he escaped, but he was last seen in black pants, a white t-shirt, white tennis shoes and a white beanie cap. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Elliot should be considered armed and dangerous. Anyone who comes in contact with him, should contact law enforcement immediately.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Results in Brief NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The California Whistleblower Protection Act (Whistleblower Act) empowers the California State Auditor's Office (State Auditor) to investigate and report on improper governmental activities by agencies and employees of the State. Under the Whistleblower Act, an improper governmental activity includes any action by a state agency or employee related to state government that violates a law; is economically wasteful; or involves gross misconduct, incompetence, or inefficiency. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR From July 1, 2017, through June 30, 2018, the State Auditor conducted investigative work on 1,481 cases. This report contains seven examples of investigations that substantiated improper governmental activities, including misuse of state time and inaccurate attendance records, economically wasteful activities, and misuse of government property. In addition, during the past year, the State Auditor issued nonpublic reports regarding nepotism, bad-faith hires, improper promotions, and other misconduct by executive management within two state entities. It provided these reports to those who could remediate the problems and ensure that the management teams involved did not retaliate against perceived whistleblowers. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR California State University, Fresno NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Two facilities operations employees at California State University, Fresno engaged in egregious and continued time and attendance abuse by taking extended breaks or leaving campus without accounting for their time. From 2013 through 2017, two employees failed to account for more than 5,100 hours of work, costing the State more than $111,000 in salary paid for work not performed. Furthermore, the employees were dishonest in their attempts to conceal their time and attendance abuse. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, Kern Valley State Prison NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For about two years, an employee at Kern Valley State Prison misused state time by regularly leaving work up to 45 minutes early as a result of inadequate supervision.

During this period, the LVN continued to receive her pay as a nurse even though she provided patient care only when she worked occasional overtime shifts, causing California Correctional Health Care Services (Correctional Health Care) to waste $10,500 in unnecessary salary payments. Furthermore, the nursing director's decision cost the State an additional $18,700 in unnecessary overtime payments that Correctional Health Care paid to other nurses to cover the LVN's originally assigned post, resulting in total waste of nearly $30,000. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) overpaid a staff services analyst (analyst) at one of its prisons nearly $3,000 from July 2016 through March 2017.

In addition, the associate warden violated state law by choosing not to initiate any collection efforts after two internal audits in 2017 documented the error in pay and recommended the recovery of the overpayments.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The report estimates the employee slept three or more hours daily at her desk since February 2014, totaling over 2,200 hours of work time and costing more than $40,000. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The employee worked as a key data operator. Her duties included \"routine data entry for change of address and new vehicle ownership forms,\" the report says. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She processed less than half the documents that she was expected to \u2013 an average of 200 documents a day, when key data operators are expected to process more than 550, according to the report.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Two employees either took extended breaks or left the premises over a five\u2011year period. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR One employee regularly left early from work over two years. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR One employee slept at her desk for extended periods of time during work hours.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u00bb An official built an unauthorized structure on state property with the help of on\u2011duty staff under his command. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Results in Brief NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The California Whistleblower Protection Act (Whistleblower Act) empowers the California State Auditor's Office (State Auditor) to investigate and report on improper governmental activities by agencies and employees of the State. Under the Whistleblower Act, an improper governmental activity includes any action by a state agency or employee related to state government that violates a law; is economically wasteful; or involves gross misconduct, incompetence, or inefficiency. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR From July 1, 2017, through June 30, 2018, the State Auditor conducted investigative work on 1,481 cases. This report contains seven examples of investigations that substantiated improper governmental activities, including misuse of state time and inaccurate attendance records, economically wasteful activities, and misuse of government property. In addition, during the past year, the State Auditor issued nonpublic reports regarding nepotism, bad-faith hires, improper promotions, and other misconduct by executive management within two state entities. It provided these reports to those who could remediate the problems and ensure that the management teams involved did not retaliate against perceived whistleblowers. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR California State University, Fresno NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Two facilities operations employees at California State University, Fresno engaged in egregious and continued time and attendance abuse by taking extended breaks or leaving campus without accounting for their time. From 2013 through 2017, two employees failed to account for more than 5,100 hours of work, costing the State more than $111,000 in salary paid for work not performed. Furthermore, the employees were dishonest in their attempts to conceal their time and attendance abuse. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, Kern Valley State Prison NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For about two years, an employee at Kern Valley State Prison misused state time by regularly leaving work up to 45 minutes early as a result of inadequate supervision. We estimated that the employee failed to account for 312 hours of missed work time, costing the State nearly $9,000. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Department of Motor Vehicles NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A key data operator at the Department of Motor Vehicles failed to perform her essential duties over a period of nearly four years because she slept at her desk for extended periods of time during work hours. From February 2014 through December 2017, the employee misused more than 2,200 hours of work time as a result of sleeping on the job, costing the State more than $40,000. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR California Correctional Health Care Services NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR From May 2015 through July 2016, a director of nursing (nursing director) at a Southern California adult prison removed a licensed vocational nurse (LVN), who was her personal friend, from her assigned nursing position\u2014or post\u2014providing patient care and reassigned her to perform nurse scheduling duties typically performed by an office technician. During this period, the LVN continued to receive her pay as a nurse even though she provided patient care only when she worked occasional overtime shifts, causing California Correctional Health Care Services (Correctional Health Care) to waste $10,500 in unnecessary salary payments. Furthermore, the nursing director's decision cost the State an additional $18,700 in unnecessary overtime payments that Correctional Health Care paid to other nurses to cover the LVN's originally assigned post, resulting in total waste of nearly $30,000. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) overpaid a staff services analyst (analyst) at one of its prisons nearly $3,000 from July 2016 through March 2017. The analyst, her manager, an associate warden, and a personnel specialist all failed to follow CDCR procedure and the California Department of Human Resources' policy regarding inmate supervision pay, which resulted in the overpayments. In addition, the associate warden violated state law by choosing not to initiate any collection efforts after two internal audits in 2017 documented the error in pay and recommended the recovery of the overpayments. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR California State University, Dominguez Hills NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In March 2013, a manager at California State University, Dominguez Hills directed a member of his staff to purchase a Nissan-manufactured electric vehicle quick charger for nearly $7,000 before the manager had performed the due diligence necessary to ensure that the equipment was compatible with the energy resource plan for the campus. The quick charger has remained unused for five years, its warranty lapsed in 2014, and Nissan is no longer manufacturing replacement parts. As of February 2018, the campus told us it will be unable to install the quick charger before 2020 or 2021, if at all. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CAL FIRE) assistant chief misused state resources when he violated his rental agreement by building an unauthorized structure on state property using on-duty staff under his command. In 2016 the assistant chief built a 16-foot-by-20-foot structure with plumbing, electrical, and sewer connections in the backyard of the state residence he rented from CAL FIRE without written approval from CAL FIRE to build the structure as his rental agreement required. He also did not have approval from the Office of the State Fire Marshal, which is responsible for inspecting state\u2011owned buildings.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Islamist President Mohamed Mursi returned to work on Wednesday, a day after slipping out of the palace when it came under siege from protesters furious about his drive to push through a new constitution. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mahmoud Ghozlan, spokesman for the Brotherhood, was quoted on the group's Facebook page as saying the abuses were committed by groups that \"imagined they could shake legitimacy or impose their view with force\".\nPassage 2:\n* Rival factions hurl petrol bombs, stones outside palace NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR * Clinton calls for dialogue on contested constitution NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR * Vice president offers olive branch to opposition NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR By Yasmine Saleh and Marwa Awad NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR CAIRO, Dec 5 (Reuters) - Islamists fought protesters outside the Egyptian president's palace on Wednesday, while inside the building his deputy proposed a way to end a crisis over a draft constitution that has split the most populous Arab nation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Stones and petrol bombs flew between opposition protesters and supporters of President Mohamed Mursi who had flocked to the palace in response to a call from the Muslim Brotherhood. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Two Islamists were hit in the legs by what their friends said were bullets fired during the clashes in streets around the compound in northern Cairo. One of them was bleeding heavily. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A leftist group said Islamists had cut off the ear of one of its members. Medical sources said 23 people had been wounded in clashes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Riot police deployed between the two sides to try to stop the confrontations which flared after dark despite an attempt by Vice President Mahmoud Mekky to calm the political crisis. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He said amendments to disputed articles in the draft constitution could be agreed with the opposition. A written agreement could then be submitted to the next parliament, to be elected after a referendum on the constitution on Dec. 15. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"There must be consensus,\" he told a news conference, saying opposition demands had to be respected to reach a solution. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Facing the gravest crisis of his six-month-old tenure, Mursi has shown no sign of buckling, confident that Islamists can win the referendum and a parliamentary election to follow. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Many Egyptians yearn for an end to political upheaval that has scared off investors and tourists, damaging the economy. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Egypt's opposition coalition blamed Mursi for the violence around his palace and said it was ready for dialogue if the Islamist leader scrapped a decree he issued on Nov. 22 that gave him wide powers and shielded his decisions from judicial review. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We hold President Mursi and his government completely responsible for the violence happening in Egypt today,\" opposition coordinator Mohamed ElBaradei told a news conference. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR POLARISATION NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We are ready for dialogue if the constitutional decree is cancelled ... and the referendum on this constitution is postponed,\" he said of the document written by an Islamist-led assembly that the opposition says ignores its concerns. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Today what is happening in the Egyptian street, polarisation and division, is something that could and is actually drawing us to violence and could draw us to something worse,\" the former head of the U.N. nuclear watchdog added. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Opposition leaders have previously urged Mursi to retract the Nov. 22 decree, defer the referendum and agree to revise the constitution, but have not echoed calls from street protesters for his overthrow and the \"downfall of the regime\". NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mursi has said his decree was needed to prevent courts still full of judges appointed by ousted strongman Hosni Mubarak from derailing a constitution vital for Egypt's political transition. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Rival groups skirmished outside the presidential palace earlier on Wednesday. Islamist supporters of Mursi tore down tents erected by leftist foes, who had begun a sit-in there. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"They hit us and destroyed our tents. Are you happy, Mursi? Aren't we Egyptians too?\" asked protester Haitham Ahmed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mohamed Mohy, a pro-Mursi demonstrator who was filming the scene, said: \"We are here to support our president and his decisions and save our country from traitors and agents.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mekky said street mobilisation by both sides posed a \"real danger\" to Egypt. \"If we do not put a stop to this phenomenon right away ... where are we headed? We must calm down.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton weighed into Egypt's political debate, saying dialogue was urgently needed on the new constitution, which should \"respect the rights of all citizens\". NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR DIALOGUE NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Clinton and Mursi worked together last month to broker a truce between Israel and Hamas Islamists in the Gaza Strip. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It needs to be a two-way dialogue ... among Egyptians themselves about the constitutional process and the substance of the constitution,\" Clinton told a news conference in Brussels. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Washington is worried about rising Islamist power in Egypt, a staunch U.S. security partner under Mubarak, who preserved the U.S.-brokered peace treaty Cairo signed with Israel in 1979. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Muslim Brotherhood had summoned supporters to an open-ended demonstration at the presidential palace, a day after about 10,000 opposition protesters had encircled it for what organisers dubbed a \"last warning\" to Mursi. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The people want the downfall of the regime,\" they chanted, roaring the signature slogan of last year's anti-Mubarak revolt. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The \"last warning\" may turn out to be one of the last gasps for a disparate opposition that has little chance of scuttling next week's vote on the draft constitution. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR State institutions, with the partial exception of the judiciary, have mostly fallen in behind Mursi. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The army, the muscle behind all previous Egyptian presidents in the republic's six-decade history, has gone back to barracks, having apparently lost its appetite to intervene in politics. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In a bold move, Mursi sacked Mohamed Hussein Tantawi, the Mubarak-era army commander and defence minister, in August and removed the sweeping powers that the military council, which took over after Mubarak fell, had grabbed two months earlier. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The liberals, leftists, Christians, ex-Mubarak followers and others opposed to Mursi have yet to generate a mass movement or a grassroots political base to challenge the Brotherhood. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Investors have seized on hopes that Egypt's turbulent transition, which has buffeted the economy for two years, may soon head for calmer waters, sending stocks 1.6 percent higher after a 3.5 percent rally on Tuesday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Egypt has turned to the IMF for a $4.8 billion loan after the depletion of its foreign currency reserves. The government said on Wednesday the process was on track and its request would go to the IMF board as expected. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The board is due to review the facility on Dec. 19. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Elijah Zarwan, a fellow with the European Council on Foreign Relations, said that if Egypt was to find a compromise solution to its crisis, it would not be through slogans and blows. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It will be through quiet negotiation, not through duelling press conferences, street brawls, or civil strife.\"\nPassage 3:\nCAIRO (Reuters) - Islamists battled with protesters outside Egyptian President Mohamed Mursi's palace on Thursday, after his vice president suggested amendments could be agreed to the draft constitution that has divided the nation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Fires burned in the streets near the palace perimeter where opponents and supporters of Mursi threw stones and petrol bombs. Riot police tried to separate the two sides, but failed to halt fighting that extended from Wednesday into the early morning. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Residents, frustrated that police had not calmed the streets, set up makeshift road blocks nearby to check passers-by, scenes reminiscent of the popular uprising that toppled Mursi's autocratic predecessor Hosni Mubarak. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Medical sources said 211 people were wounded, some with gunshot wounds. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"No to dictatorship,\" Mursi's opponents chanted, while their rivals chanted: \"Defending Mursi is defending Islam.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mursi's opponents accused him of creating a new autocracy by awarding himself extraordinary powers in a decree on November 22 and were further angered when an Islamist-dominated assembly pushed through a draft constitution that opponents said did not properly represent the aspirations of the whole nation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The United States, worried about the stability of a state that has a peace deal with Israel and to which it gives $1.3 billion in military aid each year, called for dialogue. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Bidding to end the worst crisis since Mursi took office less than six months ago, Vice President Mahmoud Mekky said amendments to disputed articles in the constitution could be agreed with the opposition. A written agreement could then go to parliament, to be elected after a referendum on the constitution on December 15. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"There must be consensus,\" he told a news conference inside the presidential palace as fighting raged outside on Wednesday evening, saying opposition demands had to be respected. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR PROTESTS SPREAD NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Prime Minister Hisham Kandil called for calm to \"give the opportunity\" for efforts underway to start a national dialogue. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Protests spread to other cities, and offices of the Muslim Brotherhood's political party in Ismailia and Suez were torched. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But Mursi has shown no sign of buckling under pressure from protestors, confident that the Islamists, who have dominated both elections since Mubarak was overthrown in February 2011, can win the referendum and parliamentary election to follow. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On top of the support of the Brotherhood, which backed him for the presidency in the June election, Mursi may also be able to rely on a popular yearning for stability and economic revival after almost two years of political turmoil. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Egypt's opposition coalition blamed Mursi for the violence and said it was ready for dialogue if the Islamist leader scrapped the decree that gave him wide powers and shielded his decisions from judicial review. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Today what is happening in the Egyptian street, polarization and division, is something that could and is actually drawing us to violence and could draw us to something worse,\" opposition coordinator Mohamed ElBaradei said on Wednesday.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But liberals, leftists, Christians, ex-Mubarak followers and others opposed to Mursi have yet to generate a mass movement or a grassroots base to challenge the Brotherhood. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'REAL DANGER' NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Opposition leaders have previously urged Mursi to retract the decree, defer the referendum and agree to revise the constitution, but have not echoed calls from street protesters for his overthrow and the \"downfall of the regime\". NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mursi has said his decree was needed to prevent courts still full of judges appointed by Mubarak from derailing a constitution vital for Egypt's political transition.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Clinton and Mursi worked together last month to broker a truce between Israel and Hamas Islamists in the Gaza Strip. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR British Foreign Secretary William Hague called for restraint on all sides. He said Egypt's authorities had to make progress on the transition in an \"inclusive manner\" and urged dialogue. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Both Islamists and their opponents have staged big shows of strength on the streets since Mursi's controversial decree, each bringing out tens of thousands of people. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR State institutions, with the partial exception of the judiciary, have mostly fallen in behind Mursi.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Egypt's opposition coalition blamed Mursi for the violence around his palace and said it was ready for dialogue if the Islamist leader scrapped a decree he issued on Nov. 22 that gave him wide powers and shielded his decisions from judicial review. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We hold President Mursi and his government completely responsible for the violence happening in Egypt today,\" opposition coordinator Mohamed ElBaradei told a news conference. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR POLARISATION NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We are ready for dialogue if the constitutional decree is cancelled ... and the referendum on this constitution is postponed,\" he said of the document written by an Islamist-led assembly that the opposition says ignores its concerns. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Today what is happening in the Egyptian street, polarisation and division, is something that could and is actually drawing us to violence and could draw us to something worse,\" the former head of the U.N. nuclear watchdog added. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Opposition leaders have previously urged Mursi to retract the Nov. 22 decree, defer the referendum and agree to revise the constitution, but have not echoed calls from street protesters for his overthrow and the \"downfall of the regime\". NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mursi has said his decree was needed to prevent courts still full of judges appointed by ousted strongman Hosni Mubarak from derailing a constitution vital for Egypt's political transition. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Rival groups skirmished outside the presidential palace earlier on Wednesday. Islamist supporters of Mursi tore down tents erected by leftist foes, who had begun a sit-in there. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"They hit us and destroyed our tents. Are you happy, Mursi? Aren't we Egyptians too?\" asked protester Haitham Ahmed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mohamed Mohy, a pro-Mursi demonstrator who was filming the scene, said: \"We are here to support our president and his decisions and save our country from traitors and agents.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mekky said street mobilisation by both sides posed a \"real danger\" to Egypt. \"If we do not put a stop to this phenomenon right away ... where are we headed? We must calm down.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton weighed into Egypt's political debate, saying dialogue was urgently needed on the new constitution, which should \"respect the rights of all citizens\". NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR DIALOGUE NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Clinton and Mursi worked together last month to broker a truce between Israel and Hamas Islamists in the Gaza Strip. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It needs to be a two-way dialogue ... among Egyptians themselves about the constitutional process and the substance of the constitution,\" Clinton told a news conference in Brussels. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Washington is worried about rising Islamist power in Egypt, a staunch U.S. security partner under Mubarak, who preserved the U.S.-brokered peace treaty Cairo signed with Israel in 1979. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Muslim Brotherhood had summoned supporters to an open-ended demonstration at the presidential palace, a day after about 10,000 opposition protesters had encircled it for what organisers dubbed a \"last warning\" to Mursi. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The people want the downfall of the regime,\" they chanted, roaring the signature slogan of last year's anti-Mubarak revolt. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The \"last warning\" may turn out to be one of the last gasps for a disparate opposition that has little chance of scuttling next week's vote on the draft constitution. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR State institutions, with the partial exception of the judiciary, have mostly fallen in behind Mursi. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The army, the muscle behind all previous Egyptian presidents in the republic's six-decade history, has gone back to barracks, having apparently lost its appetite to intervene in politics. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In a bold move, Mursi sacked Mohamed Hussein Tantawi, the Mubarak-era army commander and defence minister, in August and removed the sweeping powers that the military council, which took over after Mubarak fell, had grabbed two months earlier. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The liberals, leftists, Christians, ex-Mubarak followers and others opposed to Mursi have yet to generate a mass movement or a grassroots political base to challenge the Brotherhood. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Investors have seized on hopes that Egypt's turbulent transition, which has buffeted the economy for two years, may soon head for calmer waters, sending stocks 1.6 percent higher after a 3.5 percent rally on Tuesday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Egypt has turned to the IMF for a $4.8 billion loan after the depletion of its foreign currency reserves. The government said on Wednesday the process was on track and its request would go to the IMF board as expected. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The board is due to review the facility on Dec. 19. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Elijah Zarwan, a fellow with the European Council on Foreign Relations, said that if Egypt was to find a compromise solution to its crisis, it would not be through slogans and blows. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It will be through quiet negotiation, not through duelling press conferences, street brawls, or civil strife.\"\nPassage 3:\nCAIRO (Reuters) - Islamists battled with protesters outside Egyptian President Mohamed Mursi's palace on Thursday, after his vice president suggested amendments could be agreed to the draft constitution that has divided the nation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Fires burned in the streets near the palace perimeter where opponents and supporters of Mursi threw stones and petrol bombs. Riot police tried to separate the two sides, but failed to halt fighting that extended from Wednesday into the early morning. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Residents, frustrated that police had not calmed the streets, set up makeshift road blocks nearby to check passers-by, scenes reminiscent of the popular uprising that toppled Mursi's autocratic predecessor Hosni Mubarak. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Medical sources said 211 people were wounded, some with gunshot wounds. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"No to dictatorship,\" Mursi's opponents chanted, while their rivals chanted: \"Defending Mursi is defending Islam.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mursi's opponents accused him of creating a new autocracy by awarding himself extraordinary powers in a decree on November 22 and were further angered when an Islamist-dominated assembly pushed through a draft constitution that opponents said did not properly represent the aspirations of the whole nation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The United States, worried about the stability of a state that has a peace deal with Israel and to which it gives $1.3 billion in military aid each year, called for dialogue. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Bidding to end the worst crisis since Mursi took office less than six months ago, Vice President Mahmoud Mekky said amendments to disputed articles in the constitution could be agreed with the opposition. A written agreement could then go to parliament, to be elected after a referendum on the constitution on December 15. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"There must be consensus,\" he told a news conference inside the presidential palace as fighting raged outside on Wednesday evening, saying opposition demands had to be respected. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR PROTESTS SPREAD NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Prime Minister Hisham Kandil called for calm to \"give the opportunity\" for efforts underway to start a national dialogue. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Protests spread to other cities, and offices of the Muslim Brotherhood's political party in Ismailia and Suez were torched. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But Mursi has shown no sign of buckling under pressure from protestors, confident that the Islamists, who have dominated both elections since Mubarak was overthrown in February 2011, can win the referendum and parliamentary election to follow. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On top of the support of the Brotherhood, which backed him for the presidency in the June election, Mursi may also be able to rely on a popular yearning for stability and economic revival after almost two years of political turmoil. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Egypt's opposition coalition blamed Mursi for the violence and said it was ready for dialogue if the Islamist leader scrapped the decree that gave him wide powers and shielded his decisions from judicial review. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Today what is happening in the Egyptian street, polarization and division, is something that could and is actually drawing us to violence and could draw us to something worse,\" opposition coordinator Mohamed ElBaradei said on Wednesday.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR British Foreign Secretary William Hague called for restraint on all sides. He said Egypt's authorities had to make progress on the transition in an \"inclusive manner\" and urged dialogue. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Both Islamists and their opponents have staged big shows of strength on the streets since Mursi's controversial decree, each bringing out tens of thousands of people.

{"prompt": "You are given several news passages. Write a one-page summary of all news. \n\nNews:\nPassage 1:\nBERLIN (AP) \u2014 German prosecutors said Wednesday they have indicted two former Nazi SS guards in their 90s on charges of being accessories to murder while they worked at a World War II concentration camp. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Both men served as guards at the Stutthof concentration camp, located near what is now the Polish city of Gdansk, Dortmund prosecutor Andreas Brendel told The Associated Press. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The indictments were filed against a 93-year-old man from Borken who served in Stutthof from June 1942 to September 1944 and a 92-year-old man from Wuppertal who was there from June 1944 to May 1945. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The charges were filed last week at the state court in Muenster but only announced Wednesday because the defendants first had to be notified. Both deny they had any knowledge of killings at the camp, Brendel said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR About 65,000 people died at Stutthof. Some were put to death in gas chambers or shot, while others died from malnutrition or froze to death. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The men, who have not been named, both served as guards and also watched over prisoners who were taken outside the camp to work. During the time they were at Stutthof, hundreds of killings occurred. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Members of the SS killed more than 100 Polish prisoners and some 77 Soviet prisoners of war in the camp's gas chamber in 1944. An unknown number of Jews also were gassed there in late 1944. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Between June 1944 and April 1945, SS members also killed several hundred Jews by shooting them in the back of the neck. SS-physicians and nurses at Stutthof killed more than 140 prisoners, many of them Jewish women and children, by injecting their hearts with gasoline and the chemical compound phenol from late 1942 until late 1944. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The prosecutors assume that the accused were aware of the different killing methods ...and that such a multitude of people could have only been killed with such regularity because the victims were guarded by helpers like them,\" the court wrote in a statement issued Wednesday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The two men therefore willingly supported several hundreds of killings of camp inmates in their function as guards, the statement added. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR German prosecutors in recent years have pursued Nazi suspects under new legal reasoning that, even without evidence of a specific crime, they can be prosecuted if they helped camps operate.\nPassage 2:\nIn Judith Meisel\u2019s last image of her mother, Mina, she is standing outside a gas chamber at the Stutthof concentration camp in Poland, awaiting the same fate that befell 65,000 other prisoners there. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This summer, as she has countless times before, the St. Louis Park resident relived the experience in wrenching detail, but this time for a set of German prosecutors who, aided by Minnesota FBI agents, were racing to bring to justice the few Nazis still alive who can be linked to World War II-era atrocities. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Now Meisel, 88, knows her assistance paid off: German authorities this month indicted two ex-guards on charges of being accessories to many of the murders at Stutthof, located near what is now the Polish city of Gdansk. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Under German law, Meisel could join prosecutors as a \u201cco-plaintiff\u201d in the case. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In June, Meisel stunned the Germans, and her family, when she identified one of the ex-guards, Johann Rehbogen, as a teenage SS officer who taunted her and other female prisoners as they undressed each morning. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The charges, made possible by new German legal guidance allowing the prosecution of former Nazis who can\u2019t be tied to specific killings, represent a new and vital chapter for survivors like Meisel. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Holocaust survivor Judy Meisel held a photo of her parents Osser Beker and Mika Beker that was taken around 1938. Judy's mother died in the gas chamber at Stutthof concentration camp on the Baltic coast in late 1944 or early 1945. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cI understand that the person who has been indicted was a young man at the time,\u201d Meisel said. \u201cStill, the questions he must answer are an important part of this story.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR How, for example, did he take such a gruesome job at such a young age? What did he think when he watched women and children being killed on an industrial scale? How has he explained his past to his family and friends? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Meisel awaits any details the 94-year-old Rehbogen can provide, even if it means she must again relive the horror of her years inside the camp. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cThis process of seeking answers and finding justice for my mother gives new meaning to my life,\u201d Meisel said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR What comes next? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Prosecutors in Dortmund indicted Rehbogen and Harry Paul Fritz Schulz, 92, on charges stemming from their tenures at the camp from 1942 to 1944. Since 2011, German authorities have been pursuing cases against Nazis whom they believe they can prove helped operate concentration camps during the war. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A Dortmund prosecutor told the Associated Press this month that both men denied knowing anything about the killings at the camp. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Meisel\u2019s description of life in the camp \u2014 and law enforcement interviews with other Americans identified as Stutthof survivors \u2014 are essential for prosecutors to challenge those denials. In June, Meisel instantly recognized a photo of Rehbogen, whom she and other prisoners called \u201cMeydele\u201d for his girlish looks, and said he was among those who taunted and beat prisoners. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cornelius Nestler, a German professor and lawyer who has represented Holocaust survivors in similar cases, found Meisel online and connected her with German authorities who weren\u2019t sure how many, if any, Stutthof survivors were still alive. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Nestler told the Star Tribune in an e-mail that the defendants will have an opportunity to challenge the indictment and will likely be evaluated by medical experts for their fitness to stand trial. Nestler said that the trial could commence next summer if the defendants are deemed healthy enough. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Meisel, he said, could \u201ctake the stand as a witness,\u201d or at least observe the proceedings. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u2018Important lessons\u2019 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Meisel\u2019s son, Michael Cohen, said he\u2019s not sure if his mother would travel to Germany or participate in the prosecution from afar. German authorities also named witnesses from Ohio, New Jersey, New York and Florida. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The charges came as a surprise to the family, Cohen said, and represented a determination not to \u201csimply move aside and forget about\u201d those responsible. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cohen, a Minneapolis attorney, said news of the charges brought back new, vivid memories for his mother that include witnessing camp inmates killed by injections administered by Stutthof doctors. Meisel has since spent much of the month thinking of her mother and sister Rachel, who was forced on a death march away from the camp with her in early 1945 that they both escaped. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cohen said Meisel has described her mother as a woman of forgiveness, but is still unsure how she would respond to the charges. \u201cShe\u2019s very interested in what comes next,\u201d Cohen said this week. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He also said the wave of emotions has taken its toll on his mother. As an activist, she has told her story to audiences across the country, but in the days since learning of the indictments, Meisel has privately revisited what it meant to be a Stutthof inmate. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While she still has nightmares, Meisel said she welcomes any chance to tell her story \u201cfor the important lessons it teaches about tolerance and racism.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She said she cannot forget the message from some of her fellow prisoners: \u201cDon\u2019t let us die without you mentioning what happened to us.\u201d\n\n\nNow, write a one-page summary of all the news.\n\nSummary:", "input": "", "context": "Passage 1:\nBERLIN (AP) \u2014 German prosecutors said Wednesday they have indicted two former Nazi SS guards in their 90s on charges of being accessories to murder while they worked at a World War II concentration camp.

SS-physicians and nurses at Stutthof killed more than 140 prisoners, many of them Jewish women and children, by injecting their hearts with gasoline and the chemical compound phenol from late 1942 until late 1944. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The prosecutors assume that the accused were aware of the different killing methods ...and that such a multitude of people could have only been killed with such regularity because the victims were guarded by helpers like them,\" the court wrote in a statement issued Wednesday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The two men therefore willingly supported several hundreds of killings of camp inmates in their function as guards, the statement added. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR German prosecutors in recent years have pursued Nazi suspects under new legal reasoning that, even without evidence of a specific crime, they can be prosecuted if they helped camps operate.\nPassage 2:\nIn Judith Meisel\u2019s last image of her mother, Mina, she is standing outside a gas chamber at the Stutthof concentration camp in Poland, awaiting the same fate that befell 65,000 other prisoners there. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This summer, as she has countless times before, the St. Louis Park resident relived the experience in wrenching detail, but this time for a set of German prosecutors who, aided by Minnesota FBI agents, were racing to bring to justice the few Nazis still alive who can be linked to World War II-era atrocities. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Now Meisel, 88, knows her assistance paid off: German authorities this month indicted two ex-guards on charges of being accessories to many of the murders at Stutthof, located near what is now the Polish city of Gdansk. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Under German law, Meisel could join prosecutors as a \u201cco-plaintiff\u201d in the case. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In June, Meisel stunned the Germans, and her family, when she identified one of the ex-guards, Johann Rehbogen, as a teenage SS officer who taunted her and other female prisoners as they undressed each morning. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The charges, made possible by new German legal guidance allowing the prosecution of former Nazis who can\u2019t be tied to specific killings, represent a new and vital chapter for survivors like Meisel. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Holocaust survivor Judy Meisel held a photo of her parents Osser Beker and Mika Beker that was taken around 1938. Judy's mother died in the gas chamber at Stutthof concentration camp on the Baltic coast in late 1944 or early 1945. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cI understand that the person who has been indicted was a young man at the time,\u201d Meisel said. \u201cStill, the questions he must answer are an important part of this story.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR How, for example, did he take such a gruesome job at such a young age? What did he think when he watched women and children being killed on an industrial scale? How has he explained his past to his family and friends? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Meisel awaits any details the 94-year-old Rehbogen can provide, even if it means she must again relive the horror of her years inside the camp. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cThis process of seeking answers and finding justice for my mother gives new meaning to my life,\u201d Meisel said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR What comes next? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Prosecutors in Dortmund indicted Rehbogen and Harry Paul Fritz Schulz, 92, on charges stemming from their tenures at the camp from 1942 to 1944. Since 2011, German authorities have been pursuing cases against Nazis whom they believe they can prove helped operate concentration camps during the war. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A Dortmund prosecutor told the Associated Press this month that both men denied knowing anything about the killings at the camp. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Meisel\u2019s description of life in the camp \u2014 and law enforcement interviews with other Americans identified as Stutthof survivors \u2014 are essential for prosecutors to challenge those denials. In June, Meisel instantly recognized a photo of Rehbogen, whom she and other prisoners called \u201cMeydele\u201d for his girlish looks, and said he was among those who taunted and beat prisoners. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cornelius Nestler, a German professor and lawyer who has represented Holocaust survivors in similar cases, found Meisel online and connected her with German authorities who weren\u2019t sure how many, if any, Stutthof survivors were still alive. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Nestler told the Star Tribune in an e-mail that the defendants will have an opportunity to challenge the indictment and will likely be evaluated by medical experts for their fitness to stand trial. Nestler said that the trial could commence next summer if the defendants are deemed healthy enough. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Meisel, he said, could \u201ctake the stand as a witness,\u201d or at least observe the proceedings. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u2018Important lessons\u2019 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Meisel\u2019s son, Michael Cohen, said he\u2019s not sure if his mother would travel to Germany or participate in the prosecution from afar. German authorities also named witnesses from Ohio, New Jersey, New York and Florida. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The charges came as a surprise to the family, Cohen said, and represented a determination not to \u201csimply move aside and forget about\u201d those responsible. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cohen, a Minneapolis attorney, said news of the charges brought back new, vivid memories for his mother that include witnessing camp inmates killed by injections administered by Stutthof doctors. Meisel has since spent much of the month thinking of her mother and sister Rachel, who was forced on a death march away from the camp with her in early 1945 that they both escaped. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cohen said Meisel has described her mother as a woman of forgiveness, but is still unsure how she would respond to the charges. \u201cShe\u2019s very interested in what comes next,\u201d Cohen said this week. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He also said the wave of emotions has taken its toll on his mother. As an activist, she has told her story to audiences across the country, but in the days since learning of the indictments, Meisel has privately revisited what it meant to be a Stutthof inmate. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While she still has nightmares, Meisel said she welcomes any chance to tell her story \u201cfor the important lessons it teaches about tolerance and racism.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She said she cannot forget the message from some of her fellow prisoners: \u201cDon\u2019t let us die without you mentioning what happened to us.\u201d\n", "answers": ["Judith Meisel says that when she was a teenager in the Stutthof concentration camp in western Poland, other prisoners told her: \"Don't let us die without you mentioning what happened to us.\" The 88-year-old Minnesota resident has not forgotten: Her testimony helped German authorities indict two former guards from the camp where 65,000 people, including Meisel's mother, died, the Minneapolis Star Tribune reports. She identified one former guard, 94-year-old Johann Rehbogen, as the young SS officer who would taunt female prisoners as they undressed. Prosecutors say the men can't be tied to specific murders, but their work as guards made the killings possible. Meisel\u2014who escaped along with her sister when inmates were sent on a \"death march\" away from the camp in 1945\u2014says she is willing to relive her horrific experiences to help prosecutors. \"This process of seeking answers and finding justice for my mother gives new meaning to my life,\" she says. The two former guards have been charged as accessories to murder, the AP reports. They deny any knowledge of killings at the camp, where thousands were starved to death or froze. Prosecutors say prisoners were also gassed to death, shot, and killed with lethal injections. Authorities say Meisel and several other Stutthof survivors in the US could be called as witnesses if the former guards are deemed healthy enough to stand trial.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR With those desert plateaus once again under siege, this time by the armies of the Libyan leader, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, about 30,000 Libyans have repeated their ancestors\u2019 flight. Astonishingly, to aid workers, hundreds upon hundreds of Tunisians, some of them the descendants of those earlier refugees, have opened their homes to these Libyan families since early April, when Colonel Qaddafi\u2019s forces went on the attack. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There are no sprawling refugee camps at the border, just two modest clusters of tents housing around 2,500 people. The vast majority of the newcomers are now living with Tunisian families here and in neighboring villages, an area that in normal times counts just 150,000 residents. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cIt\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve seen such an impressive response,\u201d said Firas Kayal, a spokesman in Tunisia for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. That generosity is all the more remarkable, he added, given the challenges Tunisia faces in the wake of its own revolution \u2014 which in January ended 23 years of kleptocratic rule by President Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali \u2014 and previous waves of Libyan refugees this year in the north. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Even some of the refugees seem baffled by it.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cWe don\u2019t even know how to thank them for something like this,\u201d Ms. Abouzakhar said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Abdallah Awaye, 35, a thin, sun-darkened man and the owner of the house, described his gesture as a matter of obligation and pride. \u201cThis is how it is, these are our customs,\u201d he said. \u201cIf there is something to eat, we will eat it together. If there is nothing to eat, we will have nothing together.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Most of the refugees arrived at the border with little more than the clothes on their backs and fears for the sons they left behind to fight the Qaddafi militias, and were rapidly taken in by local residents whose compassion and good cheer have drawn the admiration of Libyans and international aid workers alike. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mr. Kayal also praised the generosity of the Tunisian government, which has kept the country\u2019s borders open from the start of the Libyan conflict. As many 276,000 people \u2014 most of them foreign workers \u2014 have fled Libya for Tunisia, according to United Nations estimates.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Despite the abundance of good intentions, though, the city and surrounding areas are feeling the strain of so many refugees. The afterglow of January\u2019s jubilant revolution has largely given way to old frustrations, with people complaining of a stagnant economy, inadequate infrastructure and widespread unemployment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The police, the lackeys of the deposed government, are largely absent from the streets, having gone into hiding after the revolution.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Three local coordinating centers have been opened, placing Libyan families in homes and distributing donated couscous, macaroni, milk and tomatoes, as well as mattresses and blankets.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The struggle between forces loyal to Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi and rebels trying to end his more than four decades of rule drew in outsiders last month, as NATO began air strikes on government troops under a United Nations mandate. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But on Thursday the fighting spilled over Libya's land frontier, when Gaddafi troops battled rebels on Tunisian territory for control of the Dehiba-Wazin frontier crossing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The incursion was brief and limited, and Gaddafi's troops even apologized locally. But the response was nevertheless furious from Tunisia, where the Arab world's wave of uprisings began late last year, leading to the overthrow of President Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali in January. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Given the gravity of what has happened ... the Tunisian authorities have informed the Libyans of their extreme indignation and demand measures to put an immediate stop to these violations,\" a Tunisian Foreign Ministry statement said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Illustrating the difficulty of keeping the Libyan conflict sealed within the country's land borders, artillery shells fired by Gaddafi forces also struck the Tunisian side of the crossing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Rebels seized the post a week ago, as it controls the only road link which their comrades in Libya's Western Mountains have with the outside world, making them rely otherwise on rough tracks for supplies of food, fuel and medicine. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After weeks of advances and retreats by rebel and government forces along the Mediterranean coast, fighting has settled into a pattern of clashes and skirmishes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Thursday's battle for the crossing between Dehiba in Tunisia and Wazin on the Libyan side was typical of the fluid and confused conflict, which broke out in mid-February. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR First government troops stormed the post in what appeared to be part of a broader offensive to root out rebel outposts beyond their eastern heartland around Benghazi, Libya's second city. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Gaddafi's soldiers apologized to their Tunisian counterparts for the incursion and hoisted their flag at the border, tearing down a pre-Gaddafi era flag that had fluttered for a few days. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But then the rebels, who had retreated into Tunisia, counter-attacked and as the fog of war descended, rumors spread that the post was back in their hands. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the confusion, scores of vehicles headed for the border from the Tunisian side with civilians on board shouting \"We've won! We've won!\" but they swiftly turned back when they found Gaddafi's forces were still there. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR MISRATA'S PLIGHT DEEPENS NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the port city of Misrata, the rebels' biggest enclave in western Libya, the plight of residents worsened.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR With those desert plateaus once again under siege, this time by the armies of the Libyan leader, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, about 30,000 Libyans have repeated their ancestors\u2019 flight. Astonishingly, to aid workers, hundreds upon hundreds of Tunisians, some of them the descendants of those earlier refugees, have opened their homes to these Libyan families since early April, when Colonel Qaddafi\u2019s forces went on the attack. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There are no sprawling refugee camps at the border, just two modest clusters of tents housing around 2,500 people. The vast majority of the newcomers are now living with Tunisian families here and in neighboring villages, an area that in normal times counts just 150,000 residents. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cIt\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve seen such an impressive response,\u201d said Firas Kayal, a spokesman in Tunisia for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. That generosity is all the more remarkable, he added, given the challenges Tunisia faces in the wake of its own revolution \u2014 which in January ended 23 years of kleptocratic rule by President Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali \u2014 and previous waves of Libyan refugees this year in the north. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Even some of the refugees seem baffled by it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cWould you give your house to someone you didn\u2019t know, from another country?\u201d asked Maren Abouzakhar, 22, who fled the besieged Libyan city of Yafran early this month. She spoke in the airy drawing room of the house she and 10 relatives now shared with a local family; the owner had moved himself, his wife and their three children into the unfinished ground floor, leaving the comfortable, perfumed second story for their guests. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cWe don\u2019t even know how to thank them for something like this,\u201d Ms. Abouzakhar said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Abdallah Awaye, 35, a thin, sun-darkened man and the owner of the house, described his gesture as a matter of obligation and pride. \u201cThis is how it is, these are our customs,\u201d he said. \u201cIf there is something to eat, we will eat it together. If there is nothing to eat, we will have nothing together.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Most of the refugees arrived at the border with little more than the clothes on their backs and fears for the sons they left behind to fight the Qaddafi militias, and were rapidly taken in by local residents whose compassion and good cheer have drawn the admiration of Libyans and international aid workers alike. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mr. Kayal also praised the generosity of the Tunisian government, which has kept the country\u2019s borders open from the start of the Libyan conflict. As many 276,000 people \u2014 most of them foreign workers \u2014 have fled Libya for Tunisia, according to United Nations estimates. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Asked about their willingness to provide shelter to strangers, residents of Tataouine like to cite an apt local proverb: Travelers cry upon arriving in this desolate place, but leave with tears in their eyes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Despite the abundance of good intentions, though, the city and surrounding areas are feeling the strain of so many refugees. The afterglow of January\u2019s jubilant revolution has largely given way to old frustrations, with people complaining of a stagnant economy, inadequate infrastructure and widespread unemployment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The police, the lackeys of the deposed government, are largely absent from the streets, having gone into hiding after the revolution. And many worry that the country\u2019s transitional government has failed to break with what they call decades of neglect for the arid Tunisian south. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cGenerosity and fraternity have been taking precedence over the problems,\u201d said Ali Mourou, the mayor of Tataouine. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Nevertheless, he said, in response to appeals from the city, truckloads of aid have flowed in from as far as Tunis, the capital, 300 miles to the north. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Three local coordinating centers have been opened, placing Libyan families in homes and distributing donated couscous, macaroni, milk and tomatoes, as well as mattresses and blankets. Libyan children have been placed in local schools, and doctors and nurses have opened a clinic offering free medical care. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cWe\u2019ve taken the thing as a human obligation, a religious obligation, an obligation of fraternity,\u201d Mr. Mourou said, and the Libyans have been \u201ctruly appreciative.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He added, \u201cThey ought to be.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He worries, though.\nPassage 2:\nTRIPOLI/TUNIS Libya's two-month civil war spilled over the border into Tunisia, provoking outrage in the western neighbor, while rebels in Misrata said only NATO could halt the bombardment of the besieged city. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The struggle between forces loyal to Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi and rebels trying to end his more than four decades of rule drew in outsiders last month, as NATO began air strikes on government troops under a United Nations mandate. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But on Thursday the fighting spilled over Libya's land frontier, when Gaddafi troops battled rebels on Tunisian territory for control of the Dehiba-Wazin frontier crossing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The incursion was brief and limited, and Gaddafi's troops even apologized locally. But the response was nevertheless furious from Tunisia, where the Arab world's wave of uprisings began late last year, leading to the overthrow of President Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali in January. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Given the gravity of what has happened ... the Tunisian authorities have informed the Libyans of their extreme indignation and demand measures to put an immediate stop to these violations,\" a Tunisian Foreign Ministry statement said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Illustrating the difficulty of keeping the Libyan conflict sealed within the country's land borders, artillery shells fired by Gaddafi forces also struck the Tunisian side of the crossing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Rebels seized the post a week ago, as it controls the only road link which their comrades in Libya's Western Mountains have with the outside world, making them rely otherwise on rough tracks for supplies of food, fuel and medicine. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After weeks of advances and retreats by rebel and government forces along the Mediterranean coast, fighting has settled into a pattern of clashes and skirmishes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Thursday's battle for the crossing between Dehiba in Tunisia and Wazin on the Libyan side was typical of the fluid and confused conflict, which broke out in mid-February. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR First government troops stormed the post in what appeared to be part of a broader offensive to root out rebel outposts beyond their eastern heartland around Benghazi, Libya's second city. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Gaddafi's soldiers apologized to their Tunisian counterparts for the incursion and hoisted their flag at the border, tearing down a pre-Gaddafi era flag that had fluttered for a few days. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But then the rebels, who had retreated into Tunisia, counter-attacked and as the fog of war descended, rumors spread that the post was back in their hands. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the confusion, scores of vehicles headed for the border from the Tunisian side with civilians on board shouting \"We've won! We've won!\" but they swiftly turned back when they found Gaddafi's forces were still there. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR MISRATA'S PLIGHT DEEPENS NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the port city of Misrata, the rebels' biggest enclave in western Libya, the plight of residents worsened. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Rebels accused Gaddafi's forces of firing bigger rockets than the Russian-made Grad missiles largely used until now. A rebel called Marwan said in an audio statement on YouTube that the bigger rockets cause much greater destruction. \"Gaddafi the tyrant is trying to wipe out the city of Misrata,\" he said.

He was also one of the early 20th century\u2019s notable philanthropists.... The richness of primary evidence continually delights.\" \u2014Judith Sealander, author of Private Wealth and Public Life NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"[No] mere philanthropist [but a] subtle, stinging critic of our racial democracy.\" \u2014W. E. B. DuBois on Julius Rosenwald NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In this richly revealing biography of a major, but little-known, American businessman and philanthropist, Peter Ascoli brings to life a portrait of Julius Rosenwald, the man and his work. The son of first-generation German Jewish immigrants, Julius Rosenwald, known to his friends as \"JR,\" apprenticed for his uncles, who were major clothing manufacturers in New York City. It would be as a men\u2019s clothing salesperson that JR would make his fateful encounter with Sears, Roebuck and Company, which he eventually fashioned into the greatest mail order firm in the world. He also founded Chicago\u2019s Museum of Science and Industry. And in the American South Rosenwald helped support the building of the more than 5,300 schools that bore his name. Yet the charitable fund he created during World War I went out of existence in 1948 at his expressed wish. Ascoli provides a fascinating account of Rosenwald\u2019s meteoric rise in American business, but he also portrays a man devoted to family and with a desire to help his community that led to a lifelong devotion to philanthropy. He tells about Rosenwald\u2019s important philanthropic activities, especially those connected with the Rosenwald schools and Booker T. Washington, and later through the Rosenwald Fund. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ascoli\u2019s account of Rosenwald is an inspiring story of hard work and success, and of giving back to the nation in which he prospered.\nPassage 2:\nPHILADELPHIA (JTA) \u2014 Alex Bethea, the son of cotton and tobacco farm workers, was in sixth grade in 1965 when his family moved from Dillon, South Carolina, to the tiny town of Fairmont, North Carolina, where he attended a school called Rosenwald. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But it wasn\u2019t until this week, 50 years later, that Bethea learned that his school was named for Julius Rosenwald, the Jewish philanthropist who is the subject of a new documentary by Aviva Kempner. The film tells the little-known story of Rosenwald\u2019s contribution to African-American culture and education. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The revelation came at a July 14 session at the national convention of the NAACP, which drew several thousand delegates to Philadelphia.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Rosenwald, who made his fortune at the helm of Sears, Roebuck and Co., also provided seed money to build YMCAs for blacks in cities around the country. In addition, he developed a huge apartment complex in Chicago to help improve the living conditions for the masses who had migrated from the Jim Crow South. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cIt\u2019s a wonderful story of cooperation between this philanthropist who did not have to care about black people, but who did, and who expended his considerable wealth in ensuring that they got their fair shake in America,\u201d Julian Bond, the renowned civil rights leader, says in the documentary. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kempner told JTA that her new film on Rosenwald \u201ccelebrates the affinity between African-Americans and Jews\u201d that started long before the civil rights movement and speaks to the powerful Jewish tradition of tikkun olam, or repairing the world. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kempner joined Bond and Rabbi David Saperstein, the former head of the Reform movement\u2019s Religious Action Center who now serves as U.S. ambassador at large for International Religious Freedom, for a discussion after the screening at the NAACP conference.

E. B.

The son of first-generation German Jewish immigrants, Julius Rosenwald, known to his friends as \"JR,\" apprenticed for his uncles, who were major clothing manufacturers in New York City. It would be as a men\u2019s clothing salesperson that JR would make his fateful encounter with Sears, Roebuck and Company, which he eventually fashioned into the greatest mail order firm in the world. He also founded Chicago\u2019s Museum of Science and Industry. And in the American South Rosenwald helped support the building of the more than 5,300 schools that bore his name. Yet the charitable fund he created during World War I went out of existence in 1948 at his expressed wish. Ascoli provides a fascinating account of Rosenwald\u2019s meteoric rise in American business, but he also portrays a man devoted to family and with a desire to help his community that led to a lifelong devotion to philanthropy. He tells about Rosenwald\u2019s important philanthropic activities, especially those connected with the Rosenwald schools and Booker T. Washington, and later through the Rosenwald Fund.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Update: This story has been updated to include comment from Spin Master\nPassage 4:\nFRESNO, Calif. (CN) \u2013 A federal class action claims that Hatchimals, the nationwide toy craze that hatches from an egg, don\u2019t always hatch, producing unhappiness in families that the filing attorney says can range from \u201cextreme disappointment to tragic.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Hatchimals are stuffed animals that hatch out of the colored spotted eggs they are sold in. The creature inside is a mystery, making kids excited to see what they may get. The hatching is the toy\u2019s signature attraction, according to the Jan. 19 lawsuit against Spin Master Corp. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Spin Master released the toys in early October 2016, in time for the holidays, and they quickly became the year\u2019s must-have gift. By November they were hard to find. Some parents waited for hours outside toy stores; others paid up to seven times the retail price eBay and other internet sites. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Hatchimals typically sold for $50 to $60. They were advertised Monday morning for $79.99 on the Toys Are U website, and for $59.99 on the Wal-Mart website, which, however, was out of stock. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Spin Master made an estimated $100 million in profits off the toy, attorney Ben Meiselas said in an interview, but investigations indicate that its failure rate is exceptionally high. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cThis was an aggressive and brilliant marketing campaign built on a house of cards and lies for a product that was not ready for the market,\u201d Meiselas said. \u201cSpin Master knew it was spinning consumers; they knew the product didn\u2019t hatch.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He noted the irony of the company\u2019s name: Spin Master. Stories told by families who bought the toy \u201cborder on extreme disappointment to tragic, depending on different families\u2019 situations and their ability to purchase these expensive items,\u201d said Meiselas, of Geragos & Geragos in Los Angeles. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cThey were playing on the most visceral emotions of a family: a child\u2019s happiness. It exceeds a mere letdown and caused real damages.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Many consumers who tried to solve the problem by contacting Spin Master hit a brick wall, as customer service never returned their calls or messages, \u201cwith some customers reporting being on hold for as long as three hours before having their call disconnected,\u201d the complaint states, citing a Dec. 28 article in Global News. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Lead plaintiff Jodie Hejduk seeks to represent both a California class and a national class, though Meiselas says his office has been getting calls from people around the world. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cWe want Spin Master to stop the spin, be a responsible corporate citizen, and redress the damages to consumers, or it\u2019s headed to a jury of moms and dads, husbands and wives, who will decide whether the product was fraudulent. We think they will,\u201d Meiselas said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He said he hopes the class action sends a message to other corporations \u201clooking to exploit the average consumer saving money to buy their kids a gift not to sell a defective product that hits Americans in the pocketbook.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Hejduk, who snagged one of the coveted toys for her daughter\u2019s birthday, says her daughter was thrilled to get it, but \u201cdismayed\u201d when it never hatched, though she followed the instructions. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Other parents have written scathing reviews on Amazon.com and on the Toys R Us website. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Spin Master promised to address the issues, but the few remedial measures it took were ineffective, according to the 25-page complaint. Hejduk says the company should have recalled the toys or issued refunds, but it did neither. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Spin Master did not return emailed requests for comment on Friday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Hejduk seeks class certification, a recall, restitution with interest, and compensatory, statutory and punitive damages for consumer law violations, unfair competition, false advertising, breach of warranty and unjust enrichment.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Update: This story has been updated to include comment from Spin Master\nPassage 4:\nFRESNO, Calif. (CN) \u2013 A federal class action claims that Hatchimals, the nationwide toy craze that hatches from an egg, don\u2019t always hatch, producing unhappiness in families that the filing attorney says can range from \u201cextreme disappointment to tragic.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Hatchimals are stuffed animals that hatch out of the colored spotted eggs they are sold in. The creature inside is a mystery, making kids excited to see what they may get. The hatching is the toy\u2019s signature attraction, according to the Jan. 19 lawsuit against Spin Master Corp. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Spin Master released the toys in early October 2016, in time for the holidays, and they quickly became the year\u2019s must-have gift. By November they were hard to find. Some parents waited for hours outside toy stores; others paid up to seven times the retail price eBay and other internet sites. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Hatchimals typically sold for $50 to $60. They were advertised Monday morning for $79.99 on the Toys Are U website, and for $59.99 on the Wal-Mart website, which, however, was out of stock. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Spin Master made an estimated $100 million in profits off the toy, attorney Ben Meiselas said in an interview, but investigations indicate that its failure rate is exceptionally high. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cThis was an aggressive and brilliant marketing campaign built on a house of cards and lies for a product that was not ready for the market,\u201d Meiselas said. \u201cSpin Master knew it was spinning consumers; they knew the product didn\u2019t hatch.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He noted the irony of the company\u2019s name: Spin Master. Stories told by families who bought the toy \u201cborder on extreme disappointment to tragic, depending on different families\u2019 situations and their ability to purchase these expensive items,\u201d said Meiselas, of Geragos & Geragos in Los Angeles. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cThey were playing on the most visceral emotions of a family: a child\u2019s happiness. It exceeds a mere letdown and caused real damages.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Many consumers who tried to solve the problem by contacting Spin Master hit a brick wall, as customer service never returned their calls or messages, \u201cwith some customers reporting being on hold for as long as three hours before having their call disconnected,\u201d the complaint states, citing a Dec. 28 article in Global News. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Lead plaintiff Jodie Hejduk seeks to represent both a California class and a national class, though Meiselas says his office has been getting calls from people around the world. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cWe want Spin Master to stop the spin, be a responsible corporate citizen, and redress the damages to consumers, or it\u2019s headed to a jury of moms and dads, husbands and wives, who will decide whether the product was fraudulent. We think they will,\u201d Meiselas said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He said he hopes the class action sends a message to other corporations \u201clooking to exploit the average consumer saving money to buy their kids a gift not to sell a defective product that hits Americans in the pocketbook.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Hejduk, who snagged one of the coveted toys for her daughter\u2019s birthday, says her daughter was thrilled to get it, but \u201cdismayed\u201d when it never hatched, though she followed the instructions. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Other parents have written scathing reviews on Amazon.com and on the Toys R Us website. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Spin Master promised to address the issues, but the few remedial measures it took were ineffective, according to the 25-page complaint. Hejduk says the company should have recalled the toys or issued refunds, but it did neither. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Spin Master did not return emailed requests for comment on Friday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Hejduk seeks class certification, a recall, restitution with interest, and compensatory, statutory and punitive damages for consumer law violations, unfair competition, false advertising, breach of warranty and unjust enrichment.

The lawsuit, filed by Jodie Hejduk of Bakersfield, Calif., on behalf of what the suit says could be millions of consumers, claims Spin Master ran \"a bait-and-switch marketing scheme.\" Hatchimals are plush animals stuffed into plastic eggs that, when the egg is rubbed and cuddled for about half an hour, should begin to peck their way out.

One customer wrote on Amazon.com that she \"watched every YouTube video we could for help, but to no avail,\" the lawsuit says, per NBC News. Others complained that calling Spin Master had done no good because the company was \"impossible to contact,\" or that when they got through they were told to open the egg themselves. Spin Master blames the toy's popularity, saying the company \"experienced a higher than anticipated number of calls\" over the holidays, and that the lawsuit's allegations are \"not based on actual facts.\" But an attorney on the case tells Courthouse News that the toy's failure rate is \"exceptionally high,\" and that the company knew the product wasn't ready for market.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In its report, the team also concluded that while the site where the wreck was found \"is located in the general area where one would expect to find the Santa Maria based on contemporary accounts of Columbus's first voyage, it is further away from shore than one should expect\".

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The wreck of the Santa Maria was never found.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Unesco \u2013 which has now examined Clifford\u2019s wreck \u2013 believes that it is not the Santa Maria, but that the real final resting place of Columbus' flagship could be relatively nearby. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Paris-based organization now plans to look for the Santa Maria in a number of different locations \u2013 some on land and others on the seabed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Both the nature of Unesco\u2019s outright rejection of Clifford\u2019s site, and some of the organisation\u2019s proposed alternatives, are likely to prove controversial. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR An official Unesco report issued today largely ignores 11-year-old photographic evidence for what could be Columbus-era cannon on the site. The cannon have tragically been looted since the photographs were taken but some of the world\u2019s top experts in early ordnance who have looked at the photos believe that they are 15th or 16th century weapons, sometimes known as lombards. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The report also ignores crucial evidence from an expedition which almost certainly visited the site in 1960. It also admits that no tests, which could have revealed the geographical origin of the vessel, have been carried out on the ballast from the wreck. Likewise no detailed analysis has been carried out on the bronze objects found on the site \u2013 tests which might have revealed the objects\u2019 ages. Neither does the report really assess in any detail the case for there potentially being two wrecks, one early and one later, on the site, rather than just one. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The bronze items \u2013 a number of ship construction fasteners \u2013 is the main reason for rejecting it as the Santa Maria. Unesco says that ship construction fasteners only came into use in the late 17th century, a belief based mainly on the fact that such fasteners have apparently not been found so far on earlier wrecks. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Very significantly, Unesco also seems to have moved towards the belief that the Santa Maria may be buried under sediments on what used to be seabed and is now coastal marshland. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Many scholars are likely to be very critical of any plan Unesco has to look for the Santa Maria in those marshes, because, they argue, Columbus's vessel could not have reached them due to some shallow and dangerous reefs. Unesco\u2019s only argument for looking on land, and one of only two arguments for rejecting Mr Clifford\u2019s site, is a short very ambiguous passage in an edited version of Columbus\u2019 diary.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The United States has refused to pay its set financial contribution to Unesco for the past three years \u2013 and last year the organisation stripped America of its Unesco voting rights. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Santa Maria saga could potentially further damage relations, or at least public attitudes, because a senior US underwater archaeologist, Professor Charles Beeker of Indiana University, who had been conducting a preliminary investigation of the site earlier this year at the request of Barry Clifford, has been refused permission to continue his work. What was in effect a US-led investigation has been more or less killed off by Unesco, and replaced by a partly European team. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Unesco has officially advised the Haitian government against accepting the US archaeological team\u2019s proposal because \u201cin its current state\u201d it \u201clacked many elements required for the appropriate underwater archaeological research on the concerned site\u201d, and because it \u201cdid not conform\" to the organisation's standards on the protection of underwater cultural heritage. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Santa Maria was the flagship of Christopher Columbus\u2019 three-vessel fleet which discovered the New World. The fleet first reached the Americas on 12 October 1492 when they sighted the Bahamas. 75 days later, at around midnight, while Columbus was asleep, the Santa Maria drifted onto a reef and could not be refloated. Within a few hours the ship\u2019s seams began to open \u2013 and the interior of the vessel was flooded. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Christopher Columbus hired the ship in 1492 and sailed in it from southern Spain\u2019s Atlantic coast in search of a new western route to Asia (Rex) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR However, Columbus and his crew were made welcome by a local Taino chieftain. Columbus then established a fort, left a garrison of 39 men there, and returned to report his discoveries to the King and Queen of Spain.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"This is a great start to an important week of American foreign policy,\" said Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, who has often been critical of Trump on security issues. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But earlier in the day, Trump declined to say definitively whether he believed U.S. intelligence officials who have said that Russia interfered in the 2016 election. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I think it was Russia but I think it was probably other people and/or countries, and I see nothing wrong with that statement. Nobody really knows. Nobody really knows for sure,\u201d Trump said at a news conference, before accusing Democratic former President Barack Obama of not doing enough to tackle hacking. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR SENATORS' CONCERNS NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ahead of Trump\u2019s meeting with Putin, three U.S. senators wrote to Trump to express \u201cdeep concern\u201d about reports that his administration planned to discuss the return to Russia of diplomatic compounds in Maryland and New York that were seized by the Obama administration last year in response to alleged Russian election meddling. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Republican Senators Johnny Isakson and Marco Rubio and Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen said returning the facilities would \"embolden\" Putin and encourage further efforts by Russia to interfere in Western elections. All three are on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The White House declined to offer details on what Trump would request of Putin and what he might offer in exchange for cooperation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Trump wanted to talk about how the two countries can work together to stabilize war-ravaged Syria. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The United States is prepared to explore the possibility of establishing with Russia joint mechanisms for ensuring stability, including no-fly zones, on-the-ground ceasefire observers, and coordinated delivery of humanitarian assistance,\" Tillerson said before leaving the United States to join Trump in Germany. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump was also grappling with a response to North Korea's successful test of an intercontinental ballistic missile, which analysts say had a long enough range to reach Alaska. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Curbing Pyongyang's nuclear ambitions has been Trump's most pressing foreign policy priority, and he met with leaders from Japan and South Korea on Thursday evening to discuss it. He is also slated to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the G20. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I\u2019d like to see the president figure out how to engage Russia on North Korea,\u201d said Representative Francis Rooney, a Republican from Florida who is on the House Foreign Affairs Committee.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR France\u2019s lower house voted by a clear majority on Tuesday to approve the government\u2019s marriage reform, which will allow same-sex couples the same spousal and adoption rights as their heterosexual counterparts. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The legislation, which is President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande\u2019s first major social reform and a key election pledge, was backed by 329 deputies and opposed by 229.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After a two-month trial, the jury in the Casey Anthony murder trial announced they had arrived at a verdict. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Anthony was found not guilty of first-degree murder and the other most serious charges against her in the 2008 death of her 2-year-old daughter. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The nation was first introduced to Casey Anthony in July 2008. The country fell in love with her precious daughter, Caylee, who had gone missing in Orlando, Florida. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A massive missing persons search for the little girl ensued. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Police were suspicious of what Anthony, then 22, was telling them. She lied about her nanny taking the child. She lied about working at Universal Studios. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Anthony suddenly became the most hated woman in America. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On July 16, 2008, Anthony was arrested on suspicion of child neglect. Her attorney was an unknown Florida lawyer named Jose Baez. A Florida grand jury indicted Anthony on capital murder charges October 14, 2008. A utility worker found Caylee's skeletal remains in a wooded area near the Anthony home in December 2008, and several months later, prosecutors announced they would seek the death penalty. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Florida v. Casey Anthony: A look back at evidence and testimony NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Watching in the wings was another Florida lawyer, Cheney Mason. A former president of the Florida Association of Criminal Lawyers, Mason, who just that year had been selected by Florida Monthly magazine as one of Florida's top lawyers, was disgusted with the local media coverage about the relatively inexperienced Baez. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I was offended by it. I was offended by the fact that he wasn't being treated fairly. I didn't know Baez. I had never met him,\" Mason said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Baez started asking Mason, a Florida death penalty qualified attorney, for advice. That propelled Mason to want to meet Anthony. He remembers going to the Orange County jail to introduce himself. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"They brought her to the room, and I have to tell you I was really surprised to see how small she is ... how tiny she is. I stood looking at a child herself. I said this can't be,\" he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I sat down with Mason exclusively to talk with him about his new book, \"Justice in America.\" In it, he insists that the jury got it right, and the rest of the country had it wrong. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Could she look you in the eye?\" I asked. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Oh yes,\" Mason responded, describing her demeanor as quiet, afraid and unsure. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After that meeting, with Anthony's approval, Mason decided to join the team pro bono. He said the unpaid time he spent on the case \"was well over a million dollars\" and cost him tens of thousands of dollars out-of-pocket. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mason said in the years before trial, he normally met with Anthony in a lunch room at the jail. The jail would clear everyone out before Anthony came in. A stationary video camera in the room was positioned on their conversations, so he and Anthony would cover their mouths and speak in low tones to each other, Mason said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Shortly before jury selection was to begin, Mason got word that Anthony's handwritten letters describing sexual abuse at the hands of her father were going to be made public under Florida's open records law. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He believed it was only right that Anthony's parents, George and Cindy, were warned. He called them to his office late on a Friday afternoon. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We had them one at a time come into my personal office and made the announcement: 'Monday's going to be a bad day for you George. I felt man to man I would tell you in advance.\"\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mason said George Anthony's reaction was \"basically none.\" \"He looked at me ... I turned sideways a little bit, he clapped his hands down on his thighs -- let out a big sigh but didn't say anything,\" Mason said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"He never admitted doing anything,\" Mason said. \"All we had were the letters and (separately) the statements Casey had made to the psychiatrist.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Next it was Cindy Anthony's turn. \"We called Mom in, Cindy, and told her and she immediately welled up with emotion, cried, was very upset,\" Mason said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Once a jury was selected it was time for the evidentiary portion of the trial. Baez gave the opening statements. In the midst of telling the jury what the evidence would show, he delivered a bombshell that turned the case on its head by telling the jury that his client was a victim of sexual abuse by her father. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The country was stunned and so was Mason, who was sitting next to Anthony in the courtroom. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I didn't know that he was going to say that. We had talked about all aspects of it, and I did not know. I don't know if anybody knew that he was going to say that other than himself,\" Mason recalled. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I asked Mason if he was concerned the defense would not be able to establish this with evidence as promised during the opening statement. Mason said he was. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Yes, I was concerned about that because I knew we didn't have the ability to prove that unless George got on the stand and confessed,\" he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The prosecution responded by making George Anthony its first witness. The first question Assistant State Attorney Jeff Ashton asked him was whether he had sexually abused his daughter. George Anthony responded with a definitive no. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The trial went on for weeks. Witness after witness took the stand for the prosecution in the largely circumstantial case. They finally rested their case on June 15, 2011. Then it was the defense's turn. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Anthony's defense attorneys maintained that Caylee was not murdered at all. They said the child drowned in the Anthony's above-ground pool, and that Casey Anthony and her father panicked upon finding her there and covered up the death. George Anthony denied that in his testimony. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Casey Anthony: 'I didn't kill my daughter' NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the midst of the defense case, Mason described how out-of-court conversations with the prosecution suddenly turned to possible plea discussions. Anthony was approached with the possibility. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Casey got very angry about that. She got very angry to hear talk about it. She didn't want to hear it.\" Mason said. \"Casey would fight it 'til her last breath. She didn't kill her daughter.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mason said he believes it took a lot of courage and strength for Anthony to end any talk of a plea agreement. She knew what was at stake in this death penalty trial. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR So, plea discussions were stopped in their tracks, Mason said, and the trial went on. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Then, on July 5, 2011, after deliberating for 10 hours, jurors announced they had reached a verdict. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"She was holding her breath like a deep sea diver, waiting as we all were,\" Mason said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Anthony was acquitted by the 12-person jury on the most serious charges, including first-degree murder, aggravated child abuse and aggravated manslaughter of a child. But the jury convicted her on four misdemeanors of providing false information to law enforcement officers. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Anthony now lives in an undisclosed location in Florida and doesn't go out of the home she is living in because of the public hate and continued threats to her life, Mason said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"She has to live constantly on guard. She can't go out in public,\" Mason said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR By her own choice, she works inside the home, Mason said, and is living as \"a housekeeper, clerk, secretary and stuff like that.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I think Casey has a lot of world left to have to deal with. She hasn't been freed from her incarceration yet 'cause she can't go out. She can't go to a beauty parlor, she can't go shopping to a department store, she can't go to a restaurant, she can't even go to McDonald's. She can't do anything,\" he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mason and his wife, Shirley, have continued a relationship with Anthony. Now three years after being acquitted, Mason said Anthony still distrusts the outside world. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Casey is aloof,\" Mason said. \"She is kind of, I think, afraid of people ... she's not real close to. We've had a couple of occasions to have social gatherings that can include her -- close friends, the (legal) team. She still likes to back away from the middle.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 2012: Anthony's 'video diary' surfaces NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Anthony \"does not have any blood family anymore,\" Mason said. The family she has is the residual of the defense team, Dorothy Clay Sims, Lisabeth Fryer and Mason's wife. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mason said although there may have been a few conversations between Anthony and her mother in recent years, there is no relationship. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And as for a relationship with her father? \"None,\" Mason said emphatically. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Shirley Mason has also gotten to know Anthony over the past three years. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I'm a cross between a friend, a mother, but not a mother -- only someone who is older who has had experience in the world she has not had,\" she said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mason gives Anthony advice, but also listens to her when they talk. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"My hope for her is it gets better for her and the world or the people who have been so hateful can let that go and they can move on,\" she said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Anthony \"tries to make her life work,\" Shirley Mason said. She takes care of herself and stays physically fit by working out in the house. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I do think she wants to speak out,\" Mason said. Anthony declined CNN's request for an interview. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I have never asked her that, but I know she has very strong feelings for what has happened to her. I also know she's very saddened by her loss and she will never forget her daughter Caylee, ever.\"\nPassage 2:\nIn promoting his new book about the Casey Anthony trial, Orlando defense attorney J. Cheney Mason told CNN on Thursday that his former client is essentially still imprisoned because of the public's hatred toward her. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mason told CNN that Anthony, who was exonerated in her daughter's death three years ago, is doing some clerical work and legal research. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He didn't disclose where Anthony is living, but said she does not live alone and is not dating. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mason said the public hasn't had a chance to meet the real Casey Anthony. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The veteran attorney's new book, \"Justice in America: How Prosecutors and the Media Conspire Against the Accused,\" is slated to be released this summer.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mason is the third attorney associated with the Anthony case to author a book about the 2011 trial, and said his reveals many things the others did not. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"This is not a book about me,\" Mason told the Sentinel. \"It's not a book solely about Casey, by any means.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mason said his book addresses legal issues, the impact of the media and bias in the court, and will include copies of motions filed in the case. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The book will also provide behind-the-scenes information that the media and public weren't privy to. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR According to a summary of the book on amazon.com, Mason \"shares never before revealed media bias, and enough case secrets to make readers re-examine their conscience and the quick path to judgment and personal conviction of Anthony.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mason's co-counsel on the Anthony trial, attorney Jose Baez, and prosecutor Jeff Ashton each penned best-selling books about the case.

Attorneys for the alleged victims, USA Gymnastics, the school and other parties to the lawsuit are engaged in court-ordered mediation in an effort to reach a settlement. Attorneys have said that more women are expected to join the lawsuits. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It is not known whether Raisman or Maroney are part of those lawsuits. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Nassar has already pleaded guilty to federal child pornography charges and is in jail, awaiting a Dec. 7 sentencing in that case. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He also faces charges in state court in Michigan, largely related to allegations that he digitally penetrated women during medical exams for his own sexual gratification. If convicted on any one of the 22 counts of first-degree criminal sexual conduct, Nassar could be sentenced to life in prison. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the past, Nassar and his attorneys have defended the intra-vaginal and intra-rectal procedures as accepted medical practice. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Nassar was a trainer with USA Gymnastics as far back as 1986. In 1996, he was named national medical coordinator, a position he held until the summer of 2015. Nassar resigned his position from USA Gymnastics shortly after concerns were raised about his behavior during medical exams. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR USA Gymnastics never informed Nassar's employer at the time, Michigan State University, about the circumstances surrounding Nassar's resignation, and he continued to treat patients in Michigan until he was fired by the school in September 2016. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Raisman has called for change within the sport. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I am angry,\" Raisman told \"60 Minutes.\" \"I'm really upset because it's been -- I care a lot, you know, when I see these young girls that come up to me, and they ask for pictures or autographs, whatever it is, I just ... I can't ... every time I look at them, every time I see them smiling, I just think ... I just want to create change so that they never, ever have to go through this.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Raisman has also called for sweeping changes in leadership, including the removal of the chairman of the board, Paul Parilla. USA Gymnastics hired Kerry Perry as its new president and CEO on Tuesday after president Steve Penny resigned in March after 12 years on the job. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Raisman and Maroney are the highest-profile gymnasts yet to come forward publicly claiming abuse by Nassar. Jamie Dantzscher, a bronze medalist on the 2000 U.S. Olympic team, was part of the initial wave of lawsuits filed against Nassar in 2016. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The list of Nassar's accusers also includes several former national team members. Jeanette Antolin, Jessica Howard and Kami MacKay have all come forward, alleging abuse by Nassar either through the filing of lawsuits or, in the case of MacKay, on social media. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR USA Gymnastics launched an independent review of its policies in the wake of the allegations against Nassar in the summer of 2016, following reporting by the Indianapolis Star that highlighted chronic mishandling of abuse allegations against coaches and staff at some of its more than 3,500 clubs across the country. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In June, the federation immediately adopted 70 recommendations proffered by Deborah Daniels, a former federal prosecutor who oversaw the review. The new guidelines require member gyms to go to authorities immediately, with Daniels suggesting USA Gymnastics consider withholding membership from clubs that decline to do so. The organization also named Toby Stark, a child welfare advocate, as its director of SafeSport. Part of Stark's mandate is educating members on rules, educational programs, reporting and adjudication services.

Our Lady of Guadalupe, in Mexico, draws millions of fervent worshipers a year. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Now, a little chapel among the dairy farms here, called Our Lady of Good Help, has joined that august company in terms of religious status, if not global fame. This month, it became one of only about a dozen sites worldwide, and the first in the United States, where apparitions of the Virgin Mary have been officially validated by the Roman Catholic Church. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In 1859, the year after Mary is said to have appeared in Lourdes, a Belgian immigrant here named Adele Brise said she was visited three times by Mary, who hovered between two trees in a bright light, clothed in dazzling white with a yellow sash around her waist and a crown of stars above her flowing blond locks. As instructed, Ms. Brise devoted her life to teaching Catholic beliefs to children. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Dec. 8, after a two-year investigation by theologians who found no evidence of fraud or heresy and a long history of shrine-related conversions, cures and other signs of divine intervention, Bishop David L. Ricken of Green Bay declared \u201cwith moral certainty\u201d that Ms. Brise did indeed have encounters \u201cof a supernatural character\u201d that are \u201cworthy of belief.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Lourdes-like hordes have not yet gathered, but since the weighty decree a growing stream of visitors, some driving several hours, has found its way here to pray and revel in what many say is the palpable presence of Mary. Calls are coming in from as far as New York from church groups that want to visit by the busload, and local church officials are wondering whether they thought too small when they built a new parking lot \u2014 planned well before this month \u2014 with 75 spaces. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Debbie Banda, 46, and her mother, Mary Young, 75, who live nearby, learned of the shrine and the bishop\u2019s decision from the news, and came for the first time on Wednesday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cIt\u2019s incredible \u2014 she\u2019s here, you just feel it,\u201d Ms. Banda said after praying in the crypt chapel, said to be on the spot of the apparitions. As they passed a statue of Mary in white, just as described by Ms. Brise, Ms. Banda was overcome with emotion, weeping and hugging her mother. The two of them went back to pray some more. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cWe need the Virgin Mary\u2019s protection, and for her to keep an eye on our soldiers, too,\u201d said Ms. Young, whose sons have served in the Middle East. \u201cWe\u2019ll definitely be coming back.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Catholic leaders described the decree in Wisconsin as a bolt of joy at a trying time for the Catholic church, which is troubled by revelations of sex abuse. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cThis is a gift to the believers,\u201d said the Rev. Johann Roten, director of the International Marian Research Institute at the University of Dayton.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Now, a little chapel among the dairy farms here, called Our Lady of Good Help, has joined that august company in terms of religious status, if not global fame.

As instructed, Ms. Brise devoted her life to teaching Catholic beliefs to children. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Dec. 8, after a two-year investigation by theologians who found no evidence of fraud or heresy and a long history of shrine-related conversions, cures and other signs of divine intervention, Bishop David L.

In all, nine women in Sweden have received new wombs since 2012, but two had to have them removed because of complications. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The women received wombs donated by their mothers or other close relatives in an experimental procedure designed to test whether it's possible to transfer a uterus so a woman can give birth to her own biological child. The women had in vitro fertilization before the transplants, using their own eggs to make embryos. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We have already begun transferring embryos into four of the women and plan to make attempts with the others when they are ready,\" said Dr. Mats Brannstrom, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Goteburg, who is leading the research.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The transplants are intended to benefit women unable to have children because they lost a uterus to cancer or were born without one.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mark Udall, a champion of government transparency, urged the president today to publicly support the fullest declassification possible of the U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence's exhaustive study of the CIA's detention and interrogation program. Udall, who serves on the committee, said anything less will not set the record straight on this dark chapter of the CIA's history. Udall also said without significant progress on his previous requests and on removing obstacles to committee oversight of the CIA's detention and interrogation program, he will be unable to support advancing Caroline Krass's nomination to be CIA general counsel.\nPassage 2:\n\u2014 The CIA Inspector General\u0092s Office has asked the Justice Department to investigate allegations of malfeasance at the spy agency in connection with a yet-to-be released Senate Intelligence Committee report into the CIA\u0092s secret detention and interrogation program, McClatchy has learned. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The criminal referral may be related to what several knowledgeable people said was CIA monitoring of computers used by Senate aides to prepare the study. The monitoring may have violated an agreement between the committee and the agency. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The development marks an unprecedented breakdown in relations between the CIA and its congressional overseers amid an extraordinary closed-door battle over the 6,300-page report on the agency\u0092s use of waterboarding and harsh interrogation techniques on suspected terrorists held in secret overseas prisons. The report is said to be a searing indictment of the program. The CIA has disputed some of the reports findings. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR White House officials have closely tracked the bitter struggle, a McClatchy investigation has found. But they haven\u0092t directly intervened, perhaps because they are embroiled in their own feud with the committee, resisting surrendering top-secret documents that the CIA asserted were covered by executive privilege and sent to the White House. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR McClatchy\u0092s findings are based on information found in official documents and provided by people with knowledge of the dispute being fought in the seventh-floor executive offices of the CIA\u0092s headquarters in Langley, Va., and the committee\u0092s high-security work spaces on Capitol Hill. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The people who spoke to McClatchy asked not to be identified because the feud involves highly classified matters and carries enormous consequences for congressional oversight over the executive branch. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The CIA and the committee declined to comment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Caitlin Hayden, a spokeswoman for the National Security Council, declined to discuss the matter and referred questions to the CIA and the Justice Department. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In question now is whether any part of the committee\u0092s report, which took some four years to compose and cost $40 million, will ever see the light of day. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The report details how the CIA misled the Bush administration and Congress about the use of interrogation techniques that many experts consider torture, according to public statements by committee members. It also shows, members have said, how the techniques didn\u0092t provide the intelligence that led the CIA to the hideout in Pakistan where Osama bin Laden was killed in a 2011 raid by Navy SEALs. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The committee determined earlier this year that the CIA monitored computers \u0096 in possible violation of an agreement against doing so \u0096 that the agency had provided to intelligence committee staff in a secure room at CIA headquarters that the agency insisted they use to review millions of pages of top-secret reports, cables and other documents, according to people with knowledge. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Oregon, a panel member, apparently was referring to the monitoring when he asked CIA Director John Brennan at a Jan. 29 hearing if provisions of the Federal Computer Fraud and Abuse Act \u0093apply to the CIA? Seems to me that\u0092s a yes or no answer.\u0094 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Brennan replied that he\u0092d have to get back to Wyden after looking into \u0093what the act actually calls for and it\u0092s applicability to CIA\u0092s authorities.\u0094 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The law makes it a criminal act for someone to intentionally access a computer without authorization or to go beyond what they\u0092re allowed to access. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR People familiar with the issue said it wasn\u0092t clear whether the monitoring violated any law or administrative regulations. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sen. Mark Udall, D-Colo., who has led calls for the CIA to allow the release of the report, also appeared to be referring to the monitoring in a letter he sent Tuesday to President Barack Obama. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u0093As you are aware, the CIA has recently taken unprecedented action against the committee in relation to the internal CIA review and I find these actions to be incredibly troubling for the committee\u0092s oversight responsibilities and for our democracy,\u0094 Udall wrote. \u0093It is essential that the committee be able to do its oversight work \u0096 consistent with our constitutional principle of the separation of powers \u0096 without the CIA posing impediments or obstacles as it is today.\u0094 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Udall also called on Obama to strip the CIA of control over how much of the Senate report should be made public. The report remains classified nearly 15 months after the panel approved the document and turned it over to the agency for vetting. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u0093It is my belief that the declassification of the Committee Study is of paramount importance and that decisions about what should or should not be declassified regarding this issue should not be delegated to the CIA, but directly handled by the White House,\u0094 Udall wrote.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mark Udall, a champion of government transparency, urged the president today to publicly support the fullest declassification possible of the U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence's exhaustive study of the CIA's detention and interrogation program. Udall, who serves on the committee, said anything less will not set the record straight on this dark chapter of the CIA's history. Udall also said without significant progress on his previous requests and on removing obstacles to committee oversight of the CIA's detention and interrogation program, he will be unable to support advancing Caroline Krass's nomination to be CIA general counsel.\nPassage 2:\n\u2014 The CIA Inspector General\u0092s Office has asked the Justice Department to investigate allegations of malfeasance at the spy agency in connection with a yet-to-be released Senate Intelligence Committee report into the CIA\u0092s secret detention and interrogation program, McClatchy has learned. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The criminal referral may be related to what several knowledgeable people said was CIA monitoring of computers used by Senate aides to prepare the study. The monitoring may have violated an agreement between the committee and the agency. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The development marks an unprecedented breakdown in relations between the CIA and its congressional overseers amid an extraordinary closed-door battle over the 6,300-page report on the agency\u0092s use of waterboarding and harsh interrogation techniques on suspected terrorists held in secret overseas prisons. The report is said to be a searing indictment of the program. The CIA has disputed some of the reports findings. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR White House officials have closely tracked the bitter struggle, a McClatchy investigation has found. But they haven\u0092t directly intervened, perhaps because they are embroiled in their own feud with the committee, resisting surrendering top-secret documents that the CIA asserted were covered by executive privilege and sent to the White House. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR McClatchy\u0092s findings are based on information found in official documents and provided by people with knowledge of the dispute being fought in the seventh-floor executive offices of the CIA\u0092s headquarters in Langley, Va., and the committee\u0092s high-security work spaces on Capitol Hill. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The people who spoke to McClatchy asked not to be identified because the feud involves highly classified matters and carries enormous consequences for congressional oversight over the executive branch. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The CIA and the committee declined to comment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Caitlin Hayden, a spokeswoman for the National Security Council, declined to discuss the matter and referred questions to the CIA and the Justice Department. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In question now is whether any part of the committee\u0092s report, which took some four years to compose and cost $40 million, will ever see the light of day. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The report details how the CIA misled the Bush administration and Congress about the use of interrogation techniques that many experts consider torture, according to public statements by committee members. It also shows, members have said, how the techniques didn\u0092t provide the intelligence that led the CIA to the hideout in Pakistan where Osama bin Laden was killed in a 2011 raid by Navy SEALs. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The committee determined earlier this year that the CIA monitored computers \u0096 in possible violation of an agreement against doing so \u0096 that the agency had provided to intelligence committee staff in a secure room at CIA headquarters that the agency insisted they use to review millions of pages of top-secret reports, cables and other documents, according to people with knowledge. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Oregon, a panel member, apparently was referring to the monitoring when he asked CIA Director John Brennan at a Jan. 29 hearing if provisions of the Federal Computer Fraud and Abuse Act \u0093apply to the CIA? Seems to me that\u0092s a yes or no answer.\u0094 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Brennan replied that he\u0092d have to get back to Wyden after looking into \u0093what the act actually calls for and it\u0092s applicability to CIA\u0092s authorities.\u0094 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The law makes it a criminal act for someone to intentionally access a computer without authorization or to go beyond what they\u0092re allowed to access. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR People familiar with the issue said it wasn\u0092t clear whether the monitoring violated any law or administrative regulations. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sen. Mark Udall, D-Colo., who has led calls for the CIA to allow the release of the report, also appeared to be referring to the monitoring in a letter he sent Tuesday to President Barack Obama. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u0093As you are aware, the CIA has recently taken unprecedented action against the committee in relation to the internal CIA review and I find these actions to be incredibly troubling for the committee\u0092s oversight responsibilities and for our democracy,\u0094 Udall wrote. \u0093It is essential that the committee be able to do its oversight work \u0096 consistent with our constitutional principle of the separation of powers \u0096 without the CIA posing impediments or obstacles as it is today.\u0094 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Udall also called on Obama to strip the CIA of control over how much of the Senate report should be made public. The report remains classified nearly 15 months after the panel approved the document and turned it over to the agency for vetting. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u0093It is my belief that the declassification of the Committee Study is of paramount importance and that decisions about what should or should not be declassified regarding this issue should not be delegated to the CIA, but directly handled by the White House,\u0094 Udall wrote. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Udall has led a handful of lawmakers in pressing for the release of the report\u0092s conclusions, which committee members have publicly said show that the CIA misled the Bush administration and Congress about the intelligence gained from using water-boarding and other interrogation techniques.

{"prompt": "You are given several news passages. Write a one-page summary of all news. \n\nNews:\nPassage 1:\n'Alien: Covenant': Film Review NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Michael Fassbender, Katherine Waterston and Billy Crudup lead the ensemble of Ridley Scott's second installment in the 'Alien' prequel series. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There's life in the old bugger yet. And, as always, plenty of death. After the Alien series looked as though it had hit the rocks creatively (not for the first time) with the last entry, Prometheus, five years ago, savvy old master Ridley Scott has resuscitated it, and then some, with Alien: Covenant, the most satisfying entry in the six-films-and-counting franchise since the first two. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Gripping through its full two hours and spiked with some real surprises, this beautifully made sci-fi thriller will immeasurably boost fan interest in the run of prequels which Scott has recently said will consist of at least two more films until the action catches up to the 1979 original. This Fox release is a lock for major early summer box-office worldwide. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Is there a director who has ever been artistically committed to a franchise as long as Scott has to the Alien series? None comes to mind (Steven Spielberg made his first Indiana Jones adventure, Raiders of the Lost Ark, in 1981, two years after Alien was released). It's a matter of record that Scott will turn 80 later this year, and Clint Eastwood will be 87 when he starts his new film; from the evidence on the screen, 80 may well be the new 50 where some top helmers are concerned, especially those who, like Scott and Eastwood, make a new film almost every year. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It also helped to recruit a couple of very good writers, John Logan and Dante Harper, to dig the series out of its hole. No matter that these aliens have been around far longer than most of the viewers who will see this film opening weekend have been alive; this entry feels vital, freshly thought out and keen to keep us on our toes right up to the concluding scene, which leaves the audience with such a great reveal that it makes you want to see the next installment tomorrow. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The elegantly spare opening, in which a \u201csynthetic,\u201d Walter (Michael Fassbender), engages his \u201cfather\u201d (an uncredited Guy Pearce) in a pointedly philosophical conversation, simply and effectively frames the thrust of the film's central interest in human life's origins and its prospects for survival. Casual viewers may assume that Walter is the same character Fassbender played in Prometheus. But, no, Walter, who sports an American, not British, accent, is an updated version of that all-purpose butler, factotum and technical wizard \u2014 a far friendlier iteration of the know-it-all computer Hal in 2001: A Space Odyssey. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And as in 2001, Alien: Covenant involves a long outer space voyage during which the 2,000 human passengers, along with 1,140 embryos, will linger in a deep-freeze sleep for several years while the humanoid plays watchdog. The giant ship, called Covenant, is headed for a very distant planet, Origae-6, which is considered a promising new home for humanity to settle. For this reason, not only the slumbering immigrants, but the crew, too, are composed of prospective parents meant to propagate and establish a new homeland for homo sapiens. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This couples-only orientation lends a fresh feel to this group of space travelers, and definitely cranks up the emotional distress quotient as partners start splitting open and giving birth to the wrong kind of offspring. When a space storm hits and damages the ship's giant wind sails, the first to perish is the ship's captain (James Franco, seen ever-so-briefly), which devastates his mate Daniels (Katherine Waterston), assigned to oversee terraforming on humankind's new planet. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This accident promotes second-in-command Christopher (Billy Crudup) to run the show, but he's portrayed from the outset as uncertain and lacking in confidence; more than that, he's a \u201cperson of faith,\u201d which puts him at great philosophical odds with most of the others. Unfortunately, once this element is introduced, the writers don't do much with it, so it feels like a missed opportunity to engage in some pithy religion vs. science debate. Worse, the character's overriding weakness as a man won't go over too well with faith-based audiences. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Not only that, but when the crew discovers a nearby \u201chidden planet\u201d that seems potentially compatible to human life, it's Christopher who makes the fateful decision to land there rather than to continue with their seven-year-long voyage. Farris (Amy Seimetz), the flier wife of the Covenant's main pilot Tennessee (Danny McBride), goes down for a peek and it looks pretty darn good, just like New Zealand, in fact, where half the world wants to move to right now. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But as inviting as are the beautiful landscapes, mountains and lakes, there's trouble lurking in the magnificent flora and fauna and, given the particulars of this bloody franchise, it doesn't take long for humans to fall ill and start bursting with nasty and ferocious critters they never imagined could spring from their innards. This is not the sort of propagation the earthlings had in mind when they set off. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In a brilliant stroke, the voyagers also encounter David, Walter's double, the very same \u201csynthetic\u201d who co-starred in Prometheus. Distinguishable from his supposedly new and improved relative by virtue of his long hair and British accent, this lone survivor of the previous voyage, who lives among the ruins of a great civilization wiped out by the aliens, gives Fassbender the delicious opportunity of a double performance. The actor makes the most of it, subtly delineating two nearly identical characters as they enact a contest for dominance, the details of which touch in clear but unpretentious ways on the notion of playing God. What goes down between the two remains uncertain right up to the fabulously diabolical twist ending. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Scott and the writers have achieved an outstanding balance in Alien: Covenant among numerous different elements: Intelligent speculation and textbook sci-fi presumptions, startlingly inventive action and audience-pleasing old standbys, philosophical considerations and inescapable genre conventions, intense visual splendor and gore at its most grisly. The drama flows gorgeously and, unlike in many other franchises in which entries keep getting longer every time out, this one is served up without an ounce of fat. It provides all the tension and action the mainstream audience could want, along with a good deal more. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Stylistically, the film is a thing of cool beauty, with superb effects and a lovely score. Creatively, it's a major reset on a level with the series' best.

Directed by Ridley Scott. Opens Friday in major theatres. 122 minutes. 18A The cast keeps expanding and the critters keep evolving, but there\u2019s one constant to Ridley Scott\u2019s Alien series. It\u2019s the horrific fear of personal invasion, by something that\u2019s about to leap up and latch onto you, causing unimaginable mayhem. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Article Continued Below NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Alien: Covenant has this dread in abundance. It ranks among the better chapters of a sci-fi horror franchise that began with the original Alien in 1979. Scott knows he dropped the ball with Prometheus, the erstwhile Alien prequel he foisted onto the unhappy masses in 2012. It barely showed the infamous beasties, choosing instead to batter senses with windy dialogue and events that seemed to betray basic elements of this decades-long saga. Alien: Covenant brings back the visceral panic that fans expect from the franchise, along with the show-stopping title creatures: among them the face-hugger, the chest-burster and the canoe-headed xenomorph of artist H.R. Giger\u2019s terrifying imagination. They\u2019re waiting to greet the unsuspecting crew of the spaceship Covenant, who have travelled to the far reaches of the galaxy in search of an Earthlike planet to colonize. (The most terrifying thing of all, barely acknowledged, is the thought of what must have happened to Earth if large-scale evacuations are underway.) The Covenant carries 2,000 passengers and 1,140 human embryos, all frozen in cryogenic deep sleep and with an emphasis on preserving couples and families as they make the years-long journey to a planet called Origae-6. Something happens that interrupts the journey and prompts the exploration of an unknown closer planet that looks to be every bit as inviting \u2014 until events prove that theory disastrously wrong. Scott and screenwriters John Logan (Spectre) and Dante Harper tidy up loose ends from Prometheus, making a much better story of the gods vs. men vs. machines ideas that director Scott has being exploring for decades, with Alien and also with Blade Runner. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In so doing, they revive a moribund franchise in much the same way The Force Awakens reignited the Star Wars saga, by reconjuring characters and themes from the past. It won\u2019t take you long to figure out who the \u201cRipley\u201d character is here, for example, and the perilous planet narrative dates right back to the original Alien, and indeed to the dawn of sci-fi moviemaking. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Article Continued Below NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This might make the film seem too derivative for some. But for those willing to embrace the retro elements \u2014 count me among them \u2014 it works like gangbusters. And a story like this can\u2019t get by on terror alone. It also needs good actors to put it across, and Alien: Covenant more than delivers on that score. Michael Fassbender reprises his android character David from Prometheus, but this mechanical man acquires deeper intrigue when he\u2019s matched against his factory double, an upgraded model named Walter, also played by Fassbender. This is a grand performance times two that demands to be remembered at awards time. Other standouts from the brilliant cast are Katherine Waterston as fearless scientist Daniels, Danny McBride as good ol\u2019 boy pilot Tennessee and Billy Crudup as tragically promoted second-in-command Christopher, a weak man who assumes authority at exactly the wrong time. (Watch also for cameos from Guy Pearce and James Franco, as they help connect the dots between Prometheus and Alien: Covenant.) Cinematographer Dariusz Wolski and composer Jed Kurzel skilfully combine to boost the film\u2019s fear of the unknown. They make the remote New Zealand shooting locale look and sound both like the verdant paradise the mystery planet is thought to be and the brutal hellhole it actually is. Franchise films very often disappoint, especially as later instalments run out of fresh ideas. Not so Alien: Covenant, which breaks new ground even while revisiting old concepts. It leaves us seriously wondering what will happen next, but I can\u2019t tell you more or you\u2019ll yell \u2014 not only on Earth, but maybe also in space, where no one can hear you scream.\n\n\nNow, write a one-page summary of all the news.\n\nSummary:", "input": "", "context": "Passage 1:\n'Alien: Covenant': Film Review NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Michael Fassbender, Katherine Waterston and Billy Crudup lead the ensemble of Ridley Scott's second installment in the 'Alien' prequel series.

He calls Alien: Covenant \"the most satisfying entry in the six-films-and-counting franchise since the first two.\" Beautiful and gripping, it \"feels vital\" and is \"keen to keep us on our toes right up to the concluding scene, which leaves the audience with such a great reveal that it makes you want to see the next installment tomorrow.\" Peter Howell at the Toronto Star agrees this flick \"ranks among the better chapters\" of the franchise. Scott \"breaks new ground even while revisiting old concepts\" and \"brings back the visceral panic that fans expect.\" Actors Katherine Waterston, Danny McBride, Billy Crudup, and Michael Fassbender\u2014who delivers \"a grand performance times two\" as two separate robots\u2014also deserve high praise, he writes. The inclusion of Fassbender's David, from 2012's Prometheus, was an incredibly smart move, writes Joe Morgenstern at the Wall Street Journal. But there was little else that impressed him. There's just \"nothing new\" to this \"gore fest,\" he writes. He acknowledges, however, that \"many Alien fans will come looking for something old, and that's in bloodily abundant supply.\" Chris Klimek had his own issues with the film. For example, \"a religious subtext is introduced and then immediately abandoned,\" he writes at NPR. But he, too, had to marvel at Fassbender, whose \"existential rap session\" provides the \"freshest part of the movie.\" Then again, Fassbender's David \"is the only character in whom Scott seems truly interested,\" he writes."], "length": 2356, "dataset": "multi_news_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "5c8c8d3158f3342ca74e9ce9da1508e49fe9a5abb156a80c", "pred": " Ridley Scott's latest film, Alien: Covenant, has received positive reviews from critics.

Frank Lautenberg. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Newark Mayor Cory Booker defeated three experienced politicians _ U.S. Reps. Rush Holt and Frank Pallone, who had the support of Lautenberg's family, and state Assembly Speaker Sheila Oliver _ in a Democratic primary that may have been more competitive had the field been less crowded. The race was a major draw for them partly because of New Jersey's history of electing only Democrats to the Senate over the past 40 years. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the Republican primary, former Bogota mayor Steve Lonegan won handily over Franklin Township physician Alieta Eck, who had never run for office before, even though she received support of some tea party organizations. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The election is on a compressed schedule. The day after Lautenberg's death, Republican Gov. Chris Christie scheduled the primaries for Tuesday and a special election for Oct. 16, 20 days before the voting day on which he's seeking re-election.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He is in his second term as mayor. In the city, reviews are mixed, but his narrative has helped make him well-known elsewhere.

He's also given 90 paid speeches across the country since 2008, collecting $1.3 million, nearly half of which he has donated to charity. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Lonegan, who stepped down from his job as state director of the anti-tax group Americans for Prosperity, focused his primary campaign on blasting Booker. He held a news conference to ridicule Booker's broad anti-childhood poverty plan and another at the scene of a homicide in Newark to question whether Booker has done much to reduce crime.

Write a one-page summary of all news. \n\nNews:\nPassage 1:\nA judge has resigned over his conduct of a rape trial in the face of a blistering recommendation for his removal from a national disciplinary body. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Federal Court Justice Robin Camp had asked a complainant in a 2014 rape trial why she did not keep her knees together, and mocked the law of consent. At a hearing conducted last fall by a disciplinary panel established by the Canadian Judicial Council, the 19-year-old homeless complainant said Justice Camp\u2019s comment made her hate herself and feel like a slut. After the panel unanimously recommended his removal, Justice Camp went to great lengths to save his job. He publicly apologized to the complainant and his fellow judges. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Justice minister on resignation of 'knees together\u2019 judge (The Canadian Press) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He called his knees-together comment \u201cunforgivable,\u201d and acknowledged that he had perceived the complainant\u2019s fragility. He attended in-depth counselling and education sessions with several feminist scholars, three of whom testified at his disciplinary hearing last fall (attended daily by his wife and daughter) that he was sincerely interested in changing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Related: Before Justice Camp, these two judges were recommended for removal NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Unfounded: Police dismiss 1 in 5 sexual assault claims as baseless, Globe investigation reveals NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And he fought for an opportunity to appear in person before the larger body of judicial council members who considered the panel\u2019s recommendation, to explain to them that he had acted out of \u201cignorance, not animus.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The council would receive only written submissions from him. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR By a vote of 19 to 4, the judicial council said in its ruling released on Thursday that the deep harm Justice Camp had done to public confidence made his dismissal necessary. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cWe find that the Judge\u2019s conduct, viewed in its totality and in light of all of its consequences, was so manifestly and profoundly destructive of the concept of impartiality, integrity and independence of the judicial role that public confidence is sufficiently undermined to render the Judge incapable of executing the judicial office,\u201d the council said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR All four dissenters, who found Judge Camp guilty of misconduct but opposed his dismissal, are male, and from the Atlantic provinces (one is Chief Justice of the Tax Court of Canada). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Alice Woolley, the president of the Canadian Association for Legal Ethics and a law professor at the University of Calgary, who, along with three other professors, filed the first complaint against Justice Camp, said she is pleased with the outcome. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cI don\u2019t think anything would have been served by carrying this on any further,\u201d she said. \u201cThe denunciation was unequivocal. I think [resigning] was the admirable decision on his part and the right thing to do.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Constance Backhouse, chair in sexual assault legislation at the University of Ottawa\u2019s law school, said rape myths are still pervasive in the justice system and society. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cOur legal system still remains mired in 19th-century stereotypes about women, who are suspected of duplicity, promiscuity, malice, and false testimony,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd our legal thinking reflects the wider culture, which shares far too many of these notions. Until we get over the premise that it is women alone who are responsible for protecting themselves from rape, I suspect we will see more such trials and more protests demanding a woman\u2019s right to sexual autonomy.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The law of consent and the judiciary\u2019s handling of sexual-assault trials continue to create controversy. In Nova Scotia, a judge acquitted a taxi driver last week of sexually assaulting a female passenger, saying \u201ca drunk can consent.\u201d That ruling is under appeal. The woman was so drunk she had urinated on herself and passed out in the back seat. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Recommendations that judges in effect be fired are rare in the Canadian system, which deems judicial independence a cornerstone. Justice Camp is only the third judge whose removal has been recommended since the judicial council was established in 1971. Both of the others also resigned rather than be removed under a provision of the Constitution that requires Parliament to approve dismissing a judge. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Justice Camp\u2019s comments came in the trial of Alexander Wagar in Calgary. The ruling came to light a year later, when the Alberta Court of Appeal overturned it, saying the judge had applied myths and stereotypes about sexual-assault victims. (By then, the Conservative government of Stephen Harper had promoted him from provincial court.) The judicial council received scores of complaints. Alberta Justice Minister Kathleen Ganley asked for the public disciplinary hearing. \u201cOn reviewing the transcripts, I felt it was important that victims know this was not an acceptable way to be treated by the justice system,\u201d Ms. Ganley said in an e-mail to The Globe after Justice Camp resigned. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Justice Camp, a father of three, received his law degree in 1975 from Stellenbosch University in South Africa, passed exams in Canada in 1998 and was admitted to the Alberta bar in 1999. In 2012, the Progressive Conservative government of Alison Redford appointed him to the Provincial Court. Before then, he practised business law in Calgary. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Federal Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould brought a motion to the House of Commons in which she declared the government\u2019s intent to support the recommendation for removal. Shortly afterward, Justice Camp issued a brief statement through his lawyer, Frank Addario of Toronto, expressing his \u201csincere apology to everyone who was hurt by my comments during the Wagar trial.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR With a report from Patrick White NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Report Typo/Error\nPassage 2:\nA judge who asked a sexual assault complainant why she couldn't keep her \u201cknees together\u201d confirmed he will resign after the Canadian Judicial Council recommended his removal. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Justice Robin Camp issued a statement Thursday in which he said he will resign from the Federal Court of Canada effective Friday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cI would like to express my sincere apology to everyone who was hurt by my comments,\u201d Camp\u2019s statement went on. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I thank everyone who was generous and kind to me and my family in the last 15 months, particularly my legal team.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Canadian Judicial Council\u2019s report called Camp\u2019s conduct \u201cso manifestly and profoundly destructive of the concept of impartiality, integrity and independence of the judicial role that the judge was rendered incapable of executing the judicial office.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Justice Camp\u2019s lawyer Frank Addario had argued that removal was not necessary to preserve public confidence in this case. Four of the council's 23 members did not support removal. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould was in the process of moving forward on the council\u2019s recommendation in Parliament Thursday when she learned of Camp\u2019s resignation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Wilson-Raybould later told reporters that the extremely rare removal would have been needed \u201cto ensure the integrity and public confidence in the justice system and the judiciary.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cSexual assault and gender-based violence is in no form acceptable and we will continue to stand up for victims of sexual assault and gender-based violence,\u201d Wilson-Raybould added. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Norman Sabourin, Executive Director and Senior General Council at the Canadian Judicial Council, told CTV News Channel removals are recommended when the \u201cpublic has lost confidence in a judge\u2019s ability to discharge the duties of office.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cThe report of the council emphasizes that all judges have to know the law but also have to possess empathy, have to understand that people who come before them are often vulnerable people and they have to treat them with a degree of civility and deference,\u201d Sabourin said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Camp, who was appointed to the federal court in 2015, faced judicial review after it was revealed that he had stated in a 2014 Alberta provincial court decision that \"pain and sex sometimes go together\u201d and asked the complainant why she didn\u2019t just \u201ckeep her knees together.\u201d He also said, \"Young wom[e]n want to have sex, particularly if they're drunk.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Alexander Wagar was acquitted by Camp. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Alberta\u2019s Appeal Court ordered a new trial and last month Wagar was again acquitted. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The complainant, who was 19 at the time of the first trial, told the disciplinary hearing last year that Camp's comments had made her hate herself. She said she had contemplated suicide as a result of her experience. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After Thursday\u2019s decision, the complainant said \"I was feeling so unhopeful and pretty down and not very hopeful about the justice system but it has kind of turned around by this.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u2018Watershed moment\u2019 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Alice Woolley, the University of Calgary law professor who complained about Camp\u2019s conduct, said she was pleased with the decision. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cActors within the legal system can make really terrible decisions and terrible mistakes and in his case engage in real misconduct,\u201d she said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cBut the legal system orients towards progress,\u201d she added. \u201cIt tries to get it right in the end.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kathleen Mahoney, who is also a law professor at the University of Calgary, told CTV News Channel that she believes the removal is a \u201cwatershed moment\u201d in how courts treat sexual assault. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cI think this is a very strong statement from the judges of Canada that the time has come that gender bias in these kinds of decisions will no longer be tolerated,\u201d she said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mahoney added that she believes the case highlights the need for mandatory judicial training focusing on gendered issues such sexual assault, domestic violence and sexual harassment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Conservatives have introduced legislation that would require better training for judges in handling sexual assault cases. The justice minister agreed Thursday that judges need to be properly trained. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Camp\u2019s decision is not the only recent case to raise questions about how judges handle sexual assault. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In Halifax earlier this month, Justice Gregory Lenehan acquitted a taxi driver accused of sexually assaulting a passenger so intoxicated that she passed out. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Lenehan said in his ruling that \u201cclearly, a drunk can consent.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR With a report from CTV\u2019s Glen McGregor and files from The Canadian Press\nPassage 3:\nFederal Court Justice Robin Camp, dubbed the \"knees together judge\" for his comments in a sex assault case, has submitted his resignation following a recommendation from Canada's judicial watchdog that he be removed from the bench. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In a ruling announced Thursday afternoon, the Canadian Judicial Council (CJC) said that at a 2014 sexual assault trial he was presiding over, Camp \"showed obvious disdain for some of the characteristics of the regime enacted by Parliament in respect of sexual assault issues.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We find that the judge's conduct, viewed in its totality and in light of all of its consequences, was so manifestly and profoundly destructive of the concept of impartiality, integrity and independence of the judicial role that public confidence is sufficiently undermined to render the judge incapable of executing the judicial office,\" the council's ruling reads. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In a statement from his lawyer, Camp announced his intention to resign and apologized. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I have advised Chief Justice Crampton that effective March 10, 2017, I will resign as a member of the Federal Court of Canada,\" the statement read. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I would like to express my sincere apology to everyone who was hurt by my comments during the [sex assault] trial. I thank everyone who was generous and kind to me and my family in the last 15 months, particularly my legal team.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Before Camp's statement was issued, Justice Minister and Attorney General Jody Wilson-Raybould rose in the House of Commons seeking unanimous consent for a motion to remove Camp from the bench, but that consent was denied. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Conservative Saskatchewan MP Tom Lukiwksi then rose on a point of order and complained the minister had not ensured she had the unanimous consent of all parties before moving her motion. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Votes in both the House of Commons and the Senate are required to remove a federal judge, a move presumably no longer required with Camp's resignation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Wilson-Raybould told reporters on Parliament Hill she learned of Camp's decision after she sought support for her motion. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The unexpected move by the federal Justice Minister was stopped by an opposition MP 1:05 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Court transcripts from the 2014 sexual assault trial show Camp, who was then a provincial court judge, called the complainant, who was homeless and 19 years old at the time of the alleged assault, \"the accused\" numerous times \u2014 a mistake he repeated at the judicial council hearing before correcting himself. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Camp also told the young woman \"pain and sex sometimes go together\" and asked why she didn't just keep her \"knees together.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'Antithetical' to contemporary values NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The judge apologized several times for those comments, underwent counselling and took additional training on Canada's sexual assault laws. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But that wasn't enough for the CJC. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The statements made by Justice Camp during the trial and in his decision, the values implicit in those statements and the way in which he conducted himself are so antithetical to the contemporary values of our judicial system with respect to the manner in which complainants in sexual assault cases should be treated that, in our view, confidence in the system cannot be maintained unless the system disassociates itself from the image which the judge, by his statements and approach, represents in the mind of a reasonable member of the public,\" wrote the majority. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Parliament considers training for judges NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NDP MP Murray Rankin said that by resigning, Camp took the only course of action available in light of the conclusions of the judicial council. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Rankin added that Camp's case bolsters a private member's bill by interim Conservative leader Rona Ambrose to ensure judges know Canada's sexual assault laws. Parliament voted unanimously this week to send that bill to committee for further study. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ambrose, in a statement welcoming the council's ruling, said her bill was designed to hold the judiciary responsible for the ongoing training of its judges. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Unfortunately, there is not enough accountability on the part of the judiciary in ensuring that judges have the updated training Canadians expect them to have. This needs to change,\" Ambrose said in the statement. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Until Thursday, Camp had fought hard to keep his job. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He asked to speak directly to the 23 chief and associate chief justices who make up the CJC. But the majority said Camp had already \"been fully and fairly heard,\" and declined saying nothing had changed since his public hearing last fall. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Camp then asked the Federal Court to stop the judicial council from deliberating his fate and to review an earlier decision he be dismissed. His lawyer Frank Addario argued the judicial council should consider the fact that Alexander Scott Wager, the man who was accused of sexual assault in the original trial, had once again been acquitted. The judge refused to stall the CJC. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Since the council's creation in 1971, no judge has gone to such lengths to keep his job. There have only been two other cases where the council recommended Parliament remove a judge from the bench and in both cases the men resigned almost immediately. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Just like any other judge facing discipline, Camp's legal battle has been paid for by taxpayers through the Commission for Federal Judicial Affairs, which has refused to say how much it has cost so far. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Four judges dissented from the majority and said Camp should not lose his job because he has rehabilitated himself through counselling and further education.\n\n\nNow, write a one-page summary of all the news.\n\nSummary:", "input": "", "context": "Passage 1:\nA judge has resigned over his conduct of a rape trial in the face of a blistering recommendation for his removal from a national disciplinary body.

The woman was so drunk she had urinated on herself and passed out in the back seat. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Recommendations that judges in effect be fired are rare in the Canadian system, which deems judicial independence a cornerstone. Justice Camp is only the third judge whose removal has been recommended since the judicial council was established in 1971. Both of the others also resigned rather than be removed under a provision of the Constitution that requires Parliament to approve dismissing a judge. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Justice Camp\u2019s comments came in the trial of Alexander Wagar in Calgary. The ruling came to light a year later, when the Alberta Court of Appeal overturned it, saying the judge had applied myths and stereotypes about sexual-assault victims. (By then, the Conservative government of Stephen Harper had promoted him from provincial court.) The judicial council received scores of complaints. Alberta Justice Minister Kathleen Ganley asked for the public disciplinary hearing. \u201cOn reviewing the transcripts, I felt it was important that victims know this was not an acceptable way to be treated by the justice system,\u201d Ms. Ganley said in an e-mail to The Globe after Justice Camp resigned. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Justice Camp, a father of three, received his law degree in 1975 from Stellenbosch University in South Africa, passed exams in Canada in 1998 and was admitted to the Alberta bar in 1999.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In a ruling announced Thursday afternoon, the Canadian Judicial Council (CJC) said that at a 2014 sexual assault trial he was presiding over, Camp \"showed obvious disdain for some of the characteristics of the regime enacted by Parliament in respect of sexual assault issues.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We find that the judge's conduct, viewed in its totality and in light of all of its consequences, was so manifestly and profoundly destructive of the concept of impartiality, integrity and independence of the judicial role that public confidence is sufficiently undermined to render the judge incapable of executing the judicial office,\" the council's ruling reads. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In a statement from his lawyer, Camp announced his intention to resign and apologized. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I have advised Chief Justice Crampton that effective March 10, 2017, I will resign as a member of the Federal Court of Canada,\" the statement read. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I would like to express my sincere apology to everyone who was hurt by my comments during the [sex assault] trial.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The statements made by Justice Camp during the trial and in his decision, the values implicit in those statements and the way in which he conducted himself are so antithetical to the contemporary values of our judicial system with respect to the manner in which complainants in sexual assault cases should be treated that, in our view, confidence in the system cannot be maintained unless the system disassociates itself from the image which the judge, by his statements and approach, represents in the mind of a reasonable member of the public,\" wrote the majority. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Parliament considers training for judges NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NDP MP Murray Rankin said that by resigning, Camp took the only course of action available in light of the conclusions of the judicial council. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Rankin added that Camp's case bolsters a private member's bill by interim Conservative leader Rona Ambrose to ensure judges know Canada's sexual assault laws. Parliament voted unanimously this week to send that bill to committee for further study. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ambrose, in a statement welcoming the council's ruling, said her bill was designed to hold the judiciary responsible for the ongoing training of its judges. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Unfortunately, there is not enough accountability on the part of the judiciary in ensuring that judges have the updated training Canadians expect them to have. This needs to change,\" Ambrose said in the statement. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Until Thursday, Camp had fought hard to keep his job. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He asked to speak directly to the 23 chief and associate chief justices who make up the CJC. But the majority said Camp had already \"been fully and fairly heard,\" and declined saying nothing had changed since his public hearing last fall. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Camp then asked the Federal Court to stop the judicial council from deliberating his fate and to review an earlier decision he be dismissed. His lawyer Frank Addario argued the judicial council should consider the fact that Alexander Scott Wager, the man who was accused of sexual assault in the original trial, had once again been acquitted. The judge refused to stall the CJC. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Since the council's creation in 1971, no judge has gone to such lengths to keep his job. There have only been two other cases where the council recommended Parliament remove a judge from the bench and in both cases the men resigned almost immediately.

{"prompt": "You are given several news passages. Write a one-page summary of all news. \n\nNews:\nPassage 1:\nAntarctic notothenioid fishes are protected from freezing by antifreeze proteins (AFPs) that bind to invading ice crystals and inhibit their growth. Paradoxically, accumulation of AFP-stabilized ice could be lethal. Whether and how fishes eliminate internal ice is unknown; one hypothesis is that it melts during summer warming episodes. However, prior in vitro evidence indicates that AFPs also inhibit melting. Our study establishes that pronounced melting inhibition occurs in vivo (i.e., superheated ice occurs inside notothenioid fishes). Our long-term temperature record of a high-latitude Antarctic fish habitat indicates that summer warming does not overcome AFP-induced superheating to reliably rid fishes of ice. Evolution of the life-saving AFPs exacts a cost: the risk of lifelong accumulation of damaging internal ice crystals. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Abstract NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Antifreeze proteins (AFPs) of polar marine teleost fishes are widely recognized as an evolutionary innovation of vast adaptive value in that, by adsorbing to and inhibiting the growth of internalized environmental ice crystals, they prevent death by inoculative freezing. Paradoxically, systemic accumulation of AFP-stabilized ice could also be lethal. Whether or how fishes eliminate internal ice is unknown. To investigate if ice inside high-latitude Antarctic notothenioid fishes could melt seasonally, we measured its melting point and obtained a decadal temperature record from a shallow benthic fish habitat in McMurdo Sound, Antarctica. We found that AFP-stabilized ice resists melting at temperatures above the expected equilibrium freezing/melting point (eqFMP), both in vitro and in vivo. Superheated ice was directly observed in notothenioid serum samples and in solutions of purified AFPs, and ice was found to persist inside live fishes at temperatures more than 1 \u00b0C above their eqFMP for at least 24 h, and at a lower temperature for at least several days. Field experiments confirmed that superheated ice occurs naturally inside wild fishes. Over the long-term record (1999\u20132012), seawater temperature surpassed the fish eqFMP in most summers, but never exceeded the highest temperature at which ice persisted inside experimental fishes. Thus, because of the effects of AFP-induced melting inhibition, summer warming may not reliably eliminate internal ice. Our results expose a potentially antagonistic pleiotropic effect of AFPs: beneficial freezing avoidance is accompanied by melting inhibition that may contribute to lifelong accumulation of detrimental internal ice crystals.\nPassage 2:\nEUGENE, Ore., Sept. 23 (UPI) -- Fish species that make their home in the frigid waters of Antarctica have developed special antifreeze proteins that keep their blood from icing over. But evolution is a strange game in which seemingly every adaptive trait comes with a trade-off, and for the fish of Antarctica that trade-off is quite the paradox. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For the benefit of avoiding frozen blood, Antarctic notothenioid fish species must tolerate ice in their veins. That's right, the same antifreeze proteins that latch onto ice crystals and prevent them from growing also inhibit them from melting. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A team of marine biologists discovered the odd trade-off while studying the coping mechanisms of notothenioid species living in supremely cold conditions. They discovered the antifreeze proteins' anti-melting properties after raising water temperatures slightly above the freezing point and still finding some ice in the blood of the fish specimens. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We discovered what appears to be an undesirable consequence of the evolution of antifreeze proteins in Antarctic notothenioid fishes,\" study author Paul Cziko, a doctoral student the University of Oregon's Institute of Ecology and Evolution, said in a press release. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If water temperature rises more than two or three degrees above the freezing point, these ice crystals are likely to melt. But Cziko and his colleagues at the University of Illinois found that ocean temperatures in the Antarctic rarely ever rose high enough to help clean the species icy veins. That means these fish carry ice crystals around with them for most of their lives -- a risky proposition that could help them stay cool under pressure but could also cause a life-threatening traffic jam inside small capillaries. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Since much of the ice accumulates in the fishes' spleens, we think there may be a mechanism to clear the ice from the circulation,\" Cziko added. \"This is just one more piece in the puzzle of how notothenioids came to dominate the ocean around Antarctica.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The study was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences on Monday.\nPassage 3:\nScientists long have known that antifreeze proteins help a species of Antarctic fish survive in frigid waters. Now research has found that these proteins also prevent some fish from ever ridding themselves of the ice in their bodies. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The notothenioid fish uses evolutionary mechanisms to survive in anchor ice that exists on the sea floors of the Antarctic region. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Even after being studied for decades, the notothenioid, a bony fish that thrives in frigid waters, continues to hold surprises. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Notothenioids own the waters circling Antarctica known as the Southern Ocean; one of the few species that can survive in seawater temperatures as low as 29 degrees Fahrenheit, it makes up more than 90 percent of the fish biomass in the region. It's no wonder, then, that scientists began to investigate how these animals thrive in this icy environment without freezing over. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Scientists have been revealing startling facts about the notothenioid for more than four decades now, including the discovery, in the 1960s, of antifreeze proteins inside these fishes, a vital tool for their survival. But according to a new study published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, researchers have revealed that these proteins may not be as helpful as they were once thought to be. The proteins do indeed help prevent water from freezing in the fish, but it turns out they also prevent ice from melting. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We've known for a long time that the antifreeze proteins are at the essence of how these fishes survive in their freezing environment. But we're still working out the details, and this is one of those details,\" Paul Cziko, lead author of the paper, told the Monitor. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mr. Cziko, a doctoral candidate at the University of Oregon, worked with Christina Cheng and Arthur DeVries, a husband-and-wife team of animal biologists at the University of Illinois. Devries revealed in the late 1960s that antifreeze proteins existed in the bodies of notothenioids. In the 1990s, he discovered that the fishes were also carrying ice crystals in various organs, such as the gills and the spleen. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In this new study, Cziko's team tested fish in the lab by warming them to a point at which the ice in their bodies completely melted. These were temperatures, though, that the notothenioid never experiences in its own environment. They also examined temperature data logged continuously over the last 11 years in McMurdo Sound, Antarctica. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The research group found that the ice crystals didn't melt at their expected melting point of about 30 degrees Fahrenheit, but instead remained intact. The fish continued to contain ice even after researchers raised the temperature further another 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit, and this was primarily due to the antifreeze protein. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Though the life-saving protein was given the name \"antifreeze,\" it works differently from, say, the liquid you mix with your windshield wiper fluid, according to Cziko. Rather than acting like a salt and lowering the freezing point, the notothenioids' antifreeze proteins bind themselves to the ice crystals in their bodies and alter the surface of the crystals so that they have a hard time growing any larger. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This mechanism doesn't just make it very hard for the ice crystals to grow, though. The proteins bind themselves so tightly that they also make it difficult for the ice to get any smaller, even in above-freezing temperatures. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"When people are studying antifreeze proteins they're looking at the ability of the organisms to deal with cold temperatures and not warm temperatures,\" says Cziko. \"All their focus is towards 'How much does it protect against freezing?' and people just kind of missed that there could also be an anti-melting effect that's important.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In controlled settings, scientists have been able to heat ice above its melting point without having the ice melt. But Cziko says this may be the first example of \"superheating\" found in nature. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR So what does this superheated ice mean for the fish? Even in the slightly warmer summer months when the notothenioid has a chance to thaw out, some ice crystals linger. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Whether or not there are any adverse effects on the fishes' bodies is still unknown. The long-term cost of having the protein, Cziko says, is a question for further research. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"If they can tolerate it, maybe they've evolved some other mechanism to deal with these ice crystals inside their bodies,\" says Cziko. \"And maybe in the long-term it does kill the fish and they're not that good at dealing with it.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The highest concentration of ice crystals resided in the fishes' spleens. Cziko says it's possible that the spleen is trying to filter these ice crystals out of the blood to prevent their causing problems in other parts of the body. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cziko also says research on this particular evolutionary puzzle provides us with a better understanding of the progression of all species. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"This shows that with every good evolutionary innovation, some potentially bad or unintended consequences come along with that,\" says Cziko \"Evolution is a stepwise process. You take two steps forward, and take one step back.\"\n\n\nNow, write a one-page summary of all the news.\n\nSummary:", "input": "", "context": "Passage 1:\nAntarctic notothenioid fishes are protected from freezing by antifreeze proteins (AFPs) that bind to invading ice crystals and inhibit their growth.

Field experiments confirmed that superheated ice occurs naturally inside wild fishes. Over the long-term record (1999\u20132012), seawater temperature surpassed the fish eqFMP in most summers, but never exceeded the highest temperature at which ice persisted inside experimental fishes. Thus, because of the effects of AFP-induced melting inhibition, summer warming may not reliably eliminate internal ice. Our results expose a potentially antagonistic pleiotropic effect of AFPs: beneficial freezing avoidance is accompanied by melting inhibition that may contribute to lifelong accumulation of detrimental internal ice crystals.\nPassage 2:\nEUGENE, Ore., Sept. 23 (UPI) -- Fish species that make their home in the frigid waters of Antarctica have developed special antifreeze proteins that keep their blood from icing over. But evolution is a strange game in which seemingly every adaptive trait comes with a trade-off, and for the fish of Antarctica that trade-off is quite the paradox. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For the benefit of avoiding frozen blood, Antarctic notothenioid fish species must tolerate ice in their veins. That's right, the same antifreeze proteins that latch onto ice crystals and prevent them from growing also inhibit them from melting. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A team of marine biologists discovered the odd trade-off while studying the coping mechanisms of notothenioid species living in supremely cold conditions. They discovered the antifreeze proteins' anti-melting properties after raising water temperatures slightly above the freezing point and still finding some ice in the blood of the fish specimens. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We discovered what appears to be an undesirable consequence of the evolution of antifreeze proteins in Antarctic notothenioid fishes,\" study author Paul Cziko, a doctoral student the University of Oregon's Institute of Ecology and Evolution, said in a press release. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If water temperature rises more than two or three degrees above the freezing point, these ice crystals are likely to melt. But Cziko and his colleagues at the University of Illinois found that ocean temperatures in the Antarctic rarely ever rose high enough to help clean the species icy veins. That means these fish carry ice crystals around with them for most of their lives -- a risky proposition that could help them stay cool under pressure but could also cause a life-threatening traffic jam inside small capillaries. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Since much of the ice accumulates in the fishes' spleens, we think there may be a mechanism to clear the ice from the circulation,\" Cziko added. \"This is just one more piece in the puzzle of how notothenioids came to dominate the ocean around Antarctica.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The study was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences on Monday.\nPassage 3:\nScientists long have known that antifreeze proteins help a species of Antarctic fish survive in frigid waters. Now research has found that these proteins also prevent some fish from ever ridding themselves of the ice in their bodies. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The notothenioid fish uses evolutionary mechanisms to survive in anchor ice that exists on the sea floors of the Antarctic region. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Even after being studied for decades, the notothenioid, a bony fish that thrives in frigid waters, continues to hold surprises. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Notothenioids own the waters circling Antarctica known as the Southern Ocean; one of the few species that can survive in seawater temperatures as low as 29 degrees Fahrenheit, it makes up more than 90 percent of the fish biomass in the region. It's no wonder, then, that scientists began to investigate how these animals thrive in this icy environment without freezing over. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Scientists have been revealing startling facts about the notothenioid for more than four decades now, including the discovery, in the 1960s, of antifreeze proteins inside these fishes, a vital tool for their survival. But according to a new study published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, researchers have revealed that these proteins may not be as helpful as they were once thought to be. The proteins do indeed help prevent water from freezing in the fish, but it turns out they also prevent ice from melting. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We've known for a long time that the antifreeze proteins are at the essence of how these fishes survive in their freezing environment. But we're still working out the details, and this is one of those details,\" Paul Cziko, lead author of the paper, told the Monitor. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mr. Cziko, a doctoral candidate at the University of Oregon, worked with Christina Cheng and Arthur DeVries, a husband-and-wife team of animal biologists at the University of Illinois. Devries revealed in the late 1960s that antifreeze proteins existed in the bodies of notothenioids. In the 1990s, he discovered that the fishes were also carrying ice crystals in various organs, such as the gills and the spleen. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In this new study, Cziko's team tested fish in the lab by warming them to a point at which the ice in their bodies completely melted. These were temperatures, though, that the notothenioid never experiences in its own environment. They also examined temperature data logged continuously over the last 11 years in McMurdo Sound, Antarctica. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The research group found that the ice crystals didn't melt at their expected melting point of about 30 degrees Fahrenheit, but instead remained intact. The fish continued to contain ice even after researchers raised the temperature further another 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit, and this was primarily due to the antifreeze protein. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Though the life-saving protein was given the name \"antifreeze,\" it works differently from, say, the liquid you mix with your windshield wiper fluid, according to Cziko. Rather than acting like a salt and lowering the freezing point, the notothenioids' antifreeze proteins bind themselves to the ice crystals in their bodies and alter the surface of the crystals so that they have a hard time growing any larger. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This mechanism doesn't just make it very hard for the ice crystals to grow, though. The proteins bind themselves so tightly that they also make it difficult for the ice to get any smaller, even in above-freezing temperatures. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"When people are studying antifreeze proteins they're looking at the ability of the organisms to deal with cold temperatures and not warm temperatures,\" says Cziko. \"All their focus is towards 'How much does it protect against freezing?' and people just kind of missed that there could also be an anti-melting effect that's important.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In controlled settings, scientists have been able to heat ice above its melting point without having the ice melt. But Cziko says this may be the first example of \"superheating\" found in nature. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR So what does this superheated ice mean for the fish? Even in the slightly warmer summer months when the notothenioid has a chance to thaw out, some ice crystals linger. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Whether or not there are any adverse effects on the fishes' bodies is still unknown. The long-term cost of having the protein, Cziko says, is a question for further research. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"If they can tolerate it, maybe they've evolved some other mechanism to deal with these ice crystals inside their bodies,\" says Cziko. \"And maybe in the long-term it does kill the fish and they're not that good at dealing with it.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The highest concentration of ice crystals resided in the fishes' spleens. Cziko says it's possible that the spleen is trying to filter these ice crystals out of the blood to prevent their causing problems in other parts of the body. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cziko also says research on this particular evolutionary puzzle provides us with a better understanding of the progression of all species. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"This shows that with every good evolutionary innovation, some potentially bad or unintended consequences come along with that,\" says Cziko \"Evolution is a stepwise process. You take two steps forward, and take one step back.\"\n", "answers": ["How do the fish that thrive in the waters around Antarctica prevent their blood from turning to ice? Turns out at least some of them don't. Scientists have long known that the group of fish species known as notothenioids have an antifreeze protein in their blood that prevents them from being frozen to death, but new research has revealed that the same protein keeps ice crystals in their veins, apparently permanently, UPI reports. The crystals melted at a few degrees above freezing, but the fish may spend their whole lives without encountering temperatures that warm, according to research published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The antifreeze proteins that prevented the blood from completely freezing also bound itself to the ice crystals, keeping them from getting smaller, the scientists say. Lead researcher Paul Cziko tells the Christian Science Monitor that it's not clear whether the fish have evolved some way of dealing with the ice crystals in their bodies, or if the ice ends up killing them in the long term. \"This shows that with every good evolutionary innovation, some potentially bad or unintended consequences come along with that,\" he says. \"Evolution is a stepwise process.

Bowers had been wounded during a shoot-out with police. Two of the men who treated him at Allegheny General were themselves Jewish. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The president of the hospital, Dr. Jeff Cohen, was a member of the Tree of Life synagogue. Cohen told the media last week that two of the people who treated Bowers were Jewish: the ER doctor, and a registered nurse. Cohen described Bowers as \u201clost\u201d and said that the registered nurse, a young man, broke down in tears after treating him. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Now the nurse has come forward with an emotional Facebook post about his experience treating Bowers. His name is Ari Mahler. Here\u2019s what you need to know: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 1. Mahler Says Bowers Yelled \u2018Death to All Jews\u2019 as He Was Wheeled Into the Emergency Room NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mahler wrote that Robert Bowers didn\u2019t seem evil \u2014 instead, Mahler said, the alleged shooter seemed confused and lost. Mahler speculated that Bowers was a lonely, easily-led man who had been influenced by others. The nurse wrote, NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cI didn\u2019t see evil when I looked into Robert Bowers\u2019 eyes. All I saw was a clear lack of depth, intelligence, and palpable amounts of confusion. Robert Bowers probably had no friends, was easily influenced by propaganda, and wanted attention on a sociopathic level. He\u2019s the kind of person that is easily manipulated by people with a microphone, a platform, and use fear for motivation.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mahler said that he never told Bowers that he was Jewish. He said he didn\u2019t want to go into detail about his interactions with Bowers, but he did say that the suspect thanked him for his kindness and for saving his life. Mahler wrote that he treated Bowers just the same way as he treats all of his patients. But he also wrote that, as Bowers was being wheeled into the emergency room, he yelled, \u201cDeath to all Jews!\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jeff Cohen, the president of Allegheny General Hospital, said that after Bowers\u2019 treatment Mahler came to him in tears, overwhelmed by what had just taken place. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 2. Mahler\u2019s Father Is a Retired Rabbi NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mahler\u2019s father is Rabbi Mark Joel Mahler, who served as the rabbi of Temple Emanuel, a reform synagogue in South Hills, from 1980 until 2018. Rabbi Mahler retired in June of 2018. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The rabbi was known for his use of music; he played guitar and sang during Sabbath services, and he led the synagogue\u2019s band. Several of his children (not Ari) also participated in the band. Rabbi Mahler was also a member of the South Hills Interfaith Ministries and the National Conference of Christian and Jews. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Rabbi Mahler and his wife Alice have four children: Ari, Shoshana, Moshe, and Shira. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 3. Mahler Says He Often Experienced Anti-Semitism Growing Up NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ari Mahler wrote that he was not shocked by the Pittsburgh shooting; the Pittsburgh native says that anti-Semitism is nothing new for him. As a boy, he says, he often experienced bullying because he was Jewish. He described finding swastikas scrawled on his locker at school, or finding pictures of his family being sent to the gas chamber. And, Mahler writes, he never managed to confront the bullying head-on: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cI experienced anti-Semitism a lot as a kid. It\u2019s hard for me to say if it was always a product of genuine hatred, or if kids with their own problems found a reason to single me out from others. Sure, there were a few Jewish kids at my school, but no one else had a father who was a Rabbi. I found drawings on desks of my family being marched into gas chambers, swastikas drawn on my locker, and notes shoved inside of it saying, \u201cDie Jew. Love, Hitler.\u201d It was a different time back then, where bullying was not monitored like it is now. I was weak, too. Rather than tell anyone, I hid behind fear. Telling on the people who did this would only lead to consequences far worse.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mahler also says that he developed defense mechanisms to shield himself from anti-Semites. He got into the habit of telling people that he isn\u2019t very religious. Mahler wrote that even people who view Judaism positively often seem to feel uncomfortable when they meet Jewish people. And so, he says, he\u2019s learned over the years how to ease awkward moments by deflecting attention from his Jewishness. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 4. Mahler Worked as a Financial Consultant Before Going to Work as a Nurse NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ari Mahler was an honors student at the University of Maryland, graduating in 1999 with a BA in English. Mahler went on to work as a loan officer for American Equity, and then as a financial consultant for PNC. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Then, in 2013, Mahler enrolled at the University of Pittsburgh\u2019s School of Nursing, again earning honors and graduating the next year as a registered nurse. Mahler found work as a registered nurse at Magee Women\u2019s Hospital; he switched to working at Allegheny General in March of 2018. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 5. Mahler Concluded His Facebook Post With a Plea for Love in the Face of Evil NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mahler wrote movingly about his decision to treat Bowers with \u201ccompassion\u201d and \u201cempathy.\u201d He wrote that he never told Bowers that he was Jewish, and just treated him with the same care that he would use on any patient. He wrote, \u201cI wanted him to feel compassion. I chose to show him empathy. I felt that the best way to honor his victims was for a Jew to prove him wrong.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mahler wrapped up his Facebook post with a plea. He wrote, NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cLove as an action is more powerful than words, and love in the face of evil gives others hope. It demonstrates humanity. It reaffirms why we\u2019re all here. The meaning of life is to give meaning to life, and love is the ultimate force that connects all living beings.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cHe\u2019s a very lost guy,\u201d Cohen told the Tribune-Review. \u201cIt\u2019s just my impression. It\u2019s not based on fact. I mean, he\u2019s coming off the ambulance yelling \u2018kill all the Jews\u2019 and those are the people treating him. That is the height of stupidity.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Two of the lead people who immediately treated Bowers at Allegheny General were Jewish, Cohen said. They include the attending emergency room doctor and a registered nurse whose own father is a rabbi, he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cohen declined to name them but praised them for honoring their profession by putting their emotions aside. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cIt\u2019s hard. You have this internal debate with yourself. Am I going to do what is right? And you do. You do what you think is right,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cThe mission here is taking care of people. They didn\u2019t ask anything about him. He was a patient.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Not long after treating Bowers, the young nurse broke down in tears. Cohen met with him for about 20 minutes and thanked him for doing his job. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cHe was pretty broken,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cI told him how proud I was. He went home and hugged his parents.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cohen, 63, lives about 50 yards from the Tree of Life Congregation where the mass shooting occurred. He was home on Saturday morning when he heard a loud noise outside. Within minutes, his daughter yelled to him to come downstairs and they watched as police and SWAT teams descended on their street. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He described the congregation as a safe place where people gather daily to pray and socialize. His own mother-in-law attends services nearly every day and knew nine of the 11 people who were killed. Cohen knew them, too, pausing to mention Cecil and David Rosenthal, two brothers killed in the massacre. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cThe Rosenthal brothers were both handicapped. They were very comfortable there. This is the Jewish version of \u2018Cheers.\u2019 Everybody knew their names. This was their home,\u201d Cohen said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cohen, who has been president of Allegheny General Hospital for two years, said that on Sunday night he became more and more curious about meeting Bowers. The suspect was being treated for gunshot wounds and had been placed in isolation to allow police to guard him while he received treatment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cI just wanted to see him with my own eyes,\u201d he said. \u201cHe had a mother once, or maybe still does. He was loved by a family. How do you get from here to there? I wanted to have my own impression.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR His conclusion: \u201cHe\u2019s not the face of the devil. He\u2019s just a guy who committed a very heinous act.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Luis F\u00e1bregas is editor of the Tribune-Review\u2019s Valley News Dispatch and Pittsburgh digital editions.

Bowers had been wounded during a shoot-out with police. Two of the men who treated him at Allegheny General were themselves Jewish. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The president of the hospital, Dr. Jeff Cohen, was a member of the Tree of Life synagogue. Cohen told the media last week that two of the people who treated Bowers were Jewish: the ER doctor, and a registered nurse. Cohen described Bowers as \u201clost\u201d and said that the registered nurse, a young man, broke down in tears after treating him. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Now the nurse has come forward with an emotional Facebook post about his experience treating Bowers. His name is Ari Mahler. Here\u2019s what you need to know: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 1. Mahler Says Bowers Yelled \u2018Death to All Jews\u2019 as He Was Wheeled Into the Emergency Room NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mahler wrote that Robert Bowers didn\u2019t seem evil \u2014 instead, Mahler said, the alleged shooter seemed confused and lost. Mahler speculated that Bowers was a lonely, easily-led man who had been influenced by others. The nurse wrote, NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cI didn\u2019t see evil when I looked into Robert Bowers\u2019 eyes. All I saw was a clear lack of depth, intelligence, and palpable amounts of confusion. Robert Bowers probably had no friends, was easily influenced by propaganda, and wanted attention on a sociopathic level. He\u2019s the kind of person that is easily manipulated by people with a microphone, a platform, and use fear for motivation.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mahler said that he never told Bowers that he was Jewish. He said he didn\u2019t want to go into detail about his interactions with Bowers, but he did say that the suspect thanked him for his kindness and for saving his life. Mahler wrote that he treated Bowers just the same way as he treats all of his patients. But he also wrote that, as Bowers was being wheeled into the emergency room, he yelled, \u201cDeath to all Jews!\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jeff Cohen, the president of Allegheny General Hospital, said that after Bowers\u2019 treatment Mahler came to him in tears, overwhelmed by what had just taken place. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 2. Mahler\u2019s Father Is a Retired Rabbi NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mahler\u2019s father is Rabbi Mark Joel Mahler, who served as the rabbi of Temple Emanuel, a reform synagogue in South Hills, from 1980 until 2018. Rabbi Mahler retired in June of 2018. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The rabbi was known for his use of music; he played guitar and sang during Sabbath services, and he led the synagogue\u2019s band. Several of his children (not Ari) also participated in the band. Rabbi Mahler was also a member of the South Hills Interfaith Ministries and the National Conference of Christian and Jews. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Rabbi Mahler and his wife Alice have four children: Ari, Shoshana, Moshe, and Shira. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 3. Mahler Says He Often Experienced Anti-Semitism Growing Up NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ari Mahler wrote that he was not shocked by the Pittsburgh shooting; the Pittsburgh native says that anti-Semitism is nothing new for him. As a boy, he says, he often experienced bullying because he was Jewish. He described finding swastikas scrawled on his locker at school, or finding pictures of his family being sent to the gas chamber. And, Mahler writes, he never managed to confront the bullying head-on: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cI experienced anti-Semitism a lot as a kid. It\u2019s hard for me to say if it was always a product of genuine hatred, or if kids with their own problems found a reason to single me out from others. Sure, there were a few Jewish kids at my school, but no one else had a father who was a Rabbi. I found drawings on desks of my family being marched into gas chambers, swastikas drawn on my locker, and notes shoved inside of it saying, \u201cDie Jew. Love, Hitler.\u201d It was a different time back then, where bullying was not monitored like it is now. I was weak, too. Rather than tell anyone, I hid behind fear. Telling on the people who did this would only lead to consequences far worse.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mahler also says that he developed defense mechanisms to shield himself from anti-Semites. He got into the habit of telling people that he isn\u2019t very religious. Mahler wrote that even people who view Judaism positively often seem to feel uncomfortable when they meet Jewish people. And so, he says, he\u2019s learned over the years how to ease awkward moments by deflecting attention from his Jewishness. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 4. Mahler Worked as a Financial Consultant Before Going to Work as a Nurse NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ari Mahler was an honors student at the University of Maryland, graduating in 1999 with a BA in English. Mahler went on to work as a loan officer for American Equity, and then as a financial consultant for PNC. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Then, in 2013, Mahler enrolled at the University of Pittsburgh\u2019s School of Nursing, again earning honors and graduating the next year as a registered nurse. Mahler found work as a registered nurse at Magee Women\u2019s Hospital; he switched to working at Allegheny General in March of 2018. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 5. Mahler Concluded His Facebook Post With a Plea for Love in the Face of Evil NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mahler wrote movingly about his decision to treat Bowers with \u201ccompassion\u201d and \u201cempathy.\u201d He wrote that he never told Bowers that he was Jewish, and just treated him with the same care that he would use on any patient. He wrote, \u201cI wanted him to feel compassion. I chose to show him empathy. I felt that the best way to honor his victims was for a Jew to prove him wrong.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mahler wrapped up his Facebook post with a plea. He wrote, NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cLove as an action is more powerful than words, and love in the face of evil gives others hope. It demonstrates humanity. It reaffirms why we\u2019re all here. The meaning of life is to give meaning to life, and love is the ultimate force that connects all living beings. I could care less what Robert Bowers thinks, but you, the person reading this, love is the only message I wish to instill in you. If my actions mean anything, love means everything.\u201d\n", "answers": ["An Allegheny General Hospital nurse who treated Robert Bowers, the man suspected of killing 11 at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh, after the shooting has stepped forward via a public Facebook post, and he clarifies his identity: \"I am The Jewish Nurse.\" His name is Ari Mahler, and per TribLIVE, he and an ER doctor were two Jewish medical professionals who tended to Bowers, even after he was reportedly wheeled into the hospital yelling, \"Death to all Jews.\" In his post, Mahler doesn't get into too many specifics about his interaction with Bowers, citing privacy laws, but he reveals how as a kid\u2014he was one of four children of a rabbi, per Heavy.com\u2014he dealt with anti-Semitism, and that even as an adult he plays his religion down as a deflection. He notes he didn't tell Bowers he was Jewish, instead choosing to \"show him empathy.\" And also \"love.\" \"I could care less what Robert Bowers thinks, but you, the person reading this, love is the only message I wish [to] instill in you,\" he writes. Mahler, who initially worried his own parents could've been among the synagogue victims, says what happened didn't shock him and that \"it\u2019s only a matter of time before the next one happens,\" adding although \"my heart yearns for change \u2026 today's climate doesn't foster nurturing, tolerance, or civility.\" He also notes he didn't see \"evil\" when he looked into Bowers' eyes, but \"something else.\" Hospital President Jeff Cohen, who said Mahler came to him in tears after treating Bowers, concurs. \"He's a very lost guy,\" Cohen says of Bowers, per TribLIVE, but \"he's not the face of the devil.

(Associated Press) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The harshness of the sentences and the scenes a day earlier were new signs that the military-backed government is becoming bolder in silencing dissent, turning to abuses reminiscent of the Hosni Mubarak era. Authorities have been justifying tougher measures as needed to fight terrorism and bring stability _ while they also appear to be exploiting divisions among secular democracy activists. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The crackdown is rearranging Egypt's political map after months when authorities were focused on crippling the Muslim Brotherhood and other Islamist backers of ousted President Mohammed Morsi. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This week, security forces have moved against secular youth activists opposed to the military and police. Some government supporters warn that its actions are widening the base of the opposition and could bring together Morsi supporters and the secular activists, though they bitterly oppose the Islamists and Morsi as equally authoritarian. The crisis is fragmenting the loose coalition of liberal and secular groups that supported the military in its July 3 removal of Morsi. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In a Mediterranean city of Alexandria courtroom, the 21 young female defendants flashed defiant smiles to the media, standing handcuffed in white head scarves and white prison uniforms in the defendants cage. They were convicted on charges related to holding an Oct. 31 protest in the city demanding Morsi's reinstatement. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Among them were seven teenagers aged 15 and 16, who were sentenced to prison terms until they turn 18. The rest _ most aged 18 to 22 _ were sentenced to 11 years in prison. Six other Brotherhood members were sentenced to 15 years in prison for inciting the demonstrations. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We thought they will get a month or something but we were shocked with the 11 years,\" defense lawyer al-Shimaa Ibrahim Saad said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Muslim Brotherhood's political arm, the Freedom and Justice Party, said the sentences are meant to be a \"deterrent\" for the group's opposition to the military, vowing the verdict \"will only increase the determination of the people to get their rights.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Meanwhile, hundreds of secular youth activists protested Wednesday in downtown Cairo against the government's clampdown on dissent. At the center of the crisis is the law issued this week banning any protests or public political gatherings of more than 10 people without a prior police permit, imposing stiff fines and jail terms for violators. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Those thinking the authoritarian pharaonic style works will find it doesn't anymore,\" said one protester, Laila Soueif. \"There will be a third wave of the revolution much more violent than before. We are witnessing a turning point.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A day earlier, security forces broke up two small activists' protests in Cairo. Security forces beat and dragged women protesters outside parliament. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The images were reminiscent of the days of Mubarak, the autocrat who ruled the country for nearly 30 years and was ousted in a 2011 uprising. Under his rule, police at times focused on humiliating female protesters. Similarly, under the rule of the military that followed his ouster, police broke up an anti-military protest, half-stripping a female protester and stomping on her chest. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After breaking up Tuesday's protest, police detained 14 women, then drove them in a van through the desert where they were dropped off on a remote road in the middle of the night, several of the women said. That too is a tactic used by Mubarak-era police to intimidate protesters. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"They want to terrorize us,\" said Mona Seif, a prominent activist who was among the 14 women. \"I think the interior minister decided to escalate and tell everyone whose family was killed... beaten or anything that I am here, this is how I do business, and if you don't like it, beat your head against the wall.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the face of the criticism, the Cabinet issued a strongly worded statement saying it is determined to implement the new protest law with \"all firmness and force ... so freedom doesn't turn to chaos.\" It linked it to a \"war on terrorism\" _ pointing to the Brotherhood protests and violence by Islamic militants in Sinai. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"There are elements that want to spread domestic chaos in a desperate attempt to hurt the prestige of the state,\" it said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The law comes ahead of an election season that will include a referendum on amendments to the Islamist-drafted, Morsi-era constitution. Authorities have shown they are eager to push through the new charter _ but they could face troubles in the January vote on two fronts. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Secular activists oppose the document because of wider powers it gives the military and the president. The Brotherhood rejects the entire amendment process _ along with the new government in general _ and although it has been weakened by a crackdown, it has kept up protests for over 20 weeks and can still mobilize against the document. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Wednesday, the prosecutor general's office ordered 24 people who were arrested in Tuesday's activist protest to be held for four days for questioning on possible charges of violating the protest law. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In a statement, the prosecutors office accused the protesters of \"chanting antagonistic slogans against the state\" and refusing to end their rally. It said the demonstration \"disturbed traffic and affected citizens' interests,\" terms mentioned in the protest law as violations justifying police action. It also accused them of attacking a police officer and taking his telephone. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The prosecutor also ordered the arrests of Alaa Abdel-Fattah and Ahmed Maher, two top activists, on suspicion of inciting others to break the protest law, the state news agency MENA said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In a sign of the Islamists' eagerness to find a common cause with secular activists, the Brotherhood-led coalition supporting Morsi reached out to them Wednesday with a statement denouncing \"brutal repression\" of the protests the day before, saying the \"youth of the revolution stand united.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The spokesman of the Muslim Brotherhood-led coalition, Diaa al-Sawi, said he will contact youth activists to coordinate rallies. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR They met a quick rejection, however, from the youth activists, who joined the massive anti-Morsi protests that preceded his ouster. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"A message to the Muslim Brotherhood: we will not put our hands in the hands of those who betrayed and hijacked the revolution,\" said Hossam Moanis, spokesman of one activist group, the Popular Current.\nPassage 2:\nCairo (CNN) -- Police on Monday arrested the head of the defense team for the 21 women and girls sentenced for protesting in Egypt last month, a colleague and member of the defense team told CNN.

Nasser El-Abd, the head of the Alexandria Criminal Investigation Department, told Egyptian daily newspaper Al-Masry Al-Youm that El-Hamrawy was arrested with five others for \"incitement of violence.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Reports: Egypt's draft constitution goes to interim president NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Wednesday, 14 women were sentenced to 11 years in prison, and seven minors to juvenile detention, on charges of gathering, thuggery and weapons possession at a demonstration for ousted President Mohamed Morsy. The harsh sentence sparked wide criticism of the way the Interior Ministry and the judiciary have been handling the cases of Morsy supporters. An appeals hearing for their case is scheduled to take place Saturday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We don't have any doubt that this verdict is a new episode in a series of politicized judicial rulings, which include the sentencing of several Al-Azhar students to 17 years for various misdemeanors based on accusations that are mostly trumped up and generalized,\" said a joint statement issued by 14 rights groups last week. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Egyptian lawmakers begin vote on new constitution NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The verdict coincided with an increasing crackdown on non-Islamist activists who oppose the military-led regime and Morsy. Prominent activist Alaa Abdel-Fattah, detained during the Mubarak and the military council regimes in 2006 and 2011, is being held pending investigations for his alleged involvement in calling for a demonstration. Ahmed Maher, founder of the April 6 Youth Movement, is also being questioned about similar charges. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Legislation restricting demonstrations reignited confrontations between police and the non-Islamist opposition, especially at university campuses across the country. A demonstration coinciding with the retrial of two policemen accused of killing Khaled Saied, whose death had fueled the uprising in 2011, was dispersed with force in Alexandria on Monday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"El-Hamrawy was part of Morsy's opposition.

However, this is very personal to me and my family and I want there to be a discussion, which is why we will be screening Vaxxed. I am not personally endorsing the film, nor am I anti-vaccination; I am only providing the opportunity for a conversation around the issue.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Andrew Wakefield, the doctor-turned-documentarian behind Vaxxed: From Cover-up to Catastrophe, argues that vaccinations given to infants could lead to autism, a claim that the Centers for Disease Control has long denied. Wakefield's research papers on the subject have been attacked and discredited, and while his bio page on the Tribeca site mentions his work in the field, it doesn't mention that he's been accused of professional misconduct and falsifying information. Wakefield was also stripped of his medical license. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR De Niro's statement has sparked even more controversy as the actor's decision to include the documentary as part of the film festival that he helped found represents only one side of the anti-vaccination debate. Filmmaker Penny Lane, who made the documentary Nuts! about a snake oil salesman and medical fraud in general, penned an open letter to the Tribeca Film Festival asking them to reconsider the Vaxxed screening. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"While it is true that we documentary filmmakers constantly debate vexing questions about the perceived and real differences between our work and the work of traditional journalism, I assure you that we are not debating whether it is okay to knowingly spread dangerous lies,\" Lane wrote of Wakefield. \"In other words: issues around truth and ethics in documentary can get thorny. But this one should have been easy. The anti-vaccination hoax has been completely discredited by now. This film is not some sort of disinterested investigation into the 'vaccines cause autism' hoax; this film is 'directed by the person who perpetuated the hoax.'\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As of now, Vaxxed is scheduled to screen April 24th at the film festival.\nPassage 2:\nMr. De Niro\u2019s statement seemed to suggest that this was the first time he has expressed a preference that a particular film be shown at the festival.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The trailer for the film, filled with dramatic music, opens with the words \u201cAre Our Children Safe?\u201d on a black screen with billowing smoke that appears to be coming from a syringe. The trailer includes the suggestion that a \u201cwhistle-blower\u201d from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention would say that the organization \u201chad committed fraud\u201d and \u201cthat they knew that vaccines were actually causing autism.\u201d Mr. Wakefield appears in the trailer saying, \u201cWow, the C.D.C. had known all along there was this M.M.R. autism risk.\u201d\nPassage 3:\nThe Tribeca Film Festival is facing serious backlash for including anti-vaccination documentary \u201cVaxxed: From Cover-up to Catastrophe\u201d from doctor-turned-documentarian Andrew Wakefield into its 2016 lineup. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Wakefield is a fervent believer in the link between vaccination and autism. He has also been the subject of many controversies, including being accused of professional misconduct and falsifying information as early as 1998 in one of his research papers. Wakefield\u2019s bio on the festival\u2019s page for the documentary mentions the research paper and study but not that it was later discredited. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Many called for a response about the festival\u2019s decision.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Including the film has prompted some to categorized the festival\u2019s decision as \u201cirresponsible\u201d and called out the film for being \u201cdishonest\u201d and \u201cone-sided\u201d in its message.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Monday, the widely discredited and dangerous anti-vaccination quack Andrew Wakefield tweeted: \u201cHaven\u2019t posted forever. Huge news tomorrow.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Perhaps he hadn\u2019t \u201cposted forever\u201d because the media finally stopped giving him a megaphone. Perhaps once people in America and England began dying of measles, journalists finally realized that the \u201ctwo sides to every story\u201d approach granted Wakefield was literally killing people. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Last I heard, Wakefield was headlining Conspira-Sea, a seven-day cruise where passengers learn about crop circles, chemtrails, yogic flying, ESP and astrology. Good, I thought, that\u2019s where he belongs. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Well, not so fast. It seems the quack is back. Wakefield\u2019s \u201chuge news\u201d is that he is now a documentary film director, and that his new film Vaxxed: From Cover-up to Catastrophe will premiere at the prestigious Tribeca Film Festival this April. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Your film festival guide suggests that if I\u2019m interested in Vaxxed, I might also be interested in the category of \u201cdocumentaries.\u201d Well, as a documentary filmmaker who spent eight years making a film about a quack: yes, Tribeca Film Festival, I am very interested in both your choice to screen Vaxxed and in the field of documentary film. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I have always admired Tribeca\u2019s ambitious and broad documentary programming. I first saw (T)ERROR there, and The Genius of Marian, and Tomorrow We Disappear, and Thank You For Playing, and Give Up Tomorrow, and Let The Fire Burn \u2013 and so many other excellent films. And this is what makes your decision all the more pernicious: audiences have come to expect excellence from your documentary programming. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When The Los Angeles Times contacted you for comment, they received this response: \u201cTribeca, as most film festivals, is about dialogue and discussion. Over the years we have presented many films from opposing sides of an issue. We are a forum, not a judge.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Here is the problem with your statement: it assumes that Vaxxed is just like any other film taking on an unpopular, controversial or provocative subject. It is not. There is a big difference between advocacy and fraud, between point of view and deception. For you to claim there is no difference helps to perpetuate Wakefield\u2019s fraud. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Also, it is disingenuous for you to claim you are not a \u201cjudge.\u201d You are literally judging when you choose a film, from thousands of submissions, to screen under your banner. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A lot of people, including those who buy tickets to see docs at your festival, believe documentary film has become a new and important form of news. But journalists are expected to tell the truth \u2014 or at least not knowingly spread dangerous lies. Your choice to include Vaxxed in your documentary lineup \u2014 a lineup including films about abortion, Syrian refugees, solitary confinement, the American electoral system, in-vitro fertilization and drone warfare \u2014 suggests that you think documentary filmmakers can\u2019t be held even to the latter standard. This threatens the credibility of not just the other filmmakers in your doc slate, but the field in general. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR So yes, I take this personally. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While it is true that we documentary filmmakers constantly debate vexing questions about the perceived and real differences between our work and the work of traditional journalism, I assure you that we are not debating whether it is okay to knowingly spread dangerous lies. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Consider how many lies there are in the first 30 seconds of the Vaxxed trailer. Wakefield\u2019s cinematic disregard of the truth means his film should not be called a documentary any more than Loose Change is. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In other words: issues around truth and ethics in documentary can get thorny. But this one is easy. This film is not some sort of disinterested investigation into the \u201cvaccines cause autism\u201d hoax; this film is directed by the person who perpetuated the hoax. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And this hoax isn\u2019t cute, or fun, or thought-provoking. Very possibly, some people will walk away from your festival having been convinced, in part because of your good name and the excellence and integrity of your documentary programming, not to vaccinate their children. And very possibly people will die as a result. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There\u2019s no shame in having been taken in by quack \u2013 the reason I made NUTS! is that I wanted to explore just how easy it is to fall for a quack, especially one cloaked in the authority of a documentary film. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I believe you were fooled in just this way: taken in by an apparently legitimate \u201cdocumentary\u201d film, a film which unethically used the tools of my trade toward bad ends. I believe you made a very serious (if human) mistake. But it\u2019s not too late to fix it. You can still apologize for your error and cancel the screening. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I know that some people will say I\u2019m advocating censorship when I say this. I appreciate that concern. The last thing I would want is for festivals to stop being bold, independent tastemakers afraid of controversy. And I would never suggest banning the film is some global sense (as if that were even possible!). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But the problem is not that Vaxxed is controversial, or even that it\u2019s deceptive. Honestly, I consider a large number of well-made, popular documentary films fairly deceptive. The problem is that it is dangerous misinformation being legitimized under the banner of your considerable prestige. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Penny Lane (Our Nixon) is a two-time grantee of the Tribeca Film Institute whose most recent film, NUTS! (concerning an infamous, evil quack who was still considerably funnier and nicer than Andrew Wakefield) recently won a special jury award for editing at Sundance and opens at Film Forum on June 22.

{"prompt": "You are given several news passages. Write a one-page summary of all news. \n\nNews:\nPassage 1:\nHilary Rosen, a Democratic operative with SKD Knickerbocker, touched off a Twitter storm tonight after she went on CNN and said that Ann Romney has \"never worked a day in her life.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The statement was tweeted and retweeted, with a number of people condemning the statement as an attack on the candidate's wife, who was a stay-at-home mom who also raised the couple's five boys, and who has suffered from MS and breast cancer. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ann Romney, who is widely praised as her husband's most effective surrogate, took to Twitter herself for her first-ever post, saying, \"I made a choice to stay home and raise five boys. Believe me, it was hard work.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR (See also: 10 things about Hillary Rosen) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A number of people leapt to her defense, and President Obama's campaign manager Jim Messina and top adviser David Axelrod tweeted out disavowals of a statement that seemed insensitive to stay-at-home moms and sounded like a devaluation of what Ann Romney's life was like. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cI could not disagree with Hilary Rosen any more strongly. Her comments were wrong and family should be off limits. She should apologize,\u201d Messina tweeted. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Also Disappointed in Hilary Rosen's comments about Ann Romney. They were inappropriate and offensive,\" Axelrod tweeted. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Rosen's firm also employs Anita Dunn, former White House communications director, and worked on the Obama campaign in 2008. Her critics on Twitter described her as an \"Obama adviser,\" just a bit of a stretch in description, but not enough of one for some critics, especially after Democrats have hit Republicans for guilt by association with people like Rush Limbaugh for months. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Regardless, Rosen doubled down \u2014 tweeting back at Ann Romney, \"I am raising children too. But most young American women HAVE to BOTH earn a living AND raise children. You know that don't u?\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Earlier, she tweeted in her own defense, \"When I said @AC360 Ann Romney never worked I meant she never had to care for her kids AND earn a paycheck like MOST American women! # Truth\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And she went further in a Huffington Post blog item, saying Mitt Romney has to stop hiding behind his wife's \"skirt,\" and condemned the \"faux outrage\" from the right. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ann Romney, according to Dylan Byers, will be on Fox News tomorrow morning, giving the issue fresh life. And Ann Romney is known for giving strong interviews. Her husband is also guaranteed to be asked about it \u2014 and if the perception is she is being unfairly attacked, he will have won the cycle, and potentially many more to come. For Romney, who polls show facing a large gender gap with women and who has been trying to move away from social issues conversations, it could help him. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The flip side is that Rosen's comments are now getting oxygen beyond the Twitterverse (and the CNN-verse), letting Democrats underscore, without doing much to push it out themselves, the notion that Ann Romney, whose husband was a success in business, may not have had a life similar to some swing voters' lives, despite how hard she worked raising her kids. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Also worth noting \u2014 Messina's line that family should be \"off limits.\" Given the criticisms that Michele Obama has received over the years, it seems likely that Rosen's comment will be highlighted by Democrats if something comes up in the future. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR UPDATE: Rosen appears to have rewritten her Huffington Post blog post last night; the line about Romney hiding behind his wife's skirt is no longer there, and now the column mirrors one that ran on CNN's website.\nPassage 2:\n7 years ago NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR (CNN) - Democratic Strategist Hilary Rosen generated instant bipartisan criticism Wednesday night for her statement that Ann Romney has \"actually never worked a day in her life.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The reaction on Twitter from high level politicos was instant and virtually unanimous: Rosen had gone too far. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR - Follow the Ticker on Twitter: @PoliticalTicker NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Rosen: Ann Romney and working moms NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Rosen's comment also prompted Ann Romney herself to make her twitter debut. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I made a choice to stay home and raise five boys,\" Romney tweeted. \"Believe me, it was hard work.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Rosen, also a CNN political contributor and a working mother, made her comments on CNN's \"AC360.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"What you have is Mitt Romney running around the country, saying, 'Well, you know, my wife tells me that what women really care about are economic issues, and when I listen to my wife, that's what I'm hearing.' Guess what? His wife has actually never worked a day in her life,\" Rosen said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"She's never really dealt with the kinds of economic issues that a majority of the women in this country are facing, in terms of how do we feed our kids, how do we send them to school, and why do we worry about their future,\" Rosen continued, adding that Romney \"just seems so old fashioned when it comes to women.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Her comments drew instant criticism on Twitter from campaign advisers on both sides of the aisle, as well as one of Romney's sons. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Josh Romney posted that his mother \"is one of the smartest, hardest working woman I know.

The accusations were flying. I don't know what it means to be a mom (I have 2 children).

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Spare me the faux anger from the right who view the issue of women's rights and advancement as a way to score political points.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That last one I can actually understand. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Now let's be clear on one thing. I have no judgements about women who work outside the home vs. women who work in the home raising a family. I admire women who can stay home and raise their kids full-time. I even envy them sometimes. It is a wonderful luxury to have the choice. But let's stipulate that it is NOT a choice that most women have in America today. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Why does this even matter? It matters purely because Mitt Romney put the issue of his wife's views squarely on the table. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As Ruth Marcus noted in her column yesterday in the Washington Post, Romney, when asked last week about the gender gap, twice said he wished his wife could take the question. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"My wife has the occasion, as you know, to campaign on her own and also with me,\" Romney told newspaper editors, \"and she reports to me regularly that the issue women care about most is the economy.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR So it begs the question, is Ann Romney Mitt's touchstone for women who are struggling economically or not? Nothing in Ann Romney's history as we have heard it -- hardworking mom she may have been -- leads me to believe that Mitt has chosen the right expert to get feedback on this problem he professes to be so concerned about. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I have nothing against Ann Romney. She seems like a nice lady who has raised nice boys, struggled with illness, and handles its long-term effects with grace and dignity. I admire her grit in talking about her illness publicly. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR What is more important to me and 57% of current women voters is her husband saying he supports women's economic issue because they are the only issues that matter to us and then he fails on even those. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Let's put aside for a moment his views on women's health issues -- such as his pledge to repeal funding for Planned Parenthood or repeal title X -- which provides important health services for poor women, and true anecdotes (such as when he was a Bishop in his church, he actually went to a congregant's hospital room and told a young single mother who had just given birth that she was shaming the church and should give her baby away). Let's put those issues of respect and health dignity away. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Let's just focus on his economic record on behalf of women. When Romney ran Bain Capital, less than 10% of the senior workforce were women. And he said in his 1994 Senate race that it was because he had trouble finding qualified women to be executives. Is there a woman alive who believes that? I personally believe that women hate the way our health issues were made a political football by the Republicans in the last several months. But I am pragmatic enough to believe that the economic issues do matter greatly to women and men alike. But the only way that Mitt Romney will succeed in closing the wide gender gap between him and President Obama is if he stops pretending that it doesn't exist. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Follow Hilary Rosen on Twitter: www.twitter.com/hilaryr\n\n\nNow, write a one-page summary of all the news.\n\nSummary:", "input": "", "context": "Passage 1:\nHilary Rosen, a Democratic operative with SKD Knickerbocker, touched off a Twitter storm tonight after she went on CNN and said that Ann Romney has \"never worked a day in her life.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The statement was tweeted and retweeted, with a number of people condemning the statement as an attack on the candidate's wife, who was a stay-at-home mom who also raised the couple's five boys, and who has suffered from MS and breast cancer. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ann Romney, who is widely praised as her husband's most effective surrogate, took to Twitter herself for her first-ever post, saying, \"I made a choice to stay home and raise five boys. Believe me, it was hard work.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR (See also: 10 things about Hillary Rosen) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A number of people leapt to her defense, and President Obama's campaign manager Jim Messina and top adviser David Axelrod tweeted out disavowals of a statement that seemed insensitive to stay-at-home moms and sounded like a devaluation of what Ann Romney's life was like. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cI could not disagree with Hilary Rosen any more strongly. Her comments were wrong and family should be off limits. She should apologize,\u201d Messina tweeted. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Also Disappointed in Hilary Rosen's comments about Ann Romney. They were inappropriate and offensive,\" Axelrod tweeted. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Rosen's firm also employs Anita Dunn, former White House communications director, and worked on the Obama campaign in 2008. Her critics on Twitter described her as an \"Obama adviser,\" just a bit of a stretch in description, but not enough of one for some critics, especially after Democrats have hit Republicans for guilt by association with people like Rush Limbaugh for months. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Regardless, Rosen doubled down \u2014 tweeting back at Ann Romney, \"I am raising children too. But most young American women HAVE to BOTH earn a living AND raise children. You know that don't u?\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Earlier, she tweeted in her own defense, \"When I said @AC360 Ann Romney never worked I meant she never had to care for her kids AND earn a paycheck like MOST American women! # Truth\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And she went further in a Huffington Post blog item, saying Mitt Romney has to stop hiding behind his wife's \"skirt,\" and condemned the \"faux outrage\" from the right. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ann Romney, according to Dylan Byers, will be on Fox News tomorrow morning, giving the issue fresh life. And Ann Romney is known for giving strong interviews. Her husband is also guaranteed to be asked about it \u2014 and if the perception is she is being unfairly attacked, he will have won the cycle, and potentially many more to come. For Romney, who polls show facing a large gender gap with women and who has been trying to move away from social issues conversations, it could help him. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The flip side is that Rosen's comments are now getting oxygen beyond the Twitterverse (and the CNN-verse), letting Democrats underscore, without doing much to push it out themselves, the notion that Ann Romney, whose husband was a success in business, may not have had a life similar to some swing voters' lives, despite how hard she worked raising her kids. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Also worth noting \u2014 Messina's line that family should be \"off limits.\" Given the criticisms that Michele Obama has received over the years, it seems likely that Rosen's comment will be highlighted by Democrats if something comes up in the future. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR UPDATE: Rosen appears to have rewritten her Huffington Post blog post last night; the line about Romney hiding behind his wife's skirt is no longer there, and now the column mirrors one that ran on CNN's website.\nPassage 2:\n7 years ago NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR (CNN) - Democratic Strategist Hilary Rosen generated instant bipartisan criticism Wednesday night for her statement that Ann Romney has \"actually never worked a day in her life.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The reaction on Twitter from high level politicos was instant and virtually unanimous: Rosen had gone too far. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR - Follow the Ticker on Twitter: @PoliticalTicker NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Rosen: Ann Romney and working moms NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Rosen's comment also prompted Ann Romney herself to make her twitter debut. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I made a choice to stay home and raise five boys,\" Romney tweeted. \"Believe me, it was hard work.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Rosen, also a CNN political contributor and a working mother, made her comments on CNN's \"AC360.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"What you have is Mitt Romney running around the country, saying, 'Well, you know, my wife tells me that what women really care about are economic issues, and when I listen to my wife, that's what I'm hearing.' Guess what? His wife has actually never worked a day in her life,\" Rosen said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"She's never really dealt with the kinds of economic issues that a majority of the women in this country are facing, in terms of how do we feed our kids, how do we send them to school, and why do we worry about their future,\" Rosen continued, adding that Romney \"just seems so old fashioned when it comes to women.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Her comments drew instant criticism on Twitter from campaign advisers on both sides of the aisle, as well as one of Romney's sons. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Josh Romney posted that his mother \"is one of the smartest, hardest working woman I know. Could have done anything with her life, chose to raise me.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The senior adviser to President Barack Obama's reelection bid also took to Twitter to distance the campaign from the comments.

{"prompt": "You are given several news passages. Write a one-page summary of all news. \n\nNews:\nPassage 1:\nGRANTS PASS, Ore. (AP) \u2014 Archaeologists have uncovered a stone tool at an ancient rock shelter in the high desert of eastern Oregon that could turn out to be older than any known site of human occupation in western North America. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The find was announced Thursday by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management, which controls the land on which the site was found. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR University of Oregon archaeologist Patrick O'Grady, who supervises the dig, says the Rimrock Draw Rockshelter outside Riley has not been fully excavated. But the tool, a hand-held scraper chipped from a piece of orange agate not normally found in eastern Oregon, was found about 8 inches below a layer of volcanic ash from an eruption of Mount St. Helens that has been dated to 15,800 years ago. The depth was about 12 feet below the surface. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Bureau of Land Management archaeologist Scott Thomas said that if the age of the site holds up to scrutiny, it would be the oldest west of the Rockies, and another predating the so-called Clovis culture, once generally believed to be the first people to migrate from Asia into North America. The earliest Clovis artifacts, known for distinctive and elegant stone points, are dated to about 13,000 years ago. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR O'Grady called the find \"tantalizing,\" but he added that they want to continue digging this summer to see whether the volcanic ash covers the entire area. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Donald K. Grayson, professor of archaeology at the University of Washington, said the scientific community would be skeptical. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"No one is going to believe this until it is shown there was no break in that ash layer, that the artifact could not have worked its way down from higher up, and until it is published in a convincing way,\" he said. \"Until then, extreme skepticism is all they are going to get.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Two pre-Clovis sites are well documented and generally accepted by scientists, Grayson said. One is Paisley Cave, located about 60 miles southwest of the Rimrock site. The other is Monte Verde in Chile. Both are dated about 1,000 years before the oldest Clovis sites. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If the date of Rimrock holds up, it would put people at the site about 1,500 years earlier, at the end of the Pleistocene era, when mastodons, mammoths, camels, horses and bison roamed the area. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The find has yet to be submitted to a scientific journal for publication, but it has been reported in newsletters and at conferences, Thomas said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Thomas found the site several years ago, while taking a break from carrying supplies to a session of the University of Oregon Archaeological Field School nearby that O'Grady was overseeing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Thomas said he noticed an outcropping of an ancient lava flow, with some very tall sage brush growing in front of it, indicating very deep sediment deposits. The soil was black in front of the rock, indicating someone regularly built cooking fires there for a long time. An ancient streambed ran by, which would have given people more reason to stay there. And on the surface, he found a stone point of the stemmed type, found at sites both older and younger than Clovis. Similar points have been found at Paisley Cave NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Volunteers looking around the surface found some 30 stemmed points, and the field school started excavations in 2011, O'Grady said. Uncovered above and below the volcanic ash layer were fragments of teeth believed to be from ancient camels. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Tests by Archaeological Investigations Northwest Inc. of Portland on blood residue on the agate scraper were consistent with the bovid family of animals, Thomas said. The most likely bovine animal living in Oregon at that time would have been an ancestor of the buffalo.\nPassage 2:\nPORTLAND, Ore. - NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Near the Rimrock Draw Rockshelter outside of Riley in southeast Oregon, archaeologists recently discovered evidence suggesting one of the oldest known human occupations in the western United States, officials said Thursday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Archaeologists with the Bureau of Land Management and the University of Oregon Archaeological Field School have been excavating at the Rimrock Draw Rockshelter since 2011.

(AP) \u2014 Archaeologists have uncovered a stone tool at an ancient rock shelter in the high desert of eastern Oregon that could turn out to be older than any known site of human occupation in western North America. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The find was announced Thursday by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management, which controls the land on which the site was found. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR University of Oregon archaeologist Patrick O'Grady, who supervises the dig, says the Rimrock Draw Rockshelter outside Riley has not been fully excavated. But the tool, a hand-held scraper chipped from a piece of orange agate not normally found in eastern Oregon, was found about 8 inches below a layer of volcanic ash from an eruption of Mount St. Helens that has been dated to 15,800 years ago. The depth was about 12 feet below the surface. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Bureau of Land Management archaeologist Scott Thomas said that if the age of the site holds up to scrutiny, it would be the oldest west of the Rockies, and another predating the so-called Clovis culture, once generally believed to be the first people to migrate from Asia into North America. The earliest Clovis artifacts, known for distinctive and elegant stone points, are dated to about 13,000 years ago. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR O'Grady called the find \"tantalizing,\" but he added that they want to continue digging this summer to see whether the volcanic ash covers the entire area. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Donald K. Grayson, professor of archaeology at the University of Washington, said the scientific community would be skeptical. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"No one is going to believe this until it is shown there was no break in that ash layer, that the artifact could not have worked its way down from higher up, and until it is published in a convincing way,\" he said. \"Until then, extreme skepticism is all they are going to get.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Two pre-Clovis sites are well documented and generally accepted by scientists, Grayson said. One is Paisley Cave, located about 60 miles southwest of the Rimrock site. The other is Monte Verde in Chile. Both are dated about 1,000 years before the oldest Clovis sites. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If the date of Rimrock holds up, it would put people at the site about 1,500 years earlier, at the end of the Pleistocene era, when mastodons, mammoths, camels, horses and bison roamed the area. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The find has yet to be submitted to a scientific journal for publication, but it has been reported in newsletters and at conferences, Thomas said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Thomas found the site several years ago, while taking a break from carrying supplies to a session of the University of Oregon Archaeological Field School nearby that O'Grady was overseeing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Thomas said he noticed an outcropping of an ancient lava flow, with some very tall sage brush growing in front of it, indicating very deep sediment deposits. The soil was black in front of the rock, indicating someone regularly built cooking fires there for a long time. An ancient streambed ran by, which would have given people more reason to stay there. And on the surface, he found a stone point of the stemmed type, found at sites both older and younger than Clovis. Similar points have been found at Paisley Cave NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Volunteers looking around the surface found some 30 stemmed points, and the field school started excavations in 2011, O'Grady said. Uncovered above and below the volcanic ash layer were fragments of teeth believed to be from ancient camels. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Tests by Archaeological Investigations Northwest Inc. of Portland on blood residue on the agate scraper were consistent with the bovid family of animals, Thomas said. The most likely bovine animal living in Oregon at that time would have been an ancestor of the buffalo.\nPassage 2:\nPORTLAND, Ore. - NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Near the Rimrock Draw Rockshelter outside of Riley in southeast Oregon, archaeologists recently discovered evidence suggesting one of the oldest known human occupations in the western United States, officials said Thursday.

After nearly seven years in various jails, authorities relocated Wang to a remote village, the Hindustan Times reports. He was not allowed to return to China, however, but nor was he given Indian citizenship. He lived in a kind of limbo. \"I cried in the night,\" Wang says of those first years in India. \"I missed my mother.\" He eventually married, worked at a flour mill, and had children and grandchildren, but he never stopped hoping to return home.

Many riders had trouble staying upright and gathering momentum between tricks. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cThat\u2019s not what halfpipe is supposed to be like,\u201d Teter said. \u201cPeople are supposed to be landing their tricks.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Snowboarders said the pipe was actually improved from Sunday, the first day of practice. The walls and curves received significant work. One U.S. coach said the warm weather Monday helped the snow stick earlier in the day, but riders said after a single practice run the pipe worsened and snowboarders began to fear what conditions would be like during actual competition. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR American Danny Davis stopped short of calling the course dangerous. \u201cIt's just not as fun,\u201d he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR With more freestyle events, the Sochi Olympics will look more like the Winter X Games than ever before. (Associated Press) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Riders say they\u2019ve been told the course will receive further treatment and grooming overnight, but some were openly considering their options after Monday's practice. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cIf all of us got together, and we\u2019re like, \u2018We\u2019re not doing it, let\u2019s push it back,\u2019 maybe they would,\u201d Teter said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if that\u2019s going to happen.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Teter acknowledged such a protest was unlikely, but she said White\u2019s representatives have expressed concerns. White pulled out of the slopestyle competition last week, calling the course \u201cintimidating\u201d and saying he didn\u2019t want to risk injury before his featured event. While he expressed frustration with the halfpipe course Monday night, he wasn\u2019t certain what changes might occur before the competition begins. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cI don\u2019t know the exact plan,\u201d White said. \u201cI\u2019m sure there will be some sort of coaches\u2019 meeting or something. I don\u2019t really get involved in that. I\u2019m hoping they can do whatever they can to make it a better pipe. It\u2019s hard to get here and see this and feel the pressure. I don\u2019t know.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Under the current conditions, most said they\u2019d have to alter their planned runs. White said he\u2019d have trouble throwing his cab double cork 1440. \u201cI\u2019m hoping for the best,\u201d he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Said Davis: \u201cThere\u2019s a bunch of kids who can ride well in these conditions. I\u2019m a little bit worried about myself riding so well in these conditions.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cIn the U.S., we build the best pipes in the world,\u201d said Peter Foley, the U.S. snowboarding head coach. \u201cWe\u2019ve had great contest pipes all year long. . . .

Despite the conditions this week, she said the Sochi pipe is actually an improvement over the one in Vancouver four years ago because of its steeper walls and a longer run. Even if conditions aren\u2019t perfect this week, she said the best riders in the world should be good enough to deal with the adversity. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cIf you\u2019re making a mistake, it\u2019s going to be amplified,\u201d said Clark, who won gold at the 2002 Games. \u201cThe strongest rider is still going to come out on top.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Even though tricks will be thrown and medals handed out, the event deserves better, Teter said, particularly on an Olympic stage with the whole world watching. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cYou want everybody to see snowboarding as it should be, looking phenomenal with everybody doing what they know how to do,\u201d she said. \u201cHopefully, they can pull it together.\u201d\n\n\nNow, write a one-page summary of all the news.\n\nSummary:", "input": "", "context": "Passage 1:\nKRASNAYA POLYANA, Russia \u2014 Shaun White stood at the top of the halfpipe, the last contestant of the competition, needing a near-perfect run to capture his third consecutive gold medal at the Winter Olympics.

Unfortunately, this crucial forage fish appears to be in the midst of a severe population decline. Its absence will be felt by dozens of species of West Coast seabirds, whales, sharks, dolphins, and commercially important fish such as salmon and tuna that depend on sardines as a major food source. In addition, because sardines have been a staple of commercial purse-seine fishing on the West Coast, their decline raises the potential for fishing pressure to shift to similar, but more abundant, schooling species of forage fish. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Pacific Fishery Management Council, which manages fishing in federal waters off California, Oregon, and Washington, should do two things to help maintain a healthy Pacific Ocean: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Set conservative catch limits on sardines when the population is so low.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cause for concern NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Populations of forage fish along the West Coast fluctuate widely, so a species can be abundant one year and dwindle unexpectedly the next. That\u2019s because forage fish are highly dependent on the upwelling of cold nutrient- rich waters to stimulate the growth of phytoplankton, their primary food source. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Pacific sardine fishery, immortalized in John Steinbeck\u2019s novel Cannery Row, collapsed notoriously the 1950s. The November 2013 population estimate of 378,000 tons is the lowest in more than a decade, far below the peak of 1.5 million tons estimated in 2000 and a major decline by historical standards. Geological records of fish scales deposited off Southern California indicate that the unfished sardine population fluctuated naturally between a low of 400,000 tons to as much as 16 million tons. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Keeping an eye on the big picture NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Forage fish account for more than one-third of the global catch of marine fish and are mostly used for industrial purposes such as feed for livestock, poultry, and farmed fish rather than being directly eaten by people. Most forage fish landed on the West Coast are exported for purposes such as bait in tuna longlining in Asia or as feed for farmed fish. In 2012, the Lenfest Forage Fish Task Force, a group of eminent scientists from around the world, calculated that forage fish worldwide are worth twice as much when left in the water\u2014about $11.3 billion\u2014as they are when caught because of their value as food for commercially important predators.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Tonight's pretty reflective of how things have been going,\" Hanson said. \"Not very well.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR To blame is the biggest sardine crash in generations, which has made schools of the small, silvery fish a rarity on the West Coast. The decline has prompted steep cuts in the amount fishermen are allowed to catch, and scientists say the effects are probably radiating throughout the ecosystem, starving brown pelicans, sea lions and other predators that rely on the oily, energy-rich fish for food. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If sardines don't recover soon, experts warn, the West Coast's marine mammals, seabirds and fishermen could suffer for years. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The reason for the drop is unclear. Sardine populations are famously volatile, but the decline is the steepest since the collapse of the sardine fishery in the mid-20th century. And their numbers are projected to keep sliding. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR One factor is a naturally occurring climate cycle known as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, which in recent years has brought cold, nutrient-rich water to the West Coast. While those conditions have brought a boom in some species, such as market squid, they have repelled sardines. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If nature is responsible for the decline, history shows the fish will bounce back when ocean conditions improve. But without a full understanding of the causes, the crash is raising alarm. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR An assessment last fall found the population had dropped 72% since its last peak in 2006. Spawning has taken a dive too. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In November, federal fishery managers slashed harvest limits by more than two-thirds, but some environmental groups have argued the catch should be halted outright. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We shouldn't be harvesting sardines any time the population is this low,\" said Geoff Shester, California program director for the conservation group Oceana, which contends that continuing to fish for them could speed their decline and arrest any recovery. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Pacific sardine is the ocean's quintessential boom-bust fish. It is short-lived and prolific, and its numbers are wildly unpredictable, surging up and down in decades-long cycles in response to natural shifts in the ocean environment. When conditions are poor, sardine populations plunge. When seas are favorable, they flourish in massive schools. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It was one of those seemingly inexhaustible swells that propelled California's sardine fishery to a zenith in the 1940s. Aggressive pursuit of the species transformed Monterey into one of the world's top fishing ports. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And then it collapsed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR By mid-century sardines had practically vanished, and in the 1960s California established a moratorium on sardine fishing that lasted 18 years. The population rebounded in the 1980s and fishing resumed, but never at the level of its heyday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Since the 1940s scientists have debated how much of the collapse was caused by ocean conditions and how much by overfishing. Now, researchers are posing the same question. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It's a terribly difficult scientific problem,\" said Russ Vetter, director of the Fisheries Resources Division at NOAA's Southwest Fisheries Science Center. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Separate sardine populations off Japan, Peru and Chile fluctuate in the same 50- to 70-year climate cycle but have been more heavily exploited, Vetter said. West Coast sardines are considered one of the most cautiously fished stocks in the world, a practice that could explain why their latest rebound lasted as long as it did. The West Coast's last sardine decline began in 1999, but the population shot back up by the mid-2000s. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In recent years scientists have gained a deeper understanding of sardines' value as \"forage fish,\" small but nutrition-packed species such as herring and market squid that form the core of the ocean food web, funneling energy upward by eating tiny plankton and being preyed on by big fish, seabirds, seals and whales. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Now, they say, there is evidence some ocean predators are starving without sardines. Scarcity of prey is the leading theory behind the 1,600 malnourished sea lion pups that washed up along beaches from Santa Barbara to San Diego in early 2013, said Sharon Melin, a wildlife biologist at the National Marine Fisheries Service. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Melin's research indicates that nursing sea lion mothers could not find fatty sardines, so they fed on less nutritious market squid, rockfish and hake and produced less milk for their young in 2012. The following year their pups showed up on the coast in overwhelming numbers, stranded and emaciated.\n\n\nNow, write a one-page summary of all the news.\n\nSummary:", "input": "", "context": "Passage 1:\nResources Thank the PFMC for Protecting the West Coast Ecosystem NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Pacific coast of North America supports one of the most vibrant and diverse marine ecosystems on Earth, largely because of the presence of thick schools of small prey fish such as Pacific sardines.

When conditions are poor, sardine populations plunge. When seas are favorable, they flourish in massive schools. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It was one of those seemingly inexhaustible swells that propelled California's sardine fishery to a zenith in the 1940s. Aggressive pursuit of the species transformed Monterey into one of the world's top fishing ports. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And then it collapsed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR By mid-century sardines had practically vanished, and in the 1960s California established a moratorium on sardine fishing that lasted 18 years. The population rebounded in the 1980s and fishing resumed, but never at the level of its heyday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Since the 1940s scientists have debated how much of the collapse was caused by ocean conditions and how much by overfishing. Now, researchers are posing the same question. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It's a terribly difficult scientific problem,\" said Russ Vetter, director of the Fisheries Resources Division at NOAA's Southwest Fisheries Science Center. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Separate sardine populations off Japan, Peru and Chile fluctuate in the same 50- to 70-year climate cycle but have been more heavily exploited, Vetter said. West Coast sardines are considered one of the most cautiously fished stocks in the world, a practice that could explain why their latest rebound lasted as long as it did. The West Coast's last sardine decline began in 1999, but the population shot back up by the mid-2000s. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In recent years scientists have gained a deeper understanding of sardines' value as \"forage fish,\" small but nutrition-packed species such as herring and market squid that form the core of the ocean food web, funneling energy upward by eating tiny plankton and being preyed on by big fish, seabirds, seals and whales. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Now, they say, there is evidence some ocean predators are starving without sardines. Scarcity of prey is the leading theory behind the 1,600 malnourished sea lion pups that washed up along beaches from Santa Barbara to San Diego in early 2013, said Sharon Melin, a wildlife biologist at the National Marine Fisheries Service. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Melin's research indicates that nursing sea lion mothers could not find fatty sardines, so they fed on less nutritious market squid, rockfish and hake and produced less milk for their young in 2012. The following year their pups showed up on the coast in overwhelming numbers, stranded and emaciated.\n", "answers": ["The West Coast sardine population was down 72% since 2006 per a fall assessment\u2014the worst crash since the mid-20th century, and one with far-reaching implications, particularly since the steep decline is expected to continue. One of those implications: Ocean predators that depend on sardines may be starving, the Los Angeles Times reports: Researchers think 1,600 malnourished sea lion pups that washed up onshore in Southern California last year were born to nursing mothers whose milk quality was compromised after they had to turn from fatty sardines to other fish; brown pelicans\u2014which also depend on sardines for food\u2014are also suffering. Neither species can turn to anchovies as an alternative food source, as they normally would, because their numbers are also down. Fishermen, too, are affected; they're not allowed to catch as many sardines (harvest maximums have been dramatically cut)\u2014and they often can't find any to catch (the LA Times follows one boat that caught zero fish in a 12-hour outing). So what's going on? Sardine populations often experience wild swings, booming when conditions are good and then dropping sharply when conditions shift. After the last bad collapse, which happened after a massive boom in the 1940s, sardine fishing was halted for 18 years beginning in the 1960s, and though the population bounced back in the 1980s, it was never the same. Scientists now, as then, aren't sure how to divide the blame between ocean conditions (the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, a climate cycle, has brought cold, sardine-unfriendly water to the area) and overfishing. Last month, Pew Charitable Trusts warned that dozens of species, including whales, sharks, dolphins, salmon, and tuna, could feel an impact."], "length": 1551, "dataset": "multi_news_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "f7a80199602fd125d0170e159ef8cf03b2850f0261096690", "pred": " The Pacific coast of North America is home to a diverse marine ecosystem, which is largely dependent on schools of small prey fish such as Pacific sardines.

The decline has been attributed to a naturally occurring climate cycle known as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, which has brought cold nutrient-rich water to the West Coast, repelling sardines.

{"prompt": "You are given several news passages. Write a one-page summary of all news. \n\nNews:\nPassage 1:\nDuring Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon, all of us living in besieged West Beirut were aware that the Israeli military was seeking to eliminate the leadership of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), and had no qualms about killing large numbers of civilians in the process. We knew this from the aerial bombardment of the area around Beirut's Arab University, where the PLO had many of its offices. Dozens of apartment buildings there had been reduced to rubble. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Toward the end of Israel's ten-week bombardment and siege of Beirut, a building that housed refugees located several blocks from my home in the Sanayeh neighborhood was entirely destroyed from the air, killing dozens. Immediately after the attack, I surveyed the carnage with a friend. After leaving him to return home, I heard another huge explosion -- it was a car bomb, presumably set off close to the destroyed building in order to kill those trying to rescue survivors. My friend barely escaped with his life. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This and other examples of the handiwork of the architects of the Israeli invasion of Lebanon, preeminent among whom was Ariel Sharon, failed to make it into most of the hagiographic coverage of the man's passing in the American and Israeli media. We were instead told that Sharon was \"controversial,\" and that Palestinians had criticisms of him, but that he was a \"hero,\" a \"staunch defender of Israel's security,\" and most grotesquely, \"a peacemaker.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In September 2012, the New York Times published an op-ed on the 30th anniversary of the Sabra and Shatila massacres, during which the Israeli military stood by while their right-wing Lebanese allies murdered nearly 1,400 defenseless Palestinian and Lebanese civilians in a Beirut refugee camp. The article, which was based on newly uncovered documents in the Israel State Archives, revealed new details on Sharon's role in, and indirect American diplomatic responsibility for, these atrocities. The New York Times did not, however, feature this account in its coverage of Sharon's death. Instead, it re-ran online a 1983 apologia by Sharon for his invasion of Lebanon, during which there were nearly 50,000 casualties, most of them civilians. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Lebanon war that Sharon, then the defense minister, did more than anyone else to launch was an unmitigated catastrophe for the Palestinians, the Lebanese, and in the view of most Israelis at the time, Israel itself. Israel's subsequent occupation of South Lebanon until 2000, the consequent intensification of the Lebanese civil war, the slaughter of untold numbers of innocents, and the deaths of hundreds of Israeli soldiers and thousands of other combatants should all be laid in large part at Sharon's feet. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sharon's profound impact on the Middle East stretched far beyond Lebanon. If the creation of a truly sovereign, independent, contiguous, and viable Palestinian state is not possible today -- as most sober observers believe -- this is largely his achievement. From his appointment as agriculture minister in 1977 until his passing from the Israeli political scene after his stroke in 2006, he probably did more than any other Israeli leader to make Israel's colonization of the occupied West Bank and Arab East Jerusalem an astonishing success. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sharon flew over the region in a helicopter to select sites for new colonies, all the while pioneering novel means of stealing land from its Palestinian owners. As prime minister, he continued this expansion process, which has turned the occupied West Bank into a Swiss cheese patchwork thoroughly dominated by lush Israeli settlements on what seems to be every hilltop. Simultaneously, he engineered a unilateral withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, while retaining draconian control over it from without, thereby turning it into the world's largest open-air prison. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Vice President Joe Biden eulogized Sharon today as a \"historic leader\" who was dedicated to the pursuit of peace. The very idea is ludicrous. Sharon began his career as a military commander renowned for ruthless assaults on innocent civilians -- like the slaughter in the West Bank village of Qibya in 1953, when commandos of his Unit 101 blew up homes over the heads of their residents, killing 69 people. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The attack led to the first ever U.N. Security Council condemnation of Israel. It was not an isolated incident: Indeed, it established a pattern of dozens of \"eyes for an eye,\" and of the Israeli leadership's systematic deception about what was actually happening on the ground. This approach has characterized Israel's response to any resistance to its expansion since the foundation of the state. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sharon was emblematic of the Israeli refusal to accept that Palestinian resistance was an inevitable response to the forcible establishment of a Jewish state and the concomitant expulsion of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians. In later years, he became one of the most sophisticated employers of the trope of \"terrorism\" to demean this resistance. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The characterization not only of those who took up arms against Israel, but of all Palestinians, as \"terrorists\" can be seen in the transcript of a meeting between Sharon, other Israeli ministers, and U.S. envoy Morris Draper on Sept. 17, 1982, in the midst of the Sabra and Shatila massacres. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Morris Draper: The hostile people will say, sure the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] is going to stay in West Beirut and they will let the Lebanese go and kill the Palestinians in the camps. Ariel Sharon: So we'll kill them. They will not be left there. You are not going to save them. You are not going to save these groups of the international terrorism [sic]. MD: We are not interested in saving any of these people. AS: If you don't want the Lebanese to kill them, we will kill them. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Everyone present at this meeting, American and Israelis, knew that there were no PLO fighters in the camps. More than 15,000 PLO personnel had been evacuated from Beirut weeks earlier in a deal brokered by the United States. Had any number of these hardened combatants -- who had resisted the Israeli siege of Beirut for nearly two months -- been present, the perpetrators of these massacres would not have been able to operate with total impunity. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Nonetheless, during this 90-minute meeting with Draper, Sharon repeated the canard that thousands of \"terrorists\" had remained behind after the PLO evacuation. He used the term \"terrorist\" 39 times, as part of a ceaseless browbeating of Draper, who had been told to demand that the Israelis immediately withdraw their forces from West Beirut. Instead of complying with Draper's request, Sharon stonewalled, giving the butchers inside the camps many more hours to complete their gruesome work under the glow of star shells fired by Israeli troops to illuminate the killing ground. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Today, the American and Israeli media are celebrating this very same man. It is hard to imagine this kind of kid-glove treatment of anyone else with such a list of atrocities to his name. But apparently, such inconvenient facts are not welcome. In a more just world, he would have ended up facing the International Criminal Court in The Hague. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Yoav Lemmer-Pool/Getty Images\nPassage 2:\nCorrection: An earlier version of this op-ed incorrectly stated that Ariel Sharon \u201cwithdrew troops from southern Lebanon.\u201d Then-Prime Minister Ehud Barak withdrew Israeli troops from southern Lebanon in 2000. The following version has been updated. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Henry A. Kissinger was secretary of state from 1973 to 1977. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Arik Sharon started as a warrior. He ended his career on the way to being a peacemaker. On that journey from fighting in every one of Israel\u2019s wars to lying comatose for eight years in a Jerusalem hospital, he symbolized the anguish and dilemmas of Israel. A people who had come to their historic homeland had established themselves, surrounded by a culture that never acquiesced in ceding what it considered Islamic patrimony. Even before the proclamation of the Jewish state, Israel found itself in a state of war that has never ended. It has always lacked the essential prerequisite for peaceful coexistence with its neighbors: their recognition of its existence, which everywhere else is the precondition of diplomacy, not its outcome. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This state of affairs produced two aspects of the Israeli psyche: a hair-trigger response to security threats and an attitude toward the peace process both grudging and nostalgic. Israel\u2019s margin of survival has been so narrow that its leaders felt they could not run risks about emerging military capabilities of countries that refused to accept and daily castigated the Jewish state. When threatened, preemption became its style of warfare. And it viewed the peace process both with reluctance to give up territory in an environment so rife with denunciation and with a definition of peace so sweeping as to be very difficult to achieve in a single negotiation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When he was struck down by a stroke in 2006 , Sharon as prime minister was in the process of putting before his people a vision of coexistence with the Palestinians. Many visionaries of peace in Israel were military men: Yitzhak Rabin won the 1967 war. Shimon Peres, though not a military man, went the same route: a hawk in his early career, a passionate advocate of the peace process in recent decades. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sharon had to undertake the longest journey to reach this insight. A daring commander, he conducted the battle that reversed the tide of the 1973 war; he was the principal advocate of the operations in Lebanon. For many years, he deplored America\u2019s decision in 1973 to bring about a negotiated end of the war. I was secretary of state at the time, and he missed few opportunities to chide me.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The United States acted as it did then because we were convinced that, however vast the margin of victory, it would leave Israel with its historic challenge: how to translate victories over threats to its security into political coexistence with the societies it lived among. The Egyptian leader, Anwar Sadat, seemed to offer such a prospect. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In our many discussions, I always respected, then grew to admire and eventually develop affection for, this dedicated man living on a farm at the edge of the Negev desert, a kind of symbolic outpost. I looked forward to his visits while he was out of office; he would arrive at our meetings with maps under his arm that he used to explain the minimum requirements of Israel\u2019s survival. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As prime minister, Sharon unexpectedly broadened his definition of security. He sought to bridge the gap between physical and political security with the same courage and decisiveness that had brought him victory in battle. He volunteered the largest withdrawal in Israel\u2019s history. He ended the Israeli occupation of Gaza and returned it to Arab self-rule as a unilateral act without reciprocity, abandoning even the Jewish settlements that had been established there. These gestures were conceived as a test case for a negotiation about the future of the West Bank, which Sharon once had viewed as a permanent Israeli outpost. The man who had identified security with the acquisition of territory became willing to cede territory for an outcome to fulfill the hopes for peace. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It cannot be said that the result justified this act of faith. Israel was threatened by missile attacks from non-state actors: Hezbollah in Lebanon, Hamas in Gaza. Politically, Sharon\u2019s vision was under attack from all sides: from those in Israel who insisted on a larger state, from Arab leaders who denied Israel the right to exist altogether, and from non-state terrorist groups. Still, Sharon\u2019s vision reflected an essential first step; it was a sacrifice on behalf of raising prospects for a lasting peace \u2014 to which both sides must make a contribution by taking concrete steps and not by largely symbolic acts alone. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR With another peace process underway, one needs to respect the courage of those who are willing to brave it in light of so many disappointments. It must be conducted both with commitment to the process and with a recollection of unfulfilled hopes. The vision of peace must be coupled with a determination not to permit the peace process to be turned into another form of warfare. An outcome must not only draw lines of territorial divisions but also bring a meaningful acceptance of the Jewish state by its negotiating partner as well as by key Arab states.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When he was struck down by a stroke in 2006 , Sharon as prime minister was in the process of putting before his people a vision of coexistence with the Palestinians. Many visionaries of peace in Israel were military men: Yitzhak Rabin won the 1967 war. Shimon Peres, though not a military man, went the same route: a hawk in his early career, a passionate advocate of the peace process in recent decades. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sharon had to undertake the longest journey to reach this insight. A daring commander, he conducted the battle that reversed the tide of the 1973 war; he was the principal advocate of the operations in Lebanon. For many years, he deplored America\u2019s decision in 1973 to bring about a negotiated end of the war. I was secretary of state at the time, and he missed few opportunities to chide me.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The United States acted as it did then because we were convinced that, however vast the margin of victory, it would leave Israel with its historic challenge: how to translate victories over threats to its security into political coexistence with the societies it lived among. The Egyptian leader, Anwar Sadat, seemed to offer such a prospect. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In our many discussions, I always respected, then grew to admire and eventually develop affection for, this dedicated man living on a farm at the edge of the Negev desert, a kind of symbolic outpost. I looked forward to his visits while he was out of office; he would arrive at our meetings with maps under his arm that he used to explain the minimum requirements of Israel\u2019s survival. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As prime minister, Sharon unexpectedly broadened his definition of security. He sought to bridge the gap between physical and political security with the same courage and decisiveness that had brought him victory in battle. He volunteered the largest withdrawal in Israel\u2019s history. He ended the Israeli occupation of Gaza and returned it to Arab self-rule as a unilateral act without reciprocity, abandoning even the Jewish settlements that had been established there. These gestures were conceived as a test case for a negotiation about the future of the West Bank, which Sharon once had viewed as a permanent Israeli outpost. The man who had identified security with the acquisition of territory became willing to cede territory for an outcome to fulfill the hopes for peace. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It cannot be said that the result justified this act of faith. Israel was threatened by missile attacks from non-state actors: Hezbollah in Lebanon, Hamas in Gaza. Politically, Sharon\u2019s vision was under attack from all sides: from those in Israel who insisted on a larger state, from Arab leaders who denied Israel the right to exist altogether, and from non-state terrorist groups. Still, Sharon\u2019s vision reflected an essential first step; it was a sacrifice on behalf of raising prospects for a lasting peace \u2014 to which both sides must make a contribution by taking concrete steps and not by largely symbolic acts alone. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR With another peace process underway, one needs to respect the courage of those who are willing to brave it in light of so many disappointments. It must be conducted both with commitment to the process and with a recollection of unfulfilled hopes. The vision of peace must be coupled with a determination not to permit the peace process to be turned into another form of warfare. An outcome must not only draw lines of territorial divisions but also bring a meaningful acceptance of the Jewish state by its negotiating partner as well as by key Arab states.

The findings of the study offer some potentially disappointing but illuminating conclusions that could inform advocacy and outreach strategies. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Abstract: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the US, the population of current vegetarians/vegans sits at approximately 2%, while approximately 10% of the population are former vegetarians/vegans and about 88% have never been veg. This study, published by HRC, looks closely at that 12% of the population that identifies as either current or former vegetarians/vegans, and tries to better understand what makes people lapse, and in turn, what factors might help keep people veg. The findings presented here offer a lot of possible avenues for new strategic thinking in veg advocacy, and how we might move the vegetarian/vegan diet from the margins more towards the center. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Though there is rarely just one reason for people adopting or giving up a veg diet, it is not completely clear if lapses are due more to social pressures (eating a diet that seems unusual or outside the norm), or based on some other difficulty inherent to the diet itself. That being said, the findings do illuminate some things that many lapsed vegetarians/vegans have in common, such as transitioning to the diet too quickly, not being involved socially with other veg folks, and not being able to address certain food cravings. The study also shows that current vegetarians/vegans have a wide range of motivations that keep them veg, which may mean that more diverse messaging and outreach could have a positive impact. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This phase of release is part of a larger study of U.S. vegetarians and vegans. You can read more about the key findings, as well as the see the tables and methodologies, in the attached PDFs.\nPassage 2:\nIn 1995 I decided to stop eating meat. I could never really quite explain why, I think it was something to do with watching a documentary where they cooked a cat and partly because I had a really crap job working for Wolves Poly and felt my life was slipping away. It definitely wasn't anything to do with any 'vegetarian month'. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I did a number of weird things. I experimented with stopping washing my hair (it got greasy), I stopped watching TV after catching Newsnight really stoned and deciding that Jeremy Paxman was fundamentally a comedian so there was little difference between the news and Beadle's About. I also stopped eating meat. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR First it was just red meat. I said goodbye in a Birmingham Burger King; the sandwich was greasy and unpleasant and I thought 'good riddance'. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I found eating only white meat was hard. People didn't know what to cook for me - they'd tell me I was just being awkward. They were right, so there was only one thing for it, cutting out all meat altogether. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR So I simply stopped putting it in my mouth. It was that simple. I didn't feel any different and what I cooked didn't really change as I was a complete povvo and didn't bother buying much meat anyway. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR To be honest, I was the world's worst vegetarian. You see - I didn't really like vegetables very much. I'd spent most of my childhood terrified of them - horrid bland mushy things. It's only as an adult I realise that part of the problem is my mother's cooking - she hates using salt and has a tendency to over boil things. Thanks, Mum. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR So there we are. A vegetarian who hates vegetables and mostly lives on pasta and cheese. Healthy. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Fast-forward nearly 15 years and I'm a father of two and increasingly aware of my diet. My wife stopped her vegetarian ways when pregnancy brought cravings for meat. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR With her help (this makes her sound like my sponsor in Fussy Eaters Anonymous) I'd managed to eat more vegetables - by the time our second child was in the womb she was having spinach cravings and I didn't complain once about having to eat boiled green leaves every day. For six months. So I was doing better with a wider diet but still no drinking from the meaty cup. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR My four-year-old son has the restricted palate that children often have. He mostly refuses to eat anything that isn't sausages or fruit, so dining out was becoming difficult. There was the small circle of cheesy carbs I'd eat, and the intersection with the circle of sausages that my son wants to eat was - well, if you understand your Venn diagrams you'll know there wasn't much in the middle. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It was a trip to Hastings that finally did it. At a fish 'n' chip shop pretty much the only thing on the menu I could eat was a microwaved cheese pasty. I simply couldn't face it and ordered fish. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Can't say I particularly enjoyed it. I found the portion of thick white flesh alarmingly large and I didn't want to think about the skin at all. However it did leave me feeling satisfied in a way that I haven't felt in a long time. Every cell in my body screaming \"protein - that's what you need.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR My wife was very impressed with me. She asked me what I wanted to try next and the thing that had been filling my thoughts since deciding to allow meat back into my life was pepperoni pizza. Those little toasted cups of fat that make for a party in the mouth everyone can afford. Although to ponce it up a bit we ate it in Hampstead. Lardy dah. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Bacon. Let's talk about bacon. There's no meat more glorious than bacon. You can add it to pasta instead of cheese. You can stick it in a sandwich, er ... instead of cheese. Or even rub it on to attract men (a top tip there ladies). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On telling my friends I was eating meat, one looked proud and said, \"Welcome back to Man Club.\" Although my new macho credentials were severely dented by the admission that largely I'd been eating chicken - \"Chicken? Why, us men class chicken as a vegetable.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I still haven't tried real meat. I can do a spag bog or even a burger but no steaks. I'm still a bit frightened of them. All too fleshy. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Many people must have had a similar experience. If you're a lapsed vegetarian (or a resurgent meat eater), what was it that made you fall off the vegetarian wagon?\nPassage 3:\nAfter decades of a growing appetite for meat, U.S. consumption is finally dropping after hitting \"peak meat\" a decade ago. But while many people are eating less meat, giving it up totally is much harder. Few people stick with their decision to become vegetarian or vegan. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In an attempt to move animal-free diets \"from the margins more towards the center,\" the Humane Research Council just put out the first study to put numbers to the lapsed vegetarian phenomenon. Their main takeaway is essentially what people have said for years: getting people to reduce their meat and dairy intake will be more effective overall than demanding \"purity,\" or complete elimination of animal products from their diet. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR According to their research, drawn from a representative sample of more than 11,000 adults over age 17 in the U.S., while only 2% of the U.S. population is currently vegetarian or vegan, another 10% used to be. Put another way, they found that only 1 in 5 vegetarians and vegans maintains their diet; a full 84% eventually revert back to eating meat or other animal products. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The study also shows how and why many people lapse. Most former vegetarians and vegans (65%) said they first transitioned to their veg diet in just a few days or weeks, while fewer current vegetarians (53%) transitioned that quickly, suggesting that perhaps a slower approach leads to longer-lasting results. They also found that the \"window of opportunity is limited,\" when it comes to getting people to stick to their diets: A third-of people abandoned their animal-free diets in three months or less, and more than half abandoned it within the first year. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Reasons for quitting varied, but perhaps intuitively, a lot comes down to relationships. A third of all former vegetarians lived with a non-vegetarians or non-vegan partner when they went back to eating meat. The study also found that current vegetarians were more likely to cite multiple reasons for being vegetarian\u2014such as animal welfare, environmentalism, and personal health\u2014while many former vegetarians (58%) cited health as the main motivator. In other words, from the advocacy group\u2019s perspective, health can be an effective \"foot in the door\" approach to increasing the number of vegetarians and vegans, but often not enough to keep people animal-free for the long-term. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Humane Research Council also says advocates need to change the culture around being vegetarian or vegan and acknowledge its challenges. More than 60% of former vegetarians/vegans disliked sticking out from the crowd because of their diet, and 58% did not see their diet as part of their identity. Nearly 50% said they found it too difficult to maintain a \"pure diet.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The latest findings once again show that a message focused on reduction instead of elimination of animal products may be more effective to create an overall decline in animal product consumption,\" the report says. \"Advocates would be well advised to soften their appeals to avoid suggesting the choice is all or nothing.\"\n\n\nNow, write a one-page summary of all the news.\n\nSummary:", "input": "", "context": "Passage 1:\n[Full Text]This HRC study examines key factors in people\u2019s decisions to either adopt or give up a vegetarian or vegan diet, and the first set of findings being released compares individuals who currently eat a vegetarian or vegan diet with those who have been vegetarian or vegan in the past but now consume meat.

Write a one-page summary of all news. \n\nNews:\nPassage 1:\nYouTube\u2019s top trending content at the moment isn\u2019t an advertisement, music video, or movie trailer. It is not a viral challenge video, nor is it something about Fortnite. Instead, it\u2019s a shockingly raw breakup video featuring two of YouTube\u2019s biggest comedy vloggers, Liza Koshy and David Dobrik. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Liza Koshy, 22, is best known for going to stores and causing improvisational mischief, often featuring random items that anyone can buy. David Dobrik, 21, has also made a name for himself through funny vlogs, many of which feature his relationship with Koshy. Combined, the two have over 21 million subscribers, making them one of the most visible power couples on the platform. Except that the two broke up six months ago, according to a video uploaded yesterday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The split may come as a surprise to some fans, given that the two have been uploading videos with each other this entire time. Just two weeks ago, Dobrik shared footage of him surprising Koshy with a puppy, and before that, there was another video in which he brings her a monkey. But according to the pair, the two had grown apart enough that staying in a relationship just didn\u2019t make sense anymore: they were leading separate lives. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201dLiza broke up with me because she felt like we\u2019ve been kinda distant, because we\u2019ve just been so busy, period,\u201d Dobrik said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The video\u2019s popularity is not entirely thanks to the viewers who normally follow the everyday minutia of their favorite YouTubers. It\u2019s gone viral because of how obvious it is that the two deeply care for one another. They joke around, they crack up, they cry. They sing each other\u2019s praises and talk about how they\u2019re still best friends. They make jabs about future boyfriends and girlfriends. When Koshy says that she is going through something and that she needs to love herself before she can love someone else, she knows it\u2019s clich\u00e9 \u2014 so you believe her. It helps that she pokes fun at herself. \u201cThis is gonna sound so lame, but I really want to spread love but I have to have it first, you know?,\u201d Koshy says, laughing. \u201cIt\u2019s like saying you\u2019re gonna spread mayonnaise when you only have mustard.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Where before partners might consider joining their banking accounts, lovers in 2018 have to think about what it means to merge their brands NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At this point, breakups are their own genre of video on YouTube, and plenty of couples have announced a separation in front of the camera. Where before partners might consider joining things like banking accounts or bills, lovers in 2018 have to think about what it means to merge your brand with someone else\u2019s. You don\u2019t have to be a big YouTube star to think about when you make a relationship Instagram official, how much a partner should be mentioned on your social media feeds, or even what labels you publicly use for one another. To what degree should you own your relationship online? How will that relationship define you in the eyes of others on the internet? Even a simple tagged photo carries a much bigger meaning for some of us. You don\u2019t want to give people the wrong idea about where things stand with certain people \u2014 or maybe you do want to send a very specific message out there. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While most of us can simply stop tagging an ex on our social media accounts, YouTubers with channels revolving around their lives don\u2019t have that luxury. Their entire livelihoods could be at risk if they disappoint or upset the audience following them. As ridiculous as it might sound, there\u2019s a real need for disclosure regarding where they stand with those regularly featured in their videos. If nothing else, airing everything out this publicly is a preventative measure that could minimize the chance that either person will get harassed by fans who believe one person ought to be blamed for the breakup. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Koshy and Dobrik know they\u2019re operating within this strange space. They waited a long time to tell YouTube fans because they were both angry that they grew apart in the first place. And while we all know that what influencers show us is just a well-edited sliver of a much bigger picture, there\u2019s a subtext of realness here. Koshy jokes that she could have wiped away her tears and fix up her appearance, but that wouldn\u2019t be authentic. You believe her. More than that: you can\u2019t help but watch and think, Man, I wish I had had a breakup as healthy as this one.\nPassage 2:\nThis was a very very stupid idea.

It is not a viral challenge video, nor is it something about Fortnite. Instead, it\u2019s a shockingly raw breakup video featuring two of YouTube\u2019s biggest comedy vloggers, Liza Koshy and David Dobrik. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Liza Koshy, 22, is best known for going to stores and causing improvisational mischief, often featuring random items that anyone can buy. David Dobrik, 21, has also made a name for himself through funny vlogs, many of which feature his relationship with Koshy. Combined, the two have over 21 million subscribers, making them one of the most visible power couples on the platform. Except that the two broke up six months ago, according to a video uploaded yesterday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The split may come as a surprise to some fans, given that the two have been uploading videos with each other this entire time. Just two weeks ago, Dobrik shared footage of him surprising Koshy with a puppy, and before that, there was another video in which he brings her a monkey. But according to the pair, the two had grown apart enough that staying in a relationship just didn\u2019t make sense anymore: they were leading separate lives. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201dLiza broke up with me because she felt like we\u2019ve been kinda distant, because we\u2019ve just been so busy, period,\u201d Dobrik said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The video\u2019s popularity is not entirely thanks to the viewers who normally follow the everyday minutia of their favorite YouTubers. It\u2019s gone viral because of how obvious it is that the two deeply care for one another. They joke around, they crack up, they cry. They sing each other\u2019s praises and talk about how they\u2019re still best friends. They make jabs about future boyfriends and girlfriends. When Koshy says that she is going through something and that she needs to love herself before she can love someone else, she knows it\u2019s clich\u00e9 \u2014 so you believe her. It helps that she pokes fun at herself. \u201cThis is gonna sound so lame, but I really want to spread love but I have to have it first, you know?,\u201d Koshy says, laughing. \u201cIt\u2019s like saying you\u2019re gonna spread mayonnaise when you only have mustard.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Where before partners might consider joining their banking accounts, lovers in 2018 have to think about what it means to merge their brands NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At this point, breakups are their own genre of video on YouTube, and plenty of couples have announced a separation in front of the camera. Where before partners might consider joining things like banking accounts or bills, lovers in 2018 have to think about what it means to merge your brand with someone else\u2019s. You don\u2019t have to be a big YouTube star to think about when you make a relationship Instagram official, how much a partner should be mentioned on your social media feeds, or even what labels you publicly use for one another. To what degree should you own your relationship online? How will that relationship define you in the eyes of others on the internet? Even a simple tagged photo carries a much bigger meaning for some of us. You don\u2019t want to give people the wrong idea about where things stand with certain people \u2014 or maybe you do want to send a very specific message out there. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While most of us can simply stop tagging an ex on our social media accounts, YouTubers with channels revolving around their lives don\u2019t have that luxury. Their entire livelihoods could be at risk if they disappoint or upset the audience following them. As ridiculous as it might sound, there\u2019s a real need for disclosure regarding where they stand with those regularly featured in their videos. If nothing else, airing everything out this publicly is a preventative measure that could minimize the chance that either person will get harassed by fans who believe one person ought to be blamed for the breakup. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Koshy and Dobrik know they\u2019re operating within this strange space. They waited a long time to tell YouTube fans because they were both angry that they grew apart in the first place. And while we all know that what influencers show us is just a well-edited sliver of a much bigger picture, there\u2019s a subtext of realness here. Koshy jokes that she could have wiped away her tears and fix up her appearance, but that wouldn\u2019t be authentic. You believe her. More than that: you can\u2019t help but watch and think, Man, I wish I had had a breakup as healthy as this one.\nPassage 2:\nThis was a very very stupid idea.

As the Verge (which calls Koshy and Dobrik \"one of the most visible power couples on the platform\") explains for those unfamiliar, Koshy rocketed to YouTube stardom thanks to prank videos often filmed at stores, while Dobrik's popular video blogs often featured him and Koshy goofing around. Thanks to the intensely public nature of their relationship, it was necessary to come clean to fans about their breakup, which happened six months ago but about which they didn't feel ready to vlog until now.

Write a one-page summary of all news. \n\nNews:\nPassage 1:\nBEIJING \u2014 The United States and China are the world\u2019s two largest economies, two largest consumers of energy, and two largest emitters of greenhouse gases. Together we account for about 40 percent of the world\u2019s emissions. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR We need to solve this problem together because neither one of us can solve it alone. Even if the United States somehow eliminated all of our domestic greenhouse gas emissions, it still wouldn\u2019t be enough to counteract the carbon pollution coming from China and the rest of the world. Likewise, even if China went down to zero emissions, it wouldn\u2019t make enough of a difference if the United States and the rest of the world didn\u2019t change direction. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That\u2019s the reality of what we\u2019re up against. That\u2019s why it matters that the world\u2019s most consequential relationship has just produced something of great consequence in the fight against climate change. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Today, President Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping are jointly announcing targets to reduce carbon emissions in the post-2020 period. By doing this \u2013 together, and well before the deadline established by the international community \u2013 we are encouraging other countries to put forward their own ambitious emissions reduction targets soon and to overcome traditional divisions so we can conclude a strong global climate agreement in 2015. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Our announcement can inject momentum into the global climate negotiations, which resume in less than three weeks in Lima, Peru, and culminate next year in Paris. The commitment of both presidents to take ambitious action in our own countries, and work closely to remove obstacles on the road to Paris, sends an important signal that we must get this agreement done, that we can get it done, and that we will get it done. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Advertisement Continue reading the main story NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This is also a milestone in the United States-China relationship, the outcome of a concerted effort that began last year in Beijing, when State Councilor Yang Jiechi and I started the United States-China Climate Change Working Group. It was an effort inspired not just by our shared concern about the impact of climate change, but by our belief that the world\u2019s largest economies, energy consumers and carbon emitters have a responsibility to lead. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The targets themselves are also important. Ambitious action by our countries together is the foundation to build the low-carbon global economy needed to combat climate change. The United States intends to reduce net greenhouse gas emissions by 26 to 28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025 \u2013 a target that is both ambitious and feasible. It roughly doubles the pace of carbon reductions in the period from 2020 to 2025 as compared to the period from 2005 to 2020. It puts us on a path to transform our economy, with emissions reductions on the order of 80 percent by 2050. It is grounded in an extensive analysis of the potential to reduce emissions in all sectors of our economy, with significant added benefits for health, clean air, and energy security. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Our target builds on the ambitious goal President Obama set in 2009 to cut emissions in the range of 17 percent below 2005 levels by 2020. We are on track to meet that goal, while creating jobs and growing the economy, with the help of a burgeoning clean energy sector. Since the president took office, wind energy production has tripled and solar energy has increased by a factor of ten. This summer, the Environmental Protection Agency proposed the first carbon pollution standards for existing power plants, which account for a third of United States carbon pollution. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Chinese targets also represent a major advance. For the first time China is announcing a peak year for its carbon emissions \u2013 around 2030 \u2013 along with a commitment to try to reach the peak earlier. That matters because over the past 15 years, China has accounted for roughly 60 percent of the growth in carbon dioxide emissions world-wide. We are confident that China can and will reach peak emissions before 2030, in light of President Xi\u2019s commitments to restructure the economy, dramatically reduce air pollution and stimulate an energy revolution. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR China is also announcing today that it would expand the share of total energy consumption coming from zero-emission sources (renewable and nuclear energy) to around 20 percent by 2030, sending a powerful signal to investors and energy markets around the world and helping accelerate the global transition to clean-energy economies. To meet its goal, China will need to deploy an additional 800 to 1,000 gigawatts of nuclear, wind, solar and other renewable generation capacity by 2030 \u2013 an enormous amount, about the same as all the coal-fired power plants in China today, and nearly as much as the total electricity generation capacity of the United States. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There is no question that all of us will need to do more to push toward the de-carbonization of the global economy. But in climate diplomacy, as in life, you have to start at the beginning, and this breakthrough marks a fresh beginning. Two countries regarded for 20 years as the leaders of opposing camps in climate negotiations have come together to find common ground, determined to make lasting progress on an unprecedented global challenge. Let\u2019s ensure that this is the first step toward a world that is more prosperous and more secure.\nPassage 2:\nThe United States and China are pledging to move faster to reduce or limit emissions of heat-trapping gases blamed for global warming. China and the U.S. are the world's two largest polluters, and by taking action together, leaders from both countries hope to spur other nations to be equally aggressive as they work to finalize a worldwide climate treaty next year. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR What both countries are announcing, according to the White House: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR UNITED STATES NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u2014Reduce U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by 26 percent to 28 percent by the year 2025, compared to what the U.S. was emitting in 2005. Previously, Obama had committed to cutting emissions by 17 percent by 2020 compared to 2005 levels, and officials say the U.S. is on track to meet that goal. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u2014Double the rate at which the U.S. is reducing its emissions per year. Between 2005 and 2020, the U.S. on average must cut emissions 1.2 percent per year to meet Obama's overall goal of 17 percent. Over the five years between 2020 and 2025, the U.S. aims to reduce emissions and average of 2.3 percent to 2.8 percent per year. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u2014Submit the new 2025 emissions reduction target by the end of the first quarter of 2015 as the intended U.S. contribution to the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change, the treaty that nations hope to finalize later in 2015 in Paris. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR CHINA NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u2014Set a target for carbon dioxide emissions to peak by around 2030, with the goal of topping out earlier if possible. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u2014Expand the share of China's energy consumption derived from zero-emission sources to about 20 percent by 2030. The U.S. says that would require China to develop up to 1,000 gigawatts of new power from sources like nuclear, wind and solar.\n\n\nNow, write a one-page summary of all the news.\n\nSummary:", "input": "", "context": "Passage 1:\nBEIJING \u2014 The United States and China are the world\u2019s two largest economies, two largest consumers of energy, and two largest emitters of greenhouse gases.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR China is also announcing today that it would expand the share of total energy consumption coming from zero-emission sources (renewable and nuclear energy) to around 20 percent by 2030, sending a powerful signal to investors and energy markets around the world and helping accelerate the global transition to clean-energy economies. To meet its goal, China will need to deploy an additional 800 to 1,000 gigawatts of nuclear, wind, solar and other renewable generation capacity by 2030 \u2013 an enormous amount, about the same as all the coal-fired power plants in China today, and nearly as much as the total electricity generation capacity of the United States. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There is no question that all of us will need to do more to push toward the de-carbonization of the global economy. But in climate diplomacy, as in life, you have to start at the beginning, and this breakthrough marks a fresh beginning. Two countries regarded for 20 years as the leaders of opposing camps in climate negotiations have come together to find common ground, determined to make lasting progress on an unprecedented global challenge. Let\u2019s ensure that this is the first step toward a world that is more prosperous and more secure.\nPassage 2:\nThe United States and China are pledging to move faster to reduce or limit emissions of heat-trapping gases blamed for global warming. China and the U.S. are the world's two largest polluters, and by taking action together, leaders from both countries hope to spur other nations to be equally aggressive as they work to finalize a worldwide climate treaty next year.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u2014Double the rate at which the U.S. is reducing its emissions per year. Between 2005 and 2020, the U.S. on average must cut emissions 1.2 percent per year to meet Obama's overall goal of 17 percent. Over the five years between 2020 and 2025, the U.S. aims to reduce emissions and average of 2.3 percent to 2.8 percent per year. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u2014Submit the new 2025 emissions reduction target by the end of the first quarter of 2015 as the intended U.S. contribution to the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change, the treaty that nations hope to finalize later in 2015 in Paris. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR CHINA NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u2014Set a target for carbon dioxide emissions to peak by around 2030, with the goal of topping out earlier if possible. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u2014Expand the share of China's energy consumption derived from zero-emission sources to about 20 percent by 2030.

The move, which was months in the making, came as a surprise to experts expecting a much more limited scope, the Wall Street Journal reports. Calling it a \"game changer,\" Mother Jones notes that it could heavily influence next year's climate talks in Paris. Key mandates include the US reducing emissions by 26% to 28% by the year 2025 (compared to the year 2005), as well as doubling the rate of emissions reduction each year between 2020 and 2025 to an average 2.3% to 2.8%, the AP reports. China is pledging to stop increasing emissions by 2030 (even earlier, if possible), as well as increase energy from zero-emission sources such as wind, solar, and nuclear to 20% by 2030.

While some voters will feel a bit of a sugar-high from the conventions, the basic structure of the race has not changed significantly. The reality of the Obama economy will reassert itself as the ultimate downfall of the Obama Presidency, and Mitt Romney will win this race. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In his acceptance speech, President Obama did not offer any solutions for the millions of Americans unemployed or underemployed. But his convention speech was not the only big letdown to voters, as Americans also dealt with yet another dismal jobs report last week. President Obama is the only president in modern American history to stand before the American people asking for re-election with this many Americans struggling to find work. The key numbers in this election are the 43 straight months of 8% or higher unemployment, the 23 million Americans struggling to find work, and the 47 million Americans who are on food stamps. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Today, there is no question: Americans are not better off than we were four years ago, and that is why President Obama has struggled in this race. The truth is that some of President Obama\u2019s allies are claiming victory, but others are acknowledging the unsustainable position in which they find themselves. This is evidenced in a recent quote in The New York Times by an Obama Administration official saying, \u201cIt\u2019s certainly not what I would call the position we wanted to be in at this point in the race\u2026He\u2019s going to have to make the case that we wouldn\u2019t even be at 8 percent if it weren\u2019t for him.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Consider the following points: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Obama Economy: The stakes are very high in this election, and voters understand the future of our country is on the line. This may be lost on those living within the hyper-political world in and around the Beltway, but it is not lost in communities in battleground states. In short, the Romney-Ryan campaign understands Americans struggling in the Obama economy will determine the outcome of the race, and once the preponderance of information about the President\u2019s failed policies \u2013 combined with Mitt Romney\u2019s vision to strengthen the middle class \u2013 are communicated, our nation will move in a different direction. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR All Signs Point to a Tight Race: Those watching the daily tracking polls know that, while the President has seen a bounce from his convention, his approval has already begun to slip, indicating it is likely to recede further.

In both states, Pollster.com\u2019s reporting of the most recent statewide polls puts Obama\u2019s lead at only seven points in each of these states. In North Carolina, fresh off of hosting the Democratic National Convention, the Obama campaign is laying the groundwork for a stealth withdrawal. In a state the President won by a mere 14,000 votes in 2008, all one has to do is look at the Obama campaign\u2019s television buy in the state to understand how they view their chances there. The Obama campaign\u2019s North Carolina television buy has dropped 35% compared to June, and they have run more than twice as much advertising over the past two weeks in Rochester, Minnesota (hitting a small slice of Iowa), than they have in any North Carolina market. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Historical Data: Political campaign historians will recall President Jimmy Carter led Ronald Reagan by a near double digit margin late in the fall in 1980. In that race, the voters made their decision based on the key issues confronting the nation and it determined the outcome. On the economy, the most important issue of this race, Mitt Romney leads by 51%-45%, according to the most recent CNN/ORC poll. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Targeted Campaign: The Romney-Ryan campaign is running deeply local and targeted efforts in each of the states focusing on the voter groups that will make the difference on Election Day. Anyone asserting a \u201cone-size-fits-all-campaign\u201d effort is being put forward is simply misinformed, as evidenced by the 15 different ads released by the Romney Ryan campaign this past Friday and now running in nine states, including Wisconsin. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR New Money Advantage: All of this is not possible without resources, and the Romney-Ryan campaign and the Republican Party have a real advantage. In August alone, the Romney Victory effort raised more than $111 million, marking the third straight fundraising month of more than $100 million, putting us on a very strong financial footing for the final two months. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Energy and Enthusiasm: CNN/ORC\u2019s most recent polling shows that 62% of Republicans are \u201cextremely\u201d or \u201cvery\u201d excited about this election, while only 56% of Democrats report being \u201cextremely\u201d or \u201cvery\u201d excited. This Republican enthusiasm advantage has manifested itself in an unprecedented and historic grassroots effort that will have a significant impact on turnout in battleground states on Election Day. For instance, as of today, Victory volunteers have already knocked on more doors than during the entire 2008 campaign. (2.72 million in 2012 through September 8 compared to 2.43 million overall in 2008.) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Romney\u2019s Ground Game: During last weekend\u2019s \u201cSuper Saturday,\u201d we crossed the 20 million volunteer voter contact threshold. Also, the Romney campaign knocked on more doors last week than in any week during the 2008 campaign. More than 55,000 volunteers have knocked doors or made phone calls for Victory this year and that number is growing by the week. And volunteers have collected person-to-person identification information on nearly 1.7 million swing voters in battleground states thus far. And the numbers are even more startling when one looks at individual states. For instance, in Ohio alone, five times more phone calls and 28 times more door knocks have been made than at this time in 2008. This past Saturday, more than 100,000 doors were knocked on by Victory volunteers in the Buckeye State. And in Wisconsin, five times more phone calls and 72 times more door knocks have been made than at this time in 2008. And the list goes on and on. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mitt Romney will be the next President. The outcome of this race will ultimately be determined in favor of Governor Romney because he has the better leadership skills, the better record, and the better vision for where he wants to take the country. These advantages are being fueled by the commitment and determination of volunteers and voters to change direction and move our country on a path toward economic growth and job creation. In short, the combination of having the superior candidate, being in a margin-of-error race with an incumbent President, having a cash advantage, and having an unprecedented grassroots effort and a winning message on the economy ensure that Americans will make a change in leadership in Washington on November 6.\nPassage 2:\nAP NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Mitt Romney campaign circulated a statement Monday from its pollster, Neil Newhouse, conceding that President Barack Obama \"has seen a bounce from his convention\" in daily tracking polls but urging readers not to \"get too worked up about the latest polling.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Newhouse characterized the recent shift to Obama as \"a bit of a sugar-high from the conventions\" and argued that the \"basic structure of the race has not changed significantly\": NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR All Signs Point to a Tight Race: Those watching the daily tracking polls know that, while the President has seen a bounce from his convention, his approval has already begun to slip, indicating it is likely to recede further.

There was a Columbus Post-Dispatch poll last week that had it 45-45. That's a more accurate picture of the state of the play there than any of the spin. PPP has these polls that just put chum in the water for the media. Sometimes I think there's a conscious effort between the media and Chicago to get Republicans depressed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A poll tracking model created for HuffPost Pollster by political scientist Simon Jackman, based on all polling at the national and state levels, shows that the conventions have helped boost Obama's share of the vote to his highest levels since early March. The model currently has Obama leading Romney by 3 percentage points.\nPassage 3:\nI asked a top Romney adviser what he makes of reports that the Romney campaign knows it\u2019s losing and that Ohio is slipping out of reach (PPP has a new poll with Obama at 50 in the state): NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It\u2019s horses**t.

And I hope our friends realize that all these media analysts out there are Democrats WHO WANT US TO LOSE. And the more Washington DC controls our economy, the more important inside-the-beltway publications are and the more money they make. The 202 area code is dominated by people who will make more money if Obama is reelected, so it\u2019s not just an ideological thumb they\u2019re putting on the scale for him, it\u2019s a business interest. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I actually think the other side is in a panic. You look at New Mexico closing up. And they\u2019re not above 50 in any of their target states.

Write a one-page summary of all news. \n\nNews:\nPassage 1:\nImportance The National Action Plan for Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria set a goal of reducing inappropriate outpatient antibiotic use by 50% by 2020, but the extent of inappropriate outpatient antibiotic use is unknown. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Objective To estimate the rates of outpatient oral antibiotic prescribing by age and diagnosis, and the estimated portions of antibiotic use that may be inappropriate in adults and children in the United States. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Design, Setting, and Participants Using the 2010-2011 National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey and National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, annual numbers and population-adjusted rates with 95% confidence intervals of ambulatory visits with oral antibiotic prescriptions by age, region, and diagnosis in the United States were estimated. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Exposures Ambulatory care visits. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Main Outcomes and Measures Based on national guidelines and regional variation in prescribing, diagnosis-specific prevalence and rates of total and appropriate antibiotic prescriptions were determined. These rates were combined to calculate an estimate of the appropriate annual rate of antibiotic prescriptions per 1000 population. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Results Of the 184 032 sampled visits, 12.6% of visits (95% CI, 12.0%-13.3%) resulted in antibiotic prescriptions. Sinusitis was the single diagnosis associated with the most antibiotic prescriptions per 1000 population (56 antibiotic prescriptions [95% CI, 48-64]), followed by suppurative otitis media (47 antibiotic prescriptions [95% CI, 41-54]), and pharyngitis (43 antibiotic prescriptions [95% CI, 38-49]). Collectively, acute respiratory conditions per 1000 population led to 221 antibiotic prescriptions (95% CI, 198-245) annually, but only 111 antibiotic prescriptions were estimated to be appropriate for these conditions. Per 1000 population, among all conditions and ages combined in 2010-2011, an estimated 506 antibiotic prescriptions (95% CI, 458-554) were written annually, and, of these, 353 antibiotic prescriptions were estimated to be appropriate antibiotic prescriptions. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Conclusions and Relevance In the United States in 2010-2011, there was an estimated annual antibiotic prescription rate per 1000 population of 506, but only an estimated 353 antibiotic prescriptions were likely appropriate, supporting the need for establishing a goal for outpatient antibiotic stewardship.\nPassage 2:\nMAY 02, 2016 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Allison Gilchrist, Associate Editor NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR About 30% of all outpatient oral antibiotic prescriptions written in the United States are inappropriate, a new CDC study suggests.CDC researchers used data from the 2010-2011 National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey and National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey to determine the rates of outpatient oral antibiotic prescribing by patient age and diagnosis, as well as the estimated amount of antibiotic use that could be considered inappropriate.Of the 184,032 outpatient visits included in the data, 12.6% resulted in an antibiotic prescription. The researchers estimated that 353 of the 506 antibiotic prescriptions written annually per 1000 population were appropriate.Broken down further, the data revealed that sinusitis diagnoses resulted in the most antibiotic prescriptions per 1000 population (56), followed by ear infections (47), and pharyngitis (43).\u201cHalf of antibiotic prescriptions for acute respiratory conditions may have been unnecessary, representing 34 million antibiotic prescriptions annually,\u201d the researchers wrote. \u201cCollectively across all conditions, an estimated 30% of outpatient oral antibiotic prescriptions may have been inappropriate.\u201dLast fall, the President signed an Executive Order on \u201cdetecting, preventing, and controlling antibiotic-resistant microbes\u201d as part of the White House\u2019s 5-year National Action Plan for Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria, which aims to reduce inappropriate antibiotic use in outpatient settings by 50% by 2020. Based on the current study results, a 15% reduction in overall antibiotic use would be necessary in order to meet that goal, the researchers noted.Because antibiotic overprescribing contributes to drug resistance, curbing the practice is a major public health care priority. Failure to do so could have grim consequences, as the CDC already estimates that 2 million individuals are infected with antibiotic-resistant bacteria each year in the United States, and 23,000 of them die from these infections annually.In one of the more notorious examples , UCLA Health indicated that 179 patients might have been infected with \u201c superbug \u201d carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae at the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center during \u201ccomplex endoscopic procedures that took place between October 2014 and January 2015.\u201d\u201cHealth professionals generally know when antibiotics are and are not needed,\u201d lead study author Katherine Fleming-Dutra, MD, a medical epidemiologist with the CDC\u2019s Office of Antibiotic Stewardship, explained to Pharmacy Times. \u201cOften, clinicians are worried about patient satisfaction. They think that a patient wants antibiotics\u2026sometimes leading them to prescribe when they shouldn\u2019t.\u201dPharmacists can help prevent this by providing patients with information about the potential consequences of unnecessary antibiotic use.\u201cPharmacists are the last health professional to see a patient when an antibiotic is prescribed,\u201d Dr. Fleming-Dutra said. \u201cWhen dispensing antibiotics, pharmacists can educate patients about properly taking antibiotics and about potential harms from antibiotics such as allergies, adverse events, and antibiotic resistance.\u201dBeyond treating infections, other studies have found that as many as 1 in 10 health care providers prescribe antibiotics for almost every patient they see with a cold or bronchitis, despite the fact that antibiotics aren\u2019t effective against viral infections.\u201cIt is important for all health professionals in all regions seeing patients of all ages to only prescribe antibiotics when they are needed, and if needed, select the right antibiotic at the right dose for the right duration,\u201d Dr. Fleming-Dutra advised.The current study results appeared in the May 3, 2016, edition of JAMA.\nPassage 3:\nWASHINGTON\u2014The Pew Charitable Trusts and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released today a first-of-its kind analysis of antibiotic use in doctors\u2019 offices, emergency rooms, and hospital-based clinics in the United States. The analysis, conducted in partnership with a panel of leading antibiotic use experts, identifies acute respiratory conditions as key drivers of antibiotic overuse in human health care and establishes data-driven targets for eliminating the approximately 47 million unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions issued in outpatient facilities across the country every year. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The findings are outlined in two documents released today: Pew\u2019s report \u201cAntibiotic Use in Outpatient Settings\u201d and \u201cPrevalence of Inappropriate Antibiotic Prescriptions Among U.S. Ambulatory Care Visits, 2010-2011,\u201d an article authored by experts from Pew, CDC, and members of the panel, appearing in the current issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association. They outline the baseline analysis and condition-specific targets, as well as practical strategies to improve prescribing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cThis report provides the most in-depth picture to date of outpatient antibiotic prescriptions in the U.S. and will serve as a benchmark in measuring progress moving forward,\u201d said David Hyun, M.D., a senior officer with Pew\u2019s antibiotic resistance project, who focuses on research and policy development pertaining to the stewardship of antibiotics in health care settings. \u201cWhile our estimates of unnecessary antibiotic use are conservative, it is clear that a small number of health conditions constitute the lion\u2019s share of unwarranted antibiotic prescriptions in this country. These detailed data will help health care providers target stewardship efforts where they can do the most good.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At least 30 percent of antibiotics prescribed in outpatient settings in the United States are unnecessary, according to the report. The majority are prescribed for acute respiratory conditions such as colds, sore throats, bronchitis, flu, and other viral illnesses that do not respond to antibiotics. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cThe more antibiotics are used, the less effective they become. Reducing the needless use of antibiotics will slow the emergence of antibiotic-resistant microbes, so-called superbugs, which are among the most urgent public health threats of our time,\u201d said Kathy Talkington, director of Pew\u2019s antibiotic resistance project. \u201cPatients and health care providers must work together to understand when antibiotics will help and when they won\u2019t, and help preserve these lifesaving drugs for patients who really need them.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Antibiotic use in outpatient settings represents the majority of dollars spent on antibiotics for human health care in the United States, and outpatient providers are often the first place patients go for health care when suffering from a cold, flu, sore throat, or other common condition for which antibiotics are often unnecessarily prescribed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The analysis concludes that: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Approximately 13 percent of all outpatient office visits in the United States, or about 154 million visits annually, result in an antibiotic prescription; about 30 percent of these prescriptions are unnecessary. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Forty-four percent of outpatient antibiotic prescriptions are written to treat patients with acute respiratory conditions, such as sinus infections, middle ear infections, pharyngitis, viral upper respiratory infections (i.e., the common cold), bronchitis, bronchiolitis, asthma, allergies, influenza, and pneumonia. Half of these prescriptions are unnecessary. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In 2015, the White House released a national action plan for combating antibiotic resistance, which included the goal of reducing inappropriate outpatient antibiotic use by 50 percent by 2020. Based on the panel\u2019s estimate of unnecessary prescribing, this goal would be reached by reducing outpatient antibiotic use by 15 percent overall, which would result in approximately 23 million fewer antibiotics prescribed annually by 2020. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The panel outlined actions that health care providers, patients, and the health care industry as a whole can take to reach the targets, including: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Individual outpatient health care providers can evaluate their own prescribing habits as well as implement stewardship activities in their practices. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Health systems can provide expertise and resources to offices within their network to aid in stewardship implementation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Health plans can assist in data collection and analysis\u2014evaluating the antibiotic prescribing habits of their providers and providing feedback that highlights potential areas for improvement. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR State and local health agencies can help provide outpatient facilities with information on best practices for implementing antibiotic stewardship programs, and help develop regional partnerships between various health care stakeholders, such as providers, health plans, and health systems, in order to better coordinate stewardship activities. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Federal agencies can track antibiotic prescribing at the national level, identifying areas for further improvement and providing technical assistance to stakeholders interested in implementing stewardship efforts of their own. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Organizations such as the National Committee for Quality Assurance that develop standards to assess the quality of health care services can establish metrics to assess the antibiotic prescribing habits of health care providers. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Health care professional societies can provide expert guidance to their members on appropriate antibiotic prescribing and incorporating diagnostics to aid in prescribing decision-making. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cPrescribing unnecessary antibiotics is just one element of inappropriate use of antibiotics,\u201d said Lauri Hicks, D.O., director of the CDC\u2019s Office of Antibiotic Stewardship in the Division of Healthcare Quality Promotion, National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases. \u201cHealth care providers can also prescribe antibiotics at the wrong dose or for the wrong duration, amplifying the extent of inappropriate use. Setting a national target to reduce unnecessary antibiotic use is the first step, and we must work together across the health care continuum to reach this goal.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Pew, CDC, and the expert panel are preparing a similar report on inpatient antibiotic prescribing. It will set national targets for reducing unnecessary use in hospitals and will be released in 2017.

In 2013, CDC published a comprehensive analysis outlining the top 18 antibiotic-resistant threats in the U.S., titled Antibiotic Resistance Threats in the United States, 2013 (AR Threats Report). The report sounded the alarm to the danger of antibiotic resistance, stating that each year in the U.S., at least 2 million people get an antibiotic-resistant infection, and at least 23,000 people die. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The report ranked the 18 threats (bacteria and fungi) into three categories based on level of concern to human health\u2014urgent, serious, and concerning\u2014and identified: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Minimum estimates of morbidity and mortality from antibiotic-resistant infections NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR People at especially high risk NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Gaps in knowledge about antibiotic resistance NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Core actions to prevent infections caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria, and slow spread of resistance NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR What CDC was doing at that time to combat the threat of antibiotic resistance NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The data below is pulled from the 2013 Threats Report. CDC is working towards releasing an updated AR Threats Report in fall 2019.\nPassage 5:\nNEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR iStock NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This post has been updated. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Nearly a third of antibiotics prescribed in doctors' offices, emergency rooms and hospital-based clinics in the United States are not needed, according to the most in-depth study yet to examine the use and misuse of these life-saving drugs. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The finding, which has implications for antibiotics' diminished efficacy, translates to about 47 million unnecessary prescriptions given out each year across the country to children and adults. Most of these are for conditions that don't respond to antibiotics, such as colds, sore throats, bronchitis, flu and other viral illnesses. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Although health officials have been warning for decades about the overuse of antibiotics and its contribution to the development of drug-resistant bacteria, the research from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Pew Charitable Trust is the first to quantify the depth of the problem. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We've all been hearing, 'This is a problem, this is problem,' and we all understood the general concept that there is a lot of antibiotic use,\" said David Hyun, a senior officer with Pew's antibiotic resistance project and one of the authors of the report published Tuesday in JAMA. Pew also published a companion report using the same data. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Why this study is so important: It actually provides concrete numbers,\" Hyun said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR [CDC warns that Americans may be overmedicating young children with ADHD] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The study analyzed data for all antibiotic use in the three settings as collected from two major CDC surveys from 2010 to 2011. Antibiotic prescriptions written there represent the majority of dollars spent on antibiotics in this country. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cAntibiotics are life-saving drugs, and if we continue down the road of inappropriate use we\u2019ll lose the most powerful tool we have to fight life-threatening infections,\u201d said CDC Director Tom Frieden. \u201cLosing these antibiotics would undermine our ability to treat patients with deadly infections [and] cancer, provide organ transplants and save victims of burns and trauma.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR [\u2018Looming catastrophe\u2019: These 7 emergency surgeries account for 80 percent of deaths and costs] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Among the key findings: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u2022 About 13 percent of all outpatient visits in the United States -- about 154 million visits annually -- result in an antibiotic prescription. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u2022 More than four in 10 (44 percent) of antibiotic prescriptions are written to treat patients with acute respiratory conditions, such as sinus infections, middle ear infections, sore throats, colds, bronchitis, asthma, allergies, flu, and pneumonia. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u2022 Half of these prescriptions are unnecessary because many are for viral illnesses. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Doctors often wind up prescribing antibiotics because of pressure from patients or parents, said Katherine Fleming-Dutra, a CDC medical epidemiologist and report's lead author. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Clinicians are concerned about patient satisfaction and the patient demand for antibiotics,\" she said. But the majority of individuals do trust their doctors to make the right diagnosis, and better communication by doctors about the dangers of antibiotic overuse can lead to more appropriate prescribing, she said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR An accompanying editorial in JAMA noted that the numbers provided in the report likely are an undercount because they don't include the times antibiotics are given when patients talk to doctors' offices over the telephone, or when patients seek medical care at urgent care clinics, retail pharmacies and dentists' offices. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Also not included are prescriptions written by nurse practitioners and physician assistants. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But even relatively simple steps, such as displaying a poster in patient waiting rooms can cut down on antibiotic prescribing, the editorial said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The overuse of antibiotics has led to the frightening rise of drug-resistant superbugs in recent years. The CDC has warned that \"nightmare bacteria\" are increasingly resistant to even the strongest antibiotics, posing a growing threat to hospitals and nursing homes nationwide. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Last year, the White House announced an aggressive plan to combat antibiotic-resistant bacteria, which already cause an estimated 2 million illnesses and 23,000 deaths every year just in the United States. The administration set a target of reducing inappropriate antibiotic use in outpatient settings by half by 2020. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Based on the new report, this goal would be reached by cutting outpatient antibiotic use by 15 percent overall, which would result in approximately 23 million fewer antibiotics prescribed annually by 2020.

Reducing the needless use of antibiotics will slow the emergence of antibiotic-resistant microbes, so-called superbugs, which are among the most urgent public health threats of our time,\u201d said Kathy Talkington, director of Pew\u2019s antibiotic resistance project. \u201cPatients and health care providers must work together to understand when antibiotics will help and when they won\u2019t, and help preserve these lifesaving drugs for patients who really need them.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Antibiotic use in outpatient settings represents the majority of dollars spent on antibiotics for human health care in the United States, and outpatient providers are often the first place patients go for health care when suffering from a cold, flu, sore throat, or other common condition for which antibiotics are often unnecessarily prescribed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The analysis concludes that: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Approximately 13 percent of all outpatient office visits in the United States, or about 154 million visits annually, result in an antibiotic prescription; about 30 percent of these prescriptions are unnecessary. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Forty-four percent of outpatient antibiotic prescriptions are written to treat patients with acute respiratory conditions, such as sinus infections, middle ear infections, pharyngitis, viral upper respiratory infections (i.e., the common cold), bronchitis, bronchiolitis, asthma, allergies, influenza, and pneumonia. Half of these prescriptions are unnecessary. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In 2015, the White House released a national action plan for combating antibiotic resistance, which included the goal of reducing inappropriate outpatient antibiotic use by 50 percent by 2020. Based on the panel\u2019s estimate of unnecessary prescribing, this goal would be reached by reducing outpatient antibiotic use by 15 percent overall, which would result in approximately 23 million fewer antibiotics prescribed annually by 2020. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The panel outlined actions that health care providers, patients, and the health care industry as a whole can take to reach the targets, including: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Individual outpatient health care providers can evaluate their own prescribing habits as well as implement stewardship activities in their practices. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Health systems can provide expertise and resources to offices within their network to aid in stewardship implementation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Health plans can assist in data collection and analysis\u2014evaluating the antibiotic prescribing habits of their providers and providing feedback that highlights potential areas for improvement. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR State and local health agencies can help provide outpatient facilities with information on best practices for implementing antibiotic stewardship programs, and help develop regional partnerships between various health care stakeholders, such as providers, health plans, and health systems, in order to better coordinate stewardship activities. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Federal agencies can track antibiotic prescribing at the national level, identifying areas for further improvement and providing technical assistance to stakeholders interested in implementing stewardship efforts of their own. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Organizations such as the National Committee for Quality Assurance that develop standards to assess the quality of health care services can establish metrics to assess the antibiotic prescribing habits of health care providers. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Health care professional societies can provide expert guidance to their members on appropriate antibiotic prescribing and incorporating diagnostics to aid in prescribing decision-making. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cPrescribing unnecessary antibiotics is just one element of inappropriate use of antibiotics,\u201d said Lauri Hicks, D.O., director of the CDC\u2019s Office of Antibiotic Stewardship in the Division of Healthcare Quality Promotion, National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases. \u201cHealth care providers can also prescribe antibiotics at the wrong dose or for the wrong duration, amplifying the extent of inappropriate use. Setting a national target to reduce unnecessary antibiotic use is the first step, and we must work together across the health care continuum to reach this goal.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Pew, CDC, and the expert panel are preparing a similar report on inpatient antibiotic prescribing.

In 2013, CDC published a comprehensive analysis outlining the top 18 antibiotic-resistant threats in the U.S., titled Antibiotic Resistance Threats in the United States, 2013 (AR Threats Report). The report sounded the alarm to the danger of antibiotic resistance, stating that each year in the U.S., at least 2 million people get an antibiotic-resistant infection, and at least 23,000 people die. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The report ranked the 18 threats (bacteria and fungi) into three categories based on level of concern to human health\u2014urgent, serious, and concerning\u2014and identified: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Minimum estimates of morbidity and mortality from antibiotic-resistant infections NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR People at especially high risk NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Gaps in knowledge about antibiotic resistance NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Core actions to prevent infections caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria, and slow spread of resistance NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR What CDC was doing at that time to combat the threat of antibiotic resistance NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The data below is pulled from the 2013 Threats Report. CDC is working towards releasing an updated AR Threats Report in fall 2019.\nPassage 5:\nNEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR iStock NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This post has been updated. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Nearly a third of antibiotics prescribed in doctors' offices, emergency rooms and hospital-based clinics in the United States are not needed, according to the most in-depth study yet to examine the use and misuse of these life-saving drugs. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The finding, which has implications for antibiotics' diminished efficacy, translates to about 47 million unnecessary prescriptions given out each year across the country to children and adults. Most of these are for conditions that don't respond to antibiotics, such as colds, sore throats, bronchitis, flu and other viral illnesses. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Although health officials have been warning for decades about the overuse of antibiotics and its contribution to the development of drug-resistant bacteria, the research from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Pew Charitable Trust is the first to quantify the depth of the problem. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We've all been hearing, 'This is a problem, this is problem,' and we all understood the general concept that there is a lot of antibiotic use,\" said David Hyun, a senior officer with Pew's antibiotic resistance project and one of the authors of the report published Tuesday in JAMA. Pew also published a companion report using the same data. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Why this study is so important: It actually provides concrete numbers,\" Hyun said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR [CDC warns that Americans may be overmedicating young children with ADHD] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The study analyzed data for all antibiotic use in the three settings as collected from two major CDC surveys from 2010 to 2011. Antibiotic prescriptions written there represent the majority of dollars spent on antibiotics in this country. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cAntibiotics are life-saving drugs, and if we continue down the road of inappropriate use we\u2019ll lose the most powerful tool we have to fight life-threatening infections,\u201d said CDC Director Tom Frieden. \u201cLosing these antibiotics would undermine our ability to treat patients with deadly infections [and] cancer, provide organ transplants and save victims of burns and trauma.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR [\u2018Looming catastrophe\u2019: These 7 emergency surgeries account for 80 percent of deaths and costs] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Among the key findings: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u2022 About 13 percent of all outpatient visits in the United States -- about 154 million visits annually -- result in an antibiotic prescription. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u2022 More than four in 10 (44 percent) of antibiotic prescriptions are written to treat patients with acute respiratory conditions, such as sinus infections, middle ear infections, sore throats, colds, bronchitis, asthma, allergies, flu, and pneumonia. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u2022 Half of these prescriptions are unnecessary because many are for viral illnesses. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Doctors often wind up prescribing antibiotics because of pressure from patients or parents, said Katherine Fleming-Dutra, a CDC medical epidemiologist and report's lead author. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Clinicians are concerned about patient satisfaction and the patient demand for antibiotics,\" she said. But the majority of individuals do trust their doctors to make the right diagnosis, and better communication by doctors about the dangers of antibiotic overuse can lead to more appropriate prescribing, she said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR An accompanying editorial in JAMA noted that the numbers provided in the report likely are an undercount because they don't include the times antibiotics are given when patients talk to doctors' offices over the telephone, or when patients seek medical care at urgent care clinics, retail pharmacies and dentists' offices. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Also not included are prescriptions written by nurse practitioners and physician assistants. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But even relatively simple steps, such as displaying a poster in patient waiting rooms can cut down on antibiotic prescribing, the editorial said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The overuse of antibiotics has led to the frightening rise of drug-resistant superbugs in recent years. The CDC has warned that \"nightmare bacteria\" are increasingly resistant to even the strongest antibiotics, posing a growing threat to hospitals and nursing homes nationwide. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Last year, the White House announced an aggressive plan to combat antibiotic-resistant bacteria, which already cause an estimated 2 million illnesses and 23,000 deaths every year just in the United States. The administration set a target of reducing inappropriate antibiotic use in outpatient settings by half by 2020. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Based on the new report, this goal would be reached by cutting outpatient antibiotic use by 15 percent overall, which would result in approximately 23 million fewer antibiotics prescribed annually by 2020.

The latest CDC data finds that 2 million people a year in the US are infected with bacteria resistant to antibiotics, and at least 23,000 die directly from those infections. And a new report from the CDC and the Pew Charitable Trusts\u2014the first research to quantify this issue, per the Washington Post\u2014isn't encouraging. A study published Tuesday in JAMA finds nearly one in three antibiotic prescriptions (around 47 million per year) are given needlessly to people with viruses such as bronchitis and the common cold, as well as for ear and sinus infections and sore throats not caused by bacterial infections\u2014meaning the Rx not only won't vanquish their illness, but can potentially build up antibiotic resistance, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. Besides the drug resistance, overuse can up the risk for drug allergies and even an unpleasant-sounding diarrhea that can be fatal. The researchers analyzed 184,032 outpatient visits to ERs and medical clinics in 2010 and 2011 and found that 12.6% walked out with an antibiotic script, per the Pharmacy Times. Out of an estimated annual antibiotic-prescription rate of 506 per every 1,000 people, only about 353 of those who received prescriptions should likely have received them. The Times notes President Obama's initiative to cut down on unnecessary outpatient antibiotic use by 50% by 2020; researchers say that, based on this study, we'll need to slash overall antibiotic use by 15% to meet that. \"If we continue down the road of inappropriate use we'll lose the most powerful tool we have to fight life-threatening infections,\" CDC Director Tom Frieden says. \"Losing these antibiotics would undermine our ability to treat patients with deadly infections [and] cancer, provide organ transplants, and save victims of burns and trauma.\" (Here's hoping teixobactin can help us out with superbugs.)"], "length": 3153, "dataset": "multi_news_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "4f9fb40ba3a4ea202edfe8c7c1c19c80a5afa8f0ffb8d9a2", "pred": " \n\nThe misuse of antibiotics is a significant public health concern, with nearly a third of antibiotics prescribed in outpatient settings in the United States being unnecessary.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cWhy now? Why did it happen today?\u201d Schumer asked, noting that if the Clinton missteps were the true reason, the Trump administration could have dismissed him in January. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The leader of the Senate Democrats also expressed fears that the decision would create a chilling effect for next FBI director, who could fear getting fired if they \u201crun afoul of the administration.\u201d He also questioned why Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who publicly recused himself from overseeing the Russia investigation in March, \u201cplayed a role in firing the man leading it.\u201d Schumer called the decision part of a \u201cdeeply troubling pattern,\u201d noting the recent firings of two other top officials involved in investigating the Trump administration: U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York Preet Bharara and Acting Attorney General Sally Yates. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Schumer was one of a small handful of officials Trump called personally earlier on Tuesday to give a heads up about Comey\u2019s firing.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cThe only way the American people can have faith in this investigation going forward is to have a fearless, independent special prosector,\u201d he said.\nPassage 2:\nWashington (CNN) President Donald Trump on Tuesday fired FBI Director James Comey , sweeping away the man who is responsible for the bureau's investigation into whether members of his campaign team colluded with Russia in its interference in last year's election. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The bombshell announcement that sent shock and surprise ricocheting through Washington ends the career of the man who was once seen as the unimpeachable and nonpartisan ideal of how a law enforcement officer should behave. But Comey saw his reputation tarnished when he was dragged into the toxic politics of the 2016 campaign. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Trump administration attributed Comey's dismissal to his handling of the investigation into Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton's email server, but Democrats ridiculed that notion, raising parallels to Watergate-era firings and suggested Comey was getting too close to the White House with the Russia probe. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In any case, senior White House officials appeared to have badly misjudged the impact of Trump's sudden move. A source with knowledge of discussions inside the White House told CNN's Dana Bash that the thinking was that because Democrats were saying precisely what Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said in a letter explaining the grounds for Comey's dismissal, there would be no backlash. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR What was not thought through, apparently, was an explanation of why Comey was fired now, at a time when critics would immediately conclude it was because of the Russia probe. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In recent days, Comey again came under fire for his handling of the investigation into Clinton's private email server. Many Democrats believe that his announcement that he was reopening the probe 11 days before the election cost the former secretary of state the presidency. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump referred to Democrats' criticism of Comey Wednesday morning, tweeting, \"The Democrats have said some of the worst things about James Comey, including the fact that he should be fired, but now they play so sad!\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Democrats have said some of the worst things about James Comey, including the fact that he should be fired, but now they play so sad! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 10, 2017 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Comey learned of his dismissal from televisions tuned to the news, as he was addressing the workforce at the FBI office in Los Angeles, law enforcement sources said. The source said he made a joke about it to lighten the mood and called his office to get confirmation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Longtime Trump ally Roger Stone was among those who recommended to the President that he fire Comey, according to a source familiar with the conversation. Stone, who also is being scrutinized by the FBI as part of its Russia investigation, spoke to Trump after Comey appeared at a hearing last week on Capitol Hill, according to the source. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump immediately disputed that Stone was involved: \"The Roger Stone report on @CNN is false - Fake News. Have not spoken to Roger in a long time - had nothing to do with my decision.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Roger Stone report on @CNN is false - Fake News. Have not spoken to Roger in a long time - had nothing to do with my decision. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 10, 2017 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Stone said he was not the source behind the reporting but added that he supported the firing of Comey \"100%.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A White House spokesperson reached out to CNN to reiterate the President's tweet that he has not spoken to Stone in a \"long time,\" adding, \"The President has not spoken to Roger Stone in many months and any reports suggesting otherwise are categorically untrue.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The letters NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In a signed letter released by the White House, Trump informed Comey that he was \"hereby terminated and removed from office, effective immediately,\" explaining that he reached the conclusion that Comey is \"not able to effectively lead the bureau.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It is essential that we find new leadership for the FBI that restores public trust and confidence in its vital law enforcement mission,\" Trump told Comey in the letter. \"I wish you the best of luck in your future endeavors.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR White House press secretary Sean Spicer, sandwiched in the dark between a gaggle of reporters and a large shrub on the White House driveway, described Trump's decision as arriving only after a long memo from the deputy attorney general, which Spicer said was delivered Tuesday, detailing Comey's shortcomings on investigating Clinton's emails. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But multiple White House officials said Trump had been considering firing Comey for at least a week before he made Tuesday's decision. Indeed, Trump revealed his anger in a string of late-night messages on Twitter May 2, exactly a week before his final decision was made public. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At the center of Rosenstein's rationale for recommending Comey's firing was the director's handling of the investigation into Clinton's private server, namely his decision to recommend no charges be filed and the news conference he held to explain his reasoning. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR JUST WATCHED Senator calls Comey firing 'shocking' Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Senator calls Comey firing 'shocking' 01:03 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Rosenstein accused Comey of attempting to \"usurp the attorney general's authority\" by publicly announcing why he felt the case should be closed without prosecution. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Compounding the error, the director ignored another longstanding principle: We do not hold press conferences to release derogatory information about the subject of a declined criminal investigation,\" Rosenstein argued in his memo. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We should reject the departure and return to the traditions (of the bureau),\" Rosenstein said. \"The way the director handled the conclusion of the email investigation was wrong. As a result, the FBI is unlikely to regain public and congressional trust until it has a director who understands the gravity of the mistakes and pledges never to repeat them.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Congressional reaction NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said he told Trump on the telephone that he had made a terrible mistake. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Were these investigations getting too close to home for the President?\" Schumer asked. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And in a sign of possible trouble for the administration, Republican Sen. Richard Burr, who is leading a Senate intelligence committee probe into alleged Russian influence on the election, expressed disquiet at the firing of Comey, which he described as a \"loss for the bureau and the nation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I am troubled by the timing and reasoning of Director Comey's termination. I have found Director Comey to be a public servant of the highest order, and his dismissal further confuses an already difficult investigation by the Committee,\" Burr said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As Democrats renewed their demands for a special counsel, arguing that the Trump Justice Department could not be trusted to oversee the case, Republicans insisted that one was not needed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I think Rod Rosenstein, the new deputy attorney general, is competent to lead that effort,\" said Texas Sen. John Cornyn, a member of the GOP leadership. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But Republican Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker of Tennessee said that though Rosenstein's rationale for removing Comey was sound, it, would \"raise questions.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sen. John McCain added: \"While the President has the legal authority to remove the director of the FBI, I am disappointed in the President's decision to remove James Comey from office.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Arizona senator renewed his request for a special congressional committee to review the Russia allegations. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'Absurd' NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR CNN's senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin was not buying the idea that Comey was sacked over the Clinton investigation, saying it was \"absurd.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Toobin branded the move a \"grotesque abuse of power by the President of the United States.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"This is not something that is within the American political tradition,\" Toobin said, comparing the sacking of Comey to President Richard Nixon's firing of special prosecutor Archibald Cox during the Watergate scandal. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"This is not normal. This is not politics as usual,\" said Toobin, though he added that Trump did have the legal authority to fire an FBI director. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The White House, however, said that the impetus for the firing of Comey came from Rosenstein, noting that he was a career prosecutor who served under President Barack Obama as the US Attorney for Maryland, and was confirmed in his new job on April 25. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A senior administration official said that Rosenstein assessed the situation upon taking office and concluded the FBI director had lost his confidence. He sent his recommendation to Sessions -- who has recused himself from the Russia investigation since he was a Trump adviser and campaign surrogate -- who forwarded it to Trump, who accepted it on Tuesday.

MUST WATCH Toobin: Trump admin going to put a stooge in 01:26 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Team Clinton reaction NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Former Clinton campaign officials accused Trump of using the furor over Comey's handling of the email server as a ruse to get out from under the Russia investigation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I was as frustrated, concerned and disappointed as anyone with Director Comey's handling of the email investigation, but President Trump just fired the man investigating how Russia meddled in our election and whether members of his campaign were involved, an investigation President Trump called a \"charade\" only 24 hours ago,\" said Clinton's former campaign manager, Robby Mook. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It's equally concerning that our attorney general, who lied about his own meetings with the Russians, approved Director Comey's firing,\" he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR One Trump loyalist, who worked on the campaign and the transition, gave his reaction to CNN's Jim Sciutto. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I firmly believe the Russia angle is fake news. But this gives me pause,\" the person said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Senior Justice Department and FBI officials said they were unaware of the Comey decision until the announcement. Officials who spoke to CNN said they were shocked by the development. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Comey's term was due to run until 2023. The decade-long tenure was introduced to shield FBI directors from being drawn into politics, but the position is still subject to dismissal at the pleasure of the President. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Comey's last appearance on Capitol Hill last week exacerbated doubts about his position. Just before news of his dismissal broke, his office issued a statement aiming to clear up his testimony that former Clinton aide Huma Abedin \"forwarded hundreds and thousands\" of emails to her husband's laptop. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The note, signed by Gregory Brower, assistant director of the FBI's Office of Congressional Affairs, clarified that the \"hundreds and thousands of emails\" that Comey said were 'forwarded\" from Abedin to her husband's email \"included emails transferred via backups as well as manual forwarding.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The White House said it would immediately launch the search for a new FBI director. Deputy Director Andrew McCabe is now the acting FBI director, according to a message sent to employees by Sessions. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Comey was appointed FBI director by President Barack Obama in 2013. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In so doing, he elevated a Republican law enforcement veteran who had been critical of the Justice Department under former President George W. Bush to the top domestic investigative and surveillance organization, among the most powerful posts in the world. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the decades since former FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, the controversial director who brought the FBI into the modern era, law enforcement has avoided the appearance of influencing politics the way Hoover did. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But Comey's decision to thrust himself repeatedly into the 2016 election put him at odds with the FBI's general decision to stay away from the political spotlight. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Comey made the decision in July to go public with his recommendation that the Justice Department not pursue any charges against Clinton or her former staffers over her email practices as secretary of state. However, he also took the opportunity to rebuke Clinton at length as being \"extremely careless\" with sensitive information. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Then-candidate Trump had talked up the investigation until this point, at which time he and his campaign derided Comey for the \"political\" decision. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Just days away from the election, Comey jumped into the race again. He informed Congress, via letter, that the FBI had reopened its investigation into Clinton. The decision was made because of its investigation into former Rep. Anthony Weiner, who is married to Clinton confidant Huma Abedin. Comey followed up days later with another letter, informing Congress that the FBI didn't find anything and continued to believe Clinton's practices did not merit the pursuance of any criminal charges. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After Clinton's loss, former President Bill Clinton blamed Comey for it, as have many Clinton staffers, at least in part. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Last week, Hillary Clinton herself told CNN's Christiane Amanpour: \"I was on the way to winning until a combination of Jim Comey's letter on October 28 and Russian WikiLeaks raised doubts in the minds of people who were inclined to vote for me and got scared off.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After taking office, Trump met with Comey at the White House. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He offered a cryptic remark to the FBI chief. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Oh, here's Jim,\" Trump said in January. \"He's become more famous than me.\"\nPassage 3:\nCalls to appoint an independent prosecutor have simmered for months, but until now, they had been voiced almost entirely by Democrats.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The White House has not said what precipitated the firing, a significant question because the Justice Department\u2019s stated reasons were well known even when Mr. Trump decided in January to keep Mr. Comey on the job. Mr. Trump watched last week as Mr. Comey testified on Capitol Hill, offering his first public explanation of his handling of the Clinton email case. There, Mr. Comey said that he had no regrets about his decisions but that he felt \u201cmildly nauseous\u201d that his actions might have tipped the election to Mr. Trump. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Clinton controversy centers on a news conference Mr. Comey held last July, when he broke with longstanding tradition and policies by publicly discussing the Clinton case and chastising Mrs. Clinton\u2019s \u201ccareless\u201d handling of classified information. Then, in the campaign\u2019s final days, Mr. Comey announced that the F.B.I. was reopening the investigation, a move that earned him widespread criticism.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR What was not thought through, apparently, was an explanation of why Comey was fired now, at a time when critics would immediately conclude it was because of the Russia probe. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In recent days, Comey again came under fire for his handling of the investigation into Clinton's private email server. Many Democrats believe that his announcement that he was reopening the probe 11 days before the election cost the former secretary of state the presidency. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump referred to Democrats' criticism of Comey Wednesday morning, tweeting, \"The Democrats have said some of the worst things about James Comey, including the fact that he should be fired, but now they play so sad!\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Democrats have said some of the worst things about James Comey, including the fact that he should be fired, but now they play so sad! \u2014 Donald J.

The source said he made a joke about it to lighten the mood and called his office to get confirmation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Longtime Trump ally Roger Stone was among those who recommended to the President that he fire Comey, according to a source familiar with the conversation. Stone, who also is being scrutinized by the FBI as part of its Russia investigation, spoke to Trump after Comey appeared at a hearing last week on Capitol Hill, according to the source. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump immediately disputed that Stone was involved: \"The Roger Stone report on @CNN is false - Fake News.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But multiple White House officials said Trump had been considering firing Comey for at least a week before he made Tuesday's decision. Indeed, Trump revealed his anger in a string of late-night messages on Twitter May 2, exactly a week before his final decision was made public. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At the center of Rosenstein's rationale for recommending Comey's firing was the director's handling of the investigation into Clinton's private server, namely his decision to recommend no charges be filed and the news conference he held to explain his reasoning.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Compounding the error, the director ignored another longstanding principle: We do not hold press conferences to release derogatory information about the subject of a declined criminal investigation,\" Rosenstein argued in his memo. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We should reject the departure and return to the traditions (of the bureau),\" Rosenstein said. \"The way the director handled the conclusion of the email investigation was wrong. As a result, the FBI is unlikely to regain public and congressional trust until it has a director who understands the gravity of the mistakes and pledges never to repeat them.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Congressional reaction NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said he told Trump on the telephone that he had made a terrible mistake.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I am troubled by the timing and reasoning of Director Comey's termination. I have found Director Comey to be a public servant of the highest order, and his dismissal further confuses an already difficult investigation by the Committee,\" Burr said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As Democrats renewed their demands for a special counsel, arguing that the Trump Justice Department could not be trusted to oversee the case, Republicans insisted that one was not needed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I think Rod Rosenstein, the new deputy attorney general, is competent to lead that effort,\" said Texas Sen. John Cornyn, a member of the GOP leadership. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But Republican Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker of Tennessee said that though Rosenstein's rationale for removing Comey was sound, it, would \"raise questions.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sen. John McCain added: \"While the President has the legal authority to remove the director of the FBI, I am disappointed in the President's decision to remove James Comey from office.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Arizona senator renewed his request for a special congressional committee to review the Russia allegations. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'Absurd' NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR CNN's senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin was not buying the idea that Comey was sacked over the Clinton investigation, saying it was \"absurd.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Toobin branded the move a \"grotesque abuse of power by the President of the United States.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"This is not something that is within the American political tradition,\" Toobin said, comparing the sacking of Comey to President Richard Nixon's firing of special prosecutor Archibald Cox during the Watergate scandal. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"This is not normal. This is not politics as usual,\" said Toobin, though he added that Trump did have the legal authority to fire an FBI director. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The White House, however, said that the impetus for the firing of Comey came from Rosenstein, noting that he was a career prosecutor who served under President Barack Obama as the US Attorney for Maryland, and was confirmed in his new job on April 25. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A senior administration official said that Rosenstein assessed the situation upon taking office and concluded the FBI director had lost his confidence. He sent his recommendation to Sessions -- who has recused himself from the Russia investigation since he was a Trump adviser and campaign surrogate -- who forwarded it to Trump, who accepted it on Tuesday.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I was as frustrated, concerned and disappointed as anyone with Director Comey's handling of the email investigation, but President Trump just fired the man investigating how Russia meddled in our election and whether members of his campaign were involved, an investigation President Trump called a \"charade\" only 24 hours ago,\" said Clinton's former campaign manager, Robby Mook. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It's equally concerning that our attorney general, who lied about his own meetings with the Russians, approved Director Comey's firing,\" he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR One Trump loyalist, who worked on the campaign and the transition, gave his reaction to CNN's Jim Sciutto. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I firmly believe the Russia angle is fake news. But this gives me pause,\" the person said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Senior Justice Department and FBI officials said they were unaware of the Comey decision until the announcement. Officials who spoke to CNN said they were shocked by the development. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Comey's term was due to run until 2023. The decade-long tenure was introduced to shield FBI directors from being drawn into politics, but the position is still subject to dismissal at the pleasure of the President. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Comey's last appearance on Capitol Hill last week exacerbated doubts about his position. Just before news of his dismissal broke, his office issued a statement aiming to clear up his testimony that former Clinton aide Huma Abedin \"forwarded hundreds and thousands\" of emails to her husband's laptop. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The note, signed by Gregory Brower, assistant director of the FBI's Office of Congressional Affairs, clarified that the \"hundreds and thousands of emails\" that Comey said were 'forwarded\" from Abedin to her husband's email \"included emails transferred via backups as well as manual forwarding.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The White House said it would immediately launch the search for a new FBI director. Deputy Director Andrew McCabe is now the acting FBI director, according to a message sent to employees by Sessions. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Comey was appointed FBI director by President Barack Obama in 2013. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In so doing, he elevated a Republican law enforcement veteran who had been critical of the Justice Department under former President George W. Bush to the top domestic investigative and surveillance organization, among the most powerful posts in the world. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the decades since former FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, the controversial director who brought the FBI into the modern era, law enforcement has avoided the appearance of influencing politics the way Hoover did. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But Comey's decision to thrust himself repeatedly into the 2016 election put him at odds with the FBI's general decision to stay away from the political spotlight. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Comey made the decision in July to go public with his recommendation that the Justice Department not pursue any charges against Clinton or her former staffers over her email practices as secretary of state. However, he also took the opportunity to rebuke Clinton at length as being \"extremely careless\" with sensitive information. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Then-candidate Trump had talked up the investigation until this point, at which time he and his campaign derided Comey for the \"political\" decision. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Just days away from the election, Comey jumped into the race again. He informed Congress, via letter, that the FBI had reopened its investigation into Clinton. The decision was made because of its investigation into former Rep. Anthony Weiner, who is married to Clinton confidant Huma Abedin. Comey followed up days later with another letter, informing Congress that the FBI didn't find anything and continued to believe Clinton's practices did not merit the pursuance of any criminal charges. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After Clinton's loss, former President Bill Clinton blamed Comey for it, as have many Clinton staffers, at least in part. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Last week, Hillary Clinton herself told CNN's Christiane Amanpour: \"I was on the way to winning until a combination of Jim Comey's letter on October 28 and Russian WikiLeaks raised doubts in the minds of people who were inclined to vote for me and got scared off.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After taking office, Trump met with Comey at the White House. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He offered a cryptic remark to the FBI chief. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Oh, here's Jim,\" Trump said in January. \"He's become more famous than me.\"\nPassage 3:\nCalls to appoint an independent prosecutor have simmered for months, but until now, they had been voiced almost entirely by Democrats.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The White House has not said what precipitated the firing, a significant question because the Justice Department\u2019s stated reasons were well known even when Mr. Trump decided in January to keep Mr. Comey on the job. Mr. Trump watched last week as Mr. Comey testified on Capitol Hill, offering his first public explanation of his handling of the Clinton email case. There, Mr. Comey said that he had no regrets about his decisions but that he felt \u201cmildly nauseous\u201d that his actions might have tipped the election to Mr. Trump. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Clinton controversy centers on a news conference Mr. Comey held last July, when he broke with longstanding tradition and policies by publicly discussing the Clinton case and chastising Mrs. Clinton\u2019s \u201ccareless\u201d handling of classified information. Then, in the campaign\u2019s final days, Mr. Comey announced that the F.B.I. was reopening the investigation, a move that earned him widespread criticism.

Payroll taxes increase for many employers across USA NORFOLK, Va. \u0097 Last year was the worst Don Miller had seen in more than 20 years of running a graphic printing business here. Business slumped 15%, and he had to lay off two of the three workers who helped him print stickers and signs for Navy ships. Miller hopes to bring them back, but hiring will be more expensive for all Virginia business owners this year. The recession has emptied Virginia's unemployment insurance trust fund, and the state is making up for it by raising taxes on employers and cutting jobless benefits for seniors. In 2009, the average business owner paid $95 per employee. This year, the tax will be $171, according to estimates by the state workforce agency. \"It's another added expense to hiring somebody,\" Miller says. \"Everything's going up, and business is going down.\" Similar tax increases are hitting employers nationwide this year as states struggle to pay the 5.5 million Americans currently collecting state jobless benefits. So far, high unemployment and, in many cases, poor planning have prompted 25 states to borrow more than $25 billion from the federal government to keep benefit checks in the mail. In other states, unemployment compensation funds are still in the black, but reserves are rapidly dwindling. Nine more states likely will be borrowing by mid-year, according to a ProPublica analysis of state revenue and benefits. Tax on businesses Business owners in 36 states face tax increases ranging from a few dollars to nearly $1,000 per worker. Six states are scaling back or freezing benefits for the unemployed: \u2022 Jobless Pennsylvania workers will get 2.3% less in benefits starting this month, while the average tax this year for businesses will increase to $432 from $384 per worker. \u2022 Hawaii's employers face an average increase to $1,070 from $90 per worker. The state also proposes decreasing the maximum benefit by as much as a third \u2014 about $190 per week. \u2022 Texas, where the trust fund is $1.4 billion in the red, has increased the average tax on employers to about $165 from $89 per worker. Instead of fulfilling the unemployment insurance system's purpose of stimulating the economy, these measures may contribute to joblessness, says Gary Burtless, an economist who studies labor policy at the Brookings Institution, a think tank. \"We don't want to pick this moment of all moments to boost taxes on employers,\" Burtless says. \"We want to encourage employers as much as possible to add to their payrolls.\" Workers are being hurt in another way \u2014 through benefit cuts. In Roanoke, Va., James Hay, 70, received a letter from the state informing him that his monthly unemploymentbenefits are being cut to $100 from about $800 because state law limits payments to Social Security recipients when the state's fund runs low. \"I was devastated when I read it,\" Hay says. \"I thought, 'Lord, what am I going to buy heating oil with this winter?' \" Like many other seniors, Hay was working full time to supplement his $1,400 monthly Social Security check, which he says was not enough to support him, his granddaughter and her two young children. Then the asphalt factory laid him off. Unemployment insurance made up for some of the lost income, but now Hay is not sure how his family will get by. \"We'll just have to do whatever we can do,\" he says. \"I hope and pray we'll be all right.\" States borrow heavily The state hopes to save about $11 million through the cuts to seniors but anticipates borrowing $1.3 billion to replenish its unemployment fund before the recession ends. \"The middle of a recession is when people need help most,\" says Maurice Emsellem, policy co-director of the National Employment Law Project, an advocacy group for low-wage workers. Cutting unemployment benefits, he says, \"undermines the fundamental goals of the program \u2014 boosting the economy and keeping people out of poverty in an economic downturn.\" Many states such as Virginia are already at or near the highest payroll tax rates allowed by law, and others have pushed politically difficult tax increases through their legislatures, making further benefit cuts likely if high unemployment persists, says Rich Hobbie, executive director of the National Association of State Workforce Agencies. Some of the pain might have been avoidable. Long before the recession began, Virginia and many other states that have imposed tax increases or benefit cuts let their trust funds dwindle well below the 18 months of reserves the U.S. Labor Department recommends. Virginia had to slow down federal borrowing despite the impact on businesses and seniors, says Republican state Sen. John Watkins, chairman of the Virginia Commission for the Unemployment Insurance Trust Fund. \"I have angst for people who are unemployed,\" he says. \"But our trust fund is busted \u2014 it's gone.\" Pierce reports for ProPublica, an independent, non-profit newsroom based in New York.

In Roanoke, Va., James Hay, 70, received a letter from the state informing him that his monthly unemploymentbenefits are being cut to $100 from about $800 because state law limits payments to Social Security recipients when the state's fund runs low. \"I was devastated when I read it,\" Hay says. \"I thought, 'Lord, what am I going to buy heating oil with this winter?' \" Like many other seniors, Hay was working full time to supplement his $1,400 monthly Social Security check, which he says was not enough to support him, his granddaughter and her two young children. Then the asphalt factory laid him off. Unemployment insurance made up for some of the lost income, but now Hay is not sure how his family will get by. \"We'll just have to do whatever we can do,\" he says. \"I hope and pray we'll be all right.\" States borrow heavily The state hopes to save about $11 million through the cuts to seniors but anticipates borrowing $1.3 billion to replenish its unemployment fund before the recession ends. \"The middle of a recession is when people need help most,\" says Maurice Emsellem, policy co-director of the National Employment Law Project, an advocacy group for low-wage workers. Cutting unemployment benefits, he says, \"undermines the fundamental goals of the program \u2014 boosting the economy and keeping people out of poverty in an economic downturn.\" Many states such as Virginia are already at or near the highest payroll tax rates allowed by law, and others have pushed politically difficult tax increases through their legislatures, making further benefit cuts likely if high unemployment persists, says Rich Hobbie, executive director of the National Association of State Workforce Agencies. Some of the pain might have been avoidable. Long before the recession began, Virginia and many other states that have imposed tax increases or benefit cuts let their trust funds dwindle well below the 18 months of reserves the U.S. Labor Department recommends. Virginia had to slow down federal borrowing despite the impact on businesses and seniors, says Republican state Sen. John Watkins, chairman of the Virginia Commission for the Unemployment Insurance Trust Fund. \"I have angst for people who are unemployed,\" he says. \"But our trust fund is busted \u2014 it's gone.\" Pierce reports for ProPublica, an independent, non-profit newsroom based in New York.

He is accused of pressuring state and municipal officials to take official action on government matters. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Acting U.S. Attorney William Weinreb said Joyce, who as a state senator represented more than 100,000 constituents across Milton, Randolph, Avon, Canton, Stoughton, West Bridgewater and parts of Braintree, East Bridgewater and Sharon, ran his public office as a \u201ccriminal enterprise.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cHe had a duty to serve (his constituents) honestly, and he violated that duty by accepting bribes and kickbacks in exchange for his official action,\u201d Weinreb said.

Months later, Joyce reportedly sold his Milton home and also sold his family burial plot in Milton, where he grew up. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Joyce is accused of participating in a number of complex schemes dating back to 2010 that netted him hundreds of thousands of dollars and concealing the payments by using his law office as a \u201cmoney laundering conduit.\u201d Prosecutors say he also lied to the state\u2019s ethics commission and used the panel as a \u201ccloak of legitimacy for his corrupt schemes.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In one case, prosecutors alleged Joyce used his position to exert influence on behalf of a New York-based energy brokerage business and formed a shell company to collect secret kickbacks from the firm.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The indictment also accuses Joyce of taking legislative action to aid a Dunkin Donuts franchise whose owner was paying him tens of thousands of dollars for \u201cpurported legal fees\u201d and providing him with hundreds of pounds of free coffee.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Joyce is also charged with conspiring to defraud the IRS in connection with his purchase of more than $470,000 in common stock from the energy brokerage firm and falsely reporting the stock purchase as a tax-exempt retirement account rollover in his personal tax return.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Governor Charlie Baker told the Globe that the charges against Joyce should be a warning to anyone in public office. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cPeople in public life need to respect the offices they hold, and that means not using them for personal gain,\u2019\u2019 he said Friday. \u201cAnd, if the feds believe there is enough there to justify an indictment, then the investigation needs to be thorough and move forward accordingly.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Acting Senate President Harriette Chandler issued a brief statement: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cLaw enforcement has done its job today. This case now moves to the courts, and I am confident that the justice system will come to a fair and just conclusion in the days to come.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Joyce had been an early supporter of then Senate President Stanley Rosenberg, who appointed him assistant majority leader in 2015 and made him chairman of the committee that decided which bills would come up for a vote. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Now, Joyce is facing more than 100 criminal charges, outpacing the corruption counts leveled against other politicians in recent years, including former House speaker Sal DiMasi and former state senator Dianne Wilkerson, who was charged with one count of bribery. DiMasi was sentenced to eight years after he was convicted of helping a software company win multimillion-dollar state contracts in exchange for kickbacks. Wilkerson was sentenced to three and a half years. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If convicted on all counts, Joyce could face far more jail time. Some of the counts in the indictment carry possible sentences of up to 20 years each. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But Joyce\u2019s attorney Cooper suggested that the charges against his client are the work of overzealous federal prosecutors. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cI should add that, in the last few years, it has been very apparent across the country that the federal government has brought a number of cases against public officials, which have either gone nowhere, or have been rejected by juries, or have been highly criticized by the courts,\u201d Cooper said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The charges against Joyce represent a stunning fall from grace over the past two years. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Joyce, 55, decided not to run for reelection in 2016 \u2014 and moved out of Milton, his longtime hometown \u2014 after the FBI and IRS raided his Canton law office. The raid followed a series of stories published by the Globe describing some of the ways in which he appeared to use his public position to get private benefits for himself and his family. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Joyce aroused suspicions by repeatedly receiving discounted and sometimes free goods and services, often from businesses in his legislative district. For instance, when he was angling for a Senate leadership position in late 2014, he gave his Senate colleagues expensive sunglasses that he got at a significant discount from a company in his district, as well as pounds of Dunkin\u2019 Donuts coffee. Joyce also received free dry cleaning from a Randolph dry cleaner for more than a decade, services worth thousands of dollars. Neither the sunglasses nor the dry cleaning were mentioned in the indictment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Through his attorney, Joyce denied any wrongdoing. He said he bartered the dry cleaning for legal work and paid for coffee and sunglasses the same price as anyone else. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Globe also wrote extensively about Joyce\u2019s relationship with Energi, the Peabody company that is the subject of much of the indictment. The company, which sells insurance to the energy industry, hired Joyce and his law firm to do legal work and to handle regulatory matters before the state Division of Insurance. Between 2010 and 2015, the company paid the Joyce Law Group $377,169 in fees, according to the indictment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Even so, Joyce apparently wanted more legal business and fees in return for his help with a bill promoted by the company. He filed the bill and spoke at a symposium sponsored by Energi promoting the bill \u2014 never disclosing his ties to the company. Energi put him on retainer, paying him $5,000 a month for approximately five months. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cWe intend to cooperate fully with the government . . . and we regret that we too were victimized by Mr. Joyce,\u201d said Brian Kelly, a lawyer who represents Energi. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The indictment also describes Joyce\u2019s relationship with a company that sells solar credits, Power Management, referred to in the indictment as the \u201cenergy broker.\u201d The company paid him \u201csecret kickbacks\u201d for his help in landing the company energy consulting work with the towns of Randolph, Easton, East Bridgewater, Southbridge, and Holbrook, the indictment said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He created a shell company, \u201cWindswept LLC,\u201d where he deposited the kickbacks, the indictment says. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In Milton, where he lived until this year, he allegedly approached developer John Morrill about buying and redeveloping the Milton Women\u2019s Club, a historic building that had fallen into disrepair, the indictment says. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Joyce pressured the planning board to allow Morrill to take actions that would allow Morrill to build four houses on the site. In return, the indictment says, Morrill agreed to pay Joyce a kickback \u2014 a 2014 Jeep from one of his dealerships. Morrill also agreed that Joyce\u2019s wife, Mary, a local realtor, would be a sales broker for the homes built on the site. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Joyce was also accused of using his position to try to extract a $25,000 fee from a Philadelphia-based solar company, Tecta Solar. The company was looking for help with legislation and permitting for a project in West Bridgewater. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cYeah, I can get the permit for you,\u201d Joyce told Tecta officials. \u201cIt would be through my law firm, and our fee would be $25,000 . . .\u2019 according to the indictment.

Brian Joyce \u201cviolated the public\u2019s trust\u201d and \u201cdecided to take the path of greed\u201d by using his office for personal profit to accept up to $1 million in bribes and kickbacks in exchange for official actions, federal investigators said Friday.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Federal authorities arrested Joyce, 55, at his Westport home on Friday. Joyce pleaded not guilty to the charges before a federal magistrate in Worcester Friday afternoon. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The 113-count indictment against Joyce, stemming from a two-year investigation, includes charges of racketeering, extortion, wire fraud, conspiracy to defraud the IRS and money laundering. His lawyer, Howard Cooper, said in an email to The Associated Press that he is still reviewing the charges. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR READ: THE FULL INDICTMENT AGAINST BRIAN JOYCE NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The indictment alleges that Joyce secretly profited from his position as state senator by accepting \u201ca stream of concealed bribes and kickbacks\u201d that included a free Jeep and hundreds of pounds of Dunkin Donuts coffee, in exchange for official actions before the state Legislature. He is accused of pressuring state and municipal officials to take official action on government matters. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Acting U.S. Attorney William Weinreb said Joyce, who as a state senator represented more than 100,000 constituents across Milton, Randolph, Avon, Canton, Stoughton, West Bridgewater and parts of Braintree, East Bridgewater and Sharon, ran his public office as a \u201ccriminal enterprise.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cHe had a duty to serve (his constituents) honestly, and he violated that duty by accepting bribes and kickbacks in exchange for his official action,\u201d Weinreb said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In February 2016, the FBI and IRS raided Joyce\u2019s Canton law office. Months later, Joyce reportedly sold his Milton home and also sold his family burial plot in Milton, where he grew up. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Joyce is accused of participating in a number of complex schemes dating back to 2010 that netted him hundreds of thousands of dollars and concealing the payments by using his law office as a \u201cmoney laundering conduit.\u201d Prosecutors say he also lied to the state\u2019s ethics commission and used the panel as a \u201ccloak of legitimacy for his corrupt schemes.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In one case, prosecutors alleged Joyce used his position to exert influence on behalf of a New York-based energy brokerage business and formed a shell company to collect secret kickbacks from the firm. In another scheme, prosecutors say Joyce pressured the Milton Planning Board to approve a waiver sought by a developer, who gave Joyce a Jeep from one of the developer\u2019s car dealerships. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The indictment also accuses Joyce of taking legislative action to aid a Dunkin Donuts franchise whose owner was paying him tens of thousands of dollars for \u201cpurported legal fees\u201d and providing him with hundreds of pounds of free coffee. Investigators allege Joyce took steps to conceal this by submitting backdated checks to the State Ethics Commission and instructed the franchise owner and his relative to falsely represent to the Ethics Commission that they had agreed to provide Joyce coffee in exchange for legal services. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The indictment also alleges that Joyce attempted to use his Senate position to collect money for \u201clegal work\u201d from representatives of a Philadelphia solar company who sought Joyce\u2019s assistance with local permitting and pending legislation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Joyce is also charged with conspiring to defraud the IRS in connection with his purchase of more than $470,000 in common stock from the energy brokerage firm and falsely reporting the stock purchase as a tax-exempt retirement account rollover in his personal tax return. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Weinreb would not say whether charges would be brought against any of the companies accused to be involved in the schemes but said the investigation remains ongoing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Joyce, who had served as assistant majority leader, announced last year that he would not seek re-election in 2017. He had represented his district since 1998. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A 1980 graduate of Milton High School, Joyce received a bachelor\u2019s degree from Boston College School of Management and a law degree from Suffolk University Law School. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As a state legislator, Joyce served as chairman of the Special Senate Committee on Government Expenditures and the Vice Chair of the Senate Committee on Redistricting. He was also a member of the Joint Committee on Telecommunications, Utilities and Energy as well as the Joint Committee on Health Care Financing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In 2015, then-Senate President Stan Rosenberg asked the ethics commission to review Joyce\u2019s conduct after The Boston Globe reported on potential conflicts of interest focusing on whether he used his position to boost his law practice. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In an unrelated case last year, Joyce agreed to pay nearly $5,000 to resolve issues raised by state campaign finance regulators, including using campaign funds for his son\u2019s 2014 high school graduation party. Joyce said there had been no finding of wrongdoing on his part in that case. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The arrest is the second blow to the state Senate in the past week. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Rosenberg announced Monday he was stepping aside as president of the chamber during a Senate Ethics Committee investigation into the circumstances surrounding reported sexual misconduct allegations by several men against his husband, Bryon Hefner. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Harriette Chandler, a Worcester Democrat who is serving as acting Senate president, said in a statement about Joyce that she\u2019s confident the \u201cjustice system will come to a fair and just conclusion in the days to come.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Republican Gov. Charlie Baker called the allegations against Joyce disturbing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cPeople in public life need to respect the offices they hold and that means not using them for personal gain, and if the feds believe there\u2019s enough there to justify an indictment then the investigation needs to be thorough and move forward accordingly,\u201d Baker said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Last year, after federal authorities raided Joyce\u2019s law office in Canton, Baker poked fun at then-Sen. Joyce at the annual St. Patrick\u2019s Day Breakfast in Boston.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Joyce, once the Senate\u2019s assistant majority leader, was taken from his Westport home in handcuffs early on Friday morning and escorted by federal agents to be booked and fingerprinted, and face federal charges of mail fraud, corruption, money laundering, and embezzlement, among many others.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Standing before US Magistrate Judge David Hennessy, Joyce pleaded not guilty to all the charges before he was released on $250,000 secured bond.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The 113-count indictment describes Joyce as someone who considered his duties as an elected public official secondary to his goal of secretly amassing wealth, a goal he would achieve by using the power of his Senate office to help those who allegedly provided bribes and kickbacks to him. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cDefendant Joyce\u2019s objective in conducting and participating in the affairs of the Senate Office . . . was to secretly profit from his position as State Senator [by] . . . accepting a stream of concealed bribes and kickbacks from private individuals and entities in exchange for his official action as specific opportunities arose,\u2019\u2019 the indictment reads. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Joyce is accused of using his law office, the Joyce Law Group in Canton, \u201cas a money laundering conduit for the corrupt payments\u201d by labeling the bribes and kickbacks as legal referral fees and consulting fees for working on real estate issues, and by using the \u201ccorrupt payments\u201d to buy a 2014 Jeep, according to the indictment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR David L. Ryan/Globe Staff US Attorney William D. Weinreb addressed the media about the Joyce indictment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A developer seeking help with Milton town officials is accused of handing over the Jeep to Joyce without demanding he pay the $20,000 due on the purchase price, authorities allege. The developer, John Morrill, who owns two car dealerships, has been a longtime political supporter of Joyce. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Advertisement NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Under one scheme, federal authorities allege, Joyce spent $471,250 to purchase 65,000 shares in a company, Energi, whose business activities he was actively supporting on Beacon Hill. But Joyce never disclosed his financial ties to the company and falsely claimed the money he used to buy the stock came from a tax-free rollover of an IRA account. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cDefendant Joyce created sham retirement accounts for himself and his spouse in order to conceal his stock ownership from the Ethics Commission and to defraud the IRS,\u2019\u2019 the indictment alleges.

On one occasion in 2015, he collected 504 pounds of coffee, worth an estimated $4,278, for free, authorities allege.

Miller Hits: 1763 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Facing fixed-mount solar panels west instead of south could produce more electricity during peak demand according to a new study from Pecan Street Research, which debunks the conventional wisdom that solar panels should always face south when installed on homes in the northern hemisphere. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The research firm, based at the University of Texas's Austin campus, concentrates on testing and developing new technology and business models in advanced energy management systems. The company tested 50 Austin homes with solar panels, some with south-facing installations. Pecan Street used a financial incentive to convince others to install west-facing solar panels for the sake of the study, which is the first of its kind. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While advanced modeling and research used by installers suggest homeowners could lose up to 30 percent of their energy production by facing solar panels west instead of south, the Pecan Street study found otherwise. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Austin homes with west-facing solar panels produced 2 percent more electricity during the course of a normal day than homeowners with south-facing panels. Beyond that, they produced 49 percent more electricity during peak demand hours of 3 to 7pm. Homeowners with south-facing solar panels reduced their peak energy usage by 54 percent, while those with west-facing panels cut their power draws by 65 percent. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cThere\u2019s no other residential demand response tool generating 60 percent reductions,\u201d Brewster McCracken, CEO of Pecan Street, told Green Tech Media. \u201cThose are pretty extraordinary peak reductions.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This research has the potential to dramatically change the residential solar market. While homeowners with east-west roof pitches have historically thought they would not be good candidates for solar, it turns out their west-facing roof could be an even better spot for solar than their neighbor\u2019s south-facing roof. It essentially opens the solar market up to every homeowner who doesn\u2019t have significant shading issues. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It also means homeowners might be more inclined to install west-facing solar panels - even if they do have a south-facing roof -especially if their utility offers pricing differentiation between peak demand hours and off-peak hours. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It's important to note, however, that the Austin study was conducted during the summer months. It\u2019s hard to predict what the overall outcome of the same study would be if winter months, when the sun sets shortly after electricity demand spikes, were included. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Comments:\nPassage 2:\nConventional wisdom says that if you put solar panels on your roof in the Northern Hemisphere, you should point them within 30 degrees of true south to generate the most energy in the course of a year.

(See related quiz: What You Don\u2019t Know About Solar Power.\u201d) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Though the study has not been released publicly, Pecan Street provided a copy to National Geographic News. It analyzed 50 homes in the Austin area, looking not just at the amount of electricity generated by the panels, but at the impact on homeowners\u2019 electricity use and the utility grid during periods of summer peak electrical demand, which generally occur between 3 p.m. and 7 p.m. (See related post: \u201cSolar Researchers Dig Deeper Into Snow Issue.\u201d) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The study found that west-facing solar systems reduced the amount of electricity that homeowners needed to draw from the grid during summer peak demand by 65 percent. Homes with the conventional true-south orientation, in comparison, achieved a 54 percent reduction. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Pecan Street chief executive and study co-author Brewster McCracken explained that west-oriented panels may be more effective for many homeowners because of their lifestyles. West-oriented panels are more effective at capturing solar energy late in the afternoon, which also happens to be the time that most people get home from work and turn on their air conditioning in the summer, he said. So homeowners with panels facing in that direction are optimizing their solar power generation at precisely the time that their own usage surges, and when the utility company needs the most help coping with demand. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Additionally, McCracken said, using a west orientation for panels means that less electricity will go unused by the homeowners who generated it, and end up as surplus electricity being put back into the grid. That makes things easier for utility companies. \u201cThey\u2019re not structured to handle high levels of electricity being sent back to the grid,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they have to do that, it becomes a challenge to maintain electric reliability in an area.\u201d (See related story: \u201cNew \u2018Flexible\u2019 Power Plants Sway to Keep Up With Renewables.\u201d) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While solar panel installers have known that west-facing panels may be more effective for a while, utility companies still cling to the south-is-best rule-of-thumb, and refuse to give rebates to homeowners unless their panels are facing south, McCracken said.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Pecan Street study isn\u2019t the first to show that west-facing panels may be more effective.

Authorities are working to determine what exactly happened to Forrest and Donna Sanco while en route to Rum Cay on September 26, one day after the pair flew their private aircraft from Houston, Texas; through Florida and then Freeport, Grand Bahama where the couple reportedly cleared customs and spent the night. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Bahamas Air and Sea Rescue Association (BASRA) Operations Manager Chris Lloyd on Tuesday confirmed that Mr Sanco officially closed his flight plan at 4:58pm on September 26, signalling to air traffic controllers that he was nearing his destination.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"My biggest concern is the time and the fact we didn't really know he was missing until too much time had passed,\" Fox says. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR We now know weather that day called for afternoon storms and repairs had been done to the plane during the trip. We're told Donna and Forrest originally took off from a small airfield in Cresson, southwest of Fort Worth. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The plane they were flying, a Cessna 150, had recently been purchased by Forrest.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Search and rescue documents obtained by The Tribune yesterday indicate debris and a life raft spotted on the eastern side of Cat Island is now \u201cnot believed\u201d to be associated with the Sanco investigation. Authorities are working to determine what exactly happened to Forrest and Donna Sanco while en route to Rum Cay on September 26, one day after the pair flew their private aircraft from Houston, Texas; through Florida and then Freeport, Grand Bahama where the couple reportedly cleared customs and spent the night. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Bahamas Air and Sea Rescue Association (BASRA) Operations Manager Chris Lloyd on Tuesday confirmed that Mr Sanco officially closed his flight plan at 4:58pm on September 26, signalling to air traffic controllers that he was nearing his destination. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR However, according to his family members and caretakers in Rum Cay, the pair never arrived. The Sanco couple were renting a holiday home from Pat and Earl Lambert. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR No reports were made about the missing couple until Friday, October 6 \u2013 roughly 10 days after the couple was originally scheduled to turn up. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Tribune understands it was at this time reports of the missing couple were disseminated to the United States Coast Guard and the Royal Bahamas Defence Force (RBDF). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR United States Coast Guard has stressed the RBDF is leading all efforts on the matter. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Forrest Sanco\u2019s niece, 23-year-old LeeAnn Burger initially tried to raise $10,000 through a Go Fund Me campaign to hire private crews and pilots to find the couple. That target was passed in just a few days and has so far brought in more than $12,000. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On the gofundme site last night LeeAnn said: \u201c Due to lack of resources with the Bahamian government and coast guard we have been forced to hire our own private search crews and pilots. This has been costly and could continue to be as we need to search until we find something. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cEverything we raise will go to our efforts to bring them home whatever it takes! Whether it be continuing to hire private crews, medical expenses, or costs involved in trying to get them back home to us. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cIf there are any funds left over at the conclusion the funds will be split between a fund for Forrest\u2019s daughter Riley and a donation to the Maritime Search and Rescue fund in the hopes no other family will have to bear this burden.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Meanwhile the search for the Sancos continues.\nPassage 3:\nA Texas couple who took their private plane to go on a trip of a lifetime in the Bahamas \u2014 where they also planned to elope \u2014 have now been missing for over two weeks. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Sept. 26, Forrest Sanco and Donna Grant of Fort Worth, Texas, took off from Fort Pierce, Florida, and landed in Freeport, Bahamas, but they never made it to their final destination in Rum Cay, where they had rented a house and planned to tie the knot. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The couple, both 56, who went to high school together, reconnected a year ago on Facebook and instantly knew they were meant to be. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cThey had a whirlwind romance,\u201d Sanco\u2019s neice, Lee-Ann Burger, 23, tells PEOPLE. \u201cHe told us that he knew she was the one after their first date.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cIn true Sanco fashion,\u201d says Burger, he bought a Cessna 150, reinstated his pilot\u2019s license and planned the trip. Because the trip was going to be a romantic adventure for the couple, their families didn\u2019t expect to hear from them often, which is why they didn\u2019t expect anything was wrong until a week had gone by and they hadn\u2019t heard from them. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cMy husband got a call from Forrest\u2019s friend asking if he had heard from him,\u201d Burger says. \u201cHe was watching his cat and he hadn\u2019t come to pick him up.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It was then that they called Sanco\u2019s employer who said he was supposed to return to work days ago. They knew something must be wrong, Burger recalls, but it was only when they found out that Sanco hadn\u2019t talked to his 10-year-old daughter in several days that they began to panic. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR His ex-wife, which whom he shares joint custody, told Burger that they assumed his silence was just because he was enjoying his vacation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Forrest Sanco and Donna Grant LeeAnn Burger NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cI immediately went on social media and found a Facebook page for the Rum Cay community,\u201d says Burger. \u201cA guy named Craig responded and said it was his house they were renting but they never showed up.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Craig, who also has a plane, discussed Sanco\u2019s flight plan with him \u2014 which gave the family clues as to where they could be. Their last known location was in Freeport, Bahamas, and Sanco\u2019s last post to Instagram was on Sept. 26. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cWe found out they cleared customs in Freeport on the 26th and we were able to find fuel receipts in North Eleuthera,\u201d she says, \u201cbut after that, we can\u2019t track them anywhere.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cWe were able to find a couple local guys with airplanes who have basically been conducting searches for us,\u201d says Burger, who says that due to lack of resources with the Bahamian government and coast guard, the family has had to hire their own private search crews and pilots. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Reports of the missing couple were disseminated to the United States Coast Guard and the Royal Bahamas Defence Force (RBDF), according to Burger. United States Coast Guard has stressed the RBDF is leading all efforts on the matter, according to the Bahamas Tribune. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cWe have been faced with nothing but resistance. It\u2019s beyond frustrating,\u201d Burger says. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The family has created a GoFundMe page to help with the steep costs. Although every lead has resulted in a dead end, they\u2019re determined to continue the search. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cWe\u2019re trying to remain hopeful, but we\u2019re also realistic,\u201d says Burger. \u201cI think at this point we\u2019re searching for answers.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Photograph courtesy NASA/JPL-Caltech/MSSS NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NASA's Curiosity rover, which has been on Mars for almost a year and a half now, just delivered its largest and most important downlink so far of findings, discoveries, and conclusions. (Also see video: \"Mission to Mars.\") NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While the six papers released by the journal Science report on different aspects of Mars and do it from different scientific perspectives, together they present the beginnings of a new understanding of the red planet, especially in its early epochs, three to four billion years ago. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Early Mars, it has become increasingly apparent, was in many important ways similar to Earth. (See also \"Did Life on Earth Come From Mars?\") NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"If you put together all that we're learning about Gale Crater and Mars, you really begin to chip away the rock and the sculpture inside emerges,\" said Pan Conrad, an astrobiologist with NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center and a co-author on several of the papers. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As described in the six Science papers, that hidden but slowly materializing landscape looks something like this: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 1. Early Mars was habitable, perhaps for a long time. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After concluding that rivers and streams once flowed into Gale Crater, the Curiosity team has now reported that a lake existed there as well. That surface water, as well as groundwater that likely went down hundreds of meters, possessed all that was needed to support microbial life. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The period when Gale Crater was warmer, wetter, and habitable was broadly between 3.5 and 4 billion or more years ago. That period is when life on Earth is understood to have arisen. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Was Mars once home to primitive extraterrestrial life? Curiosity can't and won't make that determination, but its discoveries have made the possibility of Martian life significantly more plausible. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 2. Water once flowed on many parts of Mars. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And that water was there at times and in forms that scientists didn't believe to be possible not long ago. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR One of the major achievements of Curiosity so far has been to \"ground-truth\" observations made in recent years by the satellites orbiting the planet. Those instruments found strong hints that Mars had a watery past, and at Gale Crater they were found to be on target. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As a result, the mission has given greater credibility to the view that thousands of additional fossil formations of what appear to be ancient streams, channels, deltas, and lakes likely are just what they appeared to be. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 3. \"Follow the carbon\" has been vindicated. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The search for Martian carbon-based organic compounds\u2014one of the major goals of the Curiosity mission\u2014has been and will continue to be complicated and trying. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While as many as six different organic compounds have been identified so far by the miniature chemistry lab called Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM), their origin remain unclear. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"There's no doubt that SAM has identified organics, but we can't say with confidence yet that they are Martian in origin,\" said Douglas Ming of NASA's Johnson Space Center, and author of one of the six Curiosity papers in Science. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There are at least two sources of the confounding results: The presence on Mars of a chlorine-based compound that, when heated in the SAM oven with any organic material, largely destroys the compounds. And the leak into the SAM ovens of an organic solvent brought to Mars as part of a wet chemistry experiment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The search for Martian organics is nonetheless making progress. With each collection of Martian sand or rock, the number of organics found and their concentration has increased\u2014suggesting that different samples of Martian material are leading to different results. If the organics were all contaminants from Earth, those concentrations would likely be more steady. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"SAM is probably the most complex and important instrument ever brought to another planet,\" Ming said. \"Inevitably, it has taken time to figure out how best to work with it.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 4. Mars gets pounded by radiation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Galactic cosmic rays and solar eruptions bombard Mars, and their high-energy particles break the bonds that allow organisms to survive. The Radiation Assessment Detector on Curiosity has made the first measurements ever of radiation on the surface of Mars, and the results are sobering. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In another Science paper, RAD principal investigator Donald Hassler reports that the radiation would almost certainly be fatal within a few million years to any microbial life on the surface or less than several meters deep. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The RAD team used as their model the terrestrial bacteria Deinococcus radiodurans, which is capable of withstanding enormous doses of radiation, to make that assessment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Notwithstanding the high levels of radiation, Hassler reported that life could theoretically still survive on Mars today under special circumstances. If a bacteria similar to D. radiodurans appeared when early Mars was wetter, warmer, and had a more protective atmosphere, he wrote, it could have survived over the epochs through long periods of dormancy. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 5. Mars radiation also damages normal chemistry. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Many on the Curiosity team point to radiation damage of all carbon chemistry on Mars as a major reason why it has been so difficult to identify organics on the surface. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That effort, however, may have gotten a significant boost from one of the most unexpected developments to come out of the mission so far\u2015a method to date how long surfaces have been exposed to the sky on Mars. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Using measurements of radioactive decay also employed on Earth, Kenneth Farley of the California Institute of Technology reports that the surface of Yellowknife Bay has been exposed for some 80 million years. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The discovery points to a method for finding places for the rover to drill where there has been less chemistry-damaging radiation exposure. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Essentially, Farley said, the team has to look for cliffs or overhangs being undercut by the surface wind\u2015as happened in Yellowknife Bay\u2015and where radiation would be blocked by the rocks above. \"If we find that kind of formation,\" he said, \"drill there.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 6. Detours sometimes turn out to be interesting. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Curiosity rover was scheduled to head for the scientifically alluring Mount Sharp in the center of Gale Crater soon after landing. More than 480 days into the mission, the rover is still months away from its prime destination. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The detour to Yellowknife Bay is the main reason why, and it has turned out to be a gold mine of data. But now the rover is on what is called the \"rapid transit route\" to three-mile-high Mount Sharp, driving most of the time and passing many potentially interesting sites.\nPassage 2:\nMastcam mosaic of the Yellowknife Bay formation. This is a view from the base of an exposed section up through Sheepbed, Gillespie Lake, and basal Glenelg members. Locations of drill holes and Alpha Particle X-Ray Spectrometer (A PXS) measurements are shown. Image released Dec. 9, 2013. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NASA's Curiosity rover has found evidence of an ancient Martian lake that could have supported life as we know it for long stretches \u2014 perhaps millions of years. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This long and skinny freshwater lake likely existed about 3.7 billion years ago, researchers said, suggesting that habitable environments were present on Mars more recently than previously thought. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Quite honestly, it just looks very Earth-like,\" said Curiosity lead scientist John Grotzinger, of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena. [Ancient Mars Could Have Supported Life (Photos)] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"You've got an alluvial fan, which is being fed by streams that originate in mountains, that accumulates a body of water,\" Grotzinger told SPACE.com. \"That probably was not unlike what happened during the last glacial maximum in the Western U.S.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The lake once covered a small portion of the 96-mile-wide (154 kilometers) Gale Crater, which the 1-ton Curiosity rover has been exploring since touching down on the Red Planet in August 2012. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Yes - The Red Planet is teeming with tiny microbes, we just haven't found them yet. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Yes - An advanced civilization lives below the surface, where we can't detect them. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR No - Life never existed on Mars. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR No - Mars once had life, but those organisms are long dead. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The main task of Curiosity's $2.5 billion mission is to determine whether Gale Crater could ever have supported microbial life. The rover team achieved that goal months ago, announcing in March that a spot near Curiosity's landing site called Yellowknife Bay was indeed habitable billions of years ago NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The new results, which are reported today (Dec. 9) in six separate papers in the journal Science, confirm and extend Curiosity's landmark discovery, painting a more complete picture of the Yellowknife Bay area long ago. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This picture emerged from Curiosity's analysis of fine-grained sedimentary rocks called mudstones, which generally form in calm, still water. The rover obtained powdered samples of these rocks by drilling into Yellowknife Bay outcrops. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The mudstones contain clay minerals that formed in the sediments of an ancient freshwater lake, researchers said. Curiosity also spotted some of the key chemical ingredients for life in the samples, including sulfur, nitrogen, hydrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and carbon. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The lake could have potentially supported a class of microbes called chemolithoautotrophs, which obtain energy by breaking down rocks and minerals. Here on Earth, chemolithoautotrophs are commonly found in habitats beyond the reach of sunlight, such as caves and hydrothermal vents on the ocean floor. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It is exciting to think that billions of years ago, ancient microbial life may have existed in the lake's calm waters, converting a rich array of elements into energy,\" Sanjeev Gupta of Imperial College London, co-author of one of the new papers, said in a statement. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NASA's Curiosity rover \u2014 the centerpiece of NASA's $2.5 billion Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) mission \u2014 landed on Mars Aug. 5.

How much do you know about Curiosity and its mission? 0 of questions complete NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The shallow ancient lake may have been about 30 miles long by 3 miles wide (50 by 5 kilometers), Grotzinger said. Based on the thickness of the sedimentary deposits, the research team estimates that the lake existed for at least tens of thousands of years \u2014 and perhaps much longer, albeit on a possibly on-and-off basis. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Taking into account the broader geological context, \"you could wind up with an assemblage of rocks that represent streams, lakes and ancient groundwater systems \u2014 so for times when the lake might have been dry, the groundwater's still there. This could have gone on for millions or tens of millions of years,\" Grotzinger said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The lack of weathering on Gale Crater's rim suggests that the area was cold when the lake existed, he added, raising the possibility that a layer of ice covered the lake on a permanent or occasional basis. But such conditions wouldn't be much of a deterrent to hardy microbes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"These are entirely viable habitable environments for chemolithoautotrophs,\" Grotzinger said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Researchers still don't know if the Gale Crater lake hosted organisms of any kind; Curiosity was not designed to hunt for signs of life on Mars. But if chemolithoautotrophs did indeed dominate the lake, it would put an alien twist on a superficially familiar environment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"You can imagine that, if life evolved on Mars and never got beyond the point of chemolithoautotrophy, then in the absence of competition from other types of microbes, these systems might have been dominated by that type of metabolic pathway,\" Grotzinger said. \"And that's an un-Earth-like situation.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Follow Mike Wall on Twitter @michaeldwall and Google+.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The main task of Curiosity's $2.5 billion mission is to determine whether Gale Crater could ever have supported microbial life. The rover team achieved that goal months ago, announcing in March that a spot near Curiosity's landing site called Yellowknife Bay was indeed habitable billions of years ago NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The new results, which are reported today (Dec. 9) in six separate papers in the journal Science, confirm and extend Curiosity's landmark discovery, painting a more complete picture of the Yellowknife Bay area long ago. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This picture emerged from Curiosity's analysis of fine-grained sedimentary rocks called mudstones, which generally form in calm, still water. The rover obtained powdered samples of these rocks by drilling into Yellowknife Bay outcrops. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The mudstones contain clay minerals that formed in the sediments of an ancient freshwater lake, researchers said. Curiosity also spotted some of the key chemical ingredients for life in the samples, including sulfur, nitrogen, hydrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and carbon. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The lake could have potentially supported a class of microbes called chemolithoautotrophs, which obtain energy by breaking down rocks and minerals. Here on Earth, chemolithoautotrophs are commonly found in habitats beyond the reach of sunlight, such as caves and hydrothermal vents on the ocean floor. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It is exciting to think that billions of years ago, ancient microbial life may have existed in the lake's calm waters, converting a rich array of elements into energy,\" Sanjeev Gupta of Imperial College London, co-author of one of the new papers, said in a statement.

Based on the thickness of the sedimentary deposits, the research team estimates that the lake existed for at least tens of thousands of years \u2014 and perhaps much longer, albeit on a possibly on-and-off basis. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Taking into account the broader geological context, \"you could wind up with an assemblage of rocks that represent streams, lakes and ancient groundwater systems \u2014 so for times when the lake might have been dry, the groundwater's still there. This could have gone on for millions or tens of millions of years,\" Grotzinger said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The lack of weathering on Gale Crater's rim suggests that the area was cold when the lake existed, he added, raising the possibility that a layer of ice covered the lake on a permanent or occasional basis. But such conditions wouldn't be much of a deterrent to hardy microbes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"These are entirely viable habitable environments for chemolithoautotrophs,\" Grotzinger said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Researchers still don't know if the Gale Crater lake hosted organisms of any kind; Curiosity was not designed to hunt for signs of life on Mars. But if chemolithoautotrophs did indeed dominate the lake, it would put an alien twist on a superficially familiar environment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"You can imagine that, if life evolved on Mars and never got beyond the point of chemolithoautotrophy, then in the absence of competition from other types of microbes, these systems might have been dominated by that type of metabolic pathway,\" Grotzinger said. \"And that's an un-Earth-like situation.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Follow Mike Wall on Twitter @michaeldwall and Google+.

Write a one-page summary of all news. \n\nNews:\nPassage 1:\nTORONTO (AP) \u2014 The new premier of Ontario is the brother of late Toronto Mayor Rob Ford, who became famous for smoking crack cocaine. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Doug Ford's Progressive Conservatives have won the provincial election in Canada's most populous province. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Doug Ford is a populist who has been compared to U.S. President Donald Trump. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Rob's Ford's tenure as mayor of the country's largest city was marred by revelations about his illegal drug use. Rob Ford died of cancer in 2016. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A Liberal defeat Thursday was predicted by outgoing Liberal Premier Kathleen Wynne herself just days before the vote. The party had been in power for 15 years. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Doug Ford's election promises include income tax cuts and he strongly opposes a carbon tax.\nPassage 2:\nHe may be polarizing to a significant segment of voters, have run a messy campaign and come with his own political baggage, but Progressive Conservative Leader Doug Ford may just have been the \"ideal candidate\" to win this Ontario election. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This assessment comes not from a conservative political partisan, but from Don Guy, veteran Liberal political campaign strategist, former campaign director and former chief of staff to Liberal ex-premier Dalton McGuinty. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I think he was the ideal candidate because he gave small-c conservative voters a very comfortable home, a very comfortable archetype and a very strong message,\" he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Certainly Ford benefited significantly from a voting public looking for change \u2014 tired of the Liberals and their unpopular leader Kathleen Wynne, who was never able to completely distance herself from the scandal-plagued McGuinty years or convince voters she represented a clean start for the party. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ford, as well, was able to capitalize on Ontario voters who may have had no love for him, but remained somewhat skeptical of the NDP. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But Ford's majority win was also a vindication for his team against the naysayers, including some in his own party, who believed his rise to the leadership doomed their chances. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the end, his controversial years by the side of his brother Rob Ford during his reign as mayor, scandals over party nominations, last-minute headlines about legal disputes with his brother's widow \u2014 none of it had enough impact to curb his path to victory. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'He came across as sensible' NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I think the fact that he came across as sensible during the debates really helped him a lot,\" said Kathy Brock, a political scientist at Queen's University in Kingston, Ont. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"He didn't get upset during them. It was a very controlled campaign. He was very much in control as well.

He stayed on point. He repeated them.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ford's control, says Brock, also served to counter the image his opponents tried to create, that he was a radical, hard-right conservative and Donald Trump clone. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR None of Trump's xenophobia NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While there may be similarities with Trump in terms of populist appeal, Ford, like his brother, had made significant inroads into various ethnic communities in Toronto, and his campaign has none of the xenophobia attached to the U.S. president's, said Brock. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And like his brother, Doug Ford portrayed himself as a tax-cutting warrior, a fiscal conservative who believes governments waste too much taxpayers' money. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That message, says Guy, was simple and repeated over and over \u2014 a Ford government will be a responsible steward for taxpayers' money, \"and that help is on the way for hard-working families.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ford said he would cut taxes, cut the price of gas, cut hydro rates, cut the price of beer and eliminate the deficit while spending billions on transit and infrastructure projects. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Supporters react in Toronto on Thursday night after learning Doug Ford had won a majority government. (Mark Blinch/Canadian Press) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"He had a simple product, and he was selling it at a lower price than anybody else in terms of tax cuts and other commitments of reduced prices, whether it was for gas and beer etc.,\" said Ryerson University political science professor Myer Siemiatycki.

It wasn't until the end of May that his campaign put out a costed platform, with the exception of an important detail. While putting a price tag on those and other promises, they neglected to include how any of them would be paid for. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Finding 'efficiencies' NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Yet Ford's go-to explanation, simply that he would find \"efficiencies\" in government, may have resonated with voters. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"People do see government as being wasteful in some ways. Everybody's got a story about that. So that kind of hits home,\" said Brock. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Premier Kathleen Wynne tells supporters Thursday night that she is resigning as Liberal leader. (Christopher Katsarov/Canadian Press) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ford's strategists employed a front-runners campaign, minimizing the opportunities for him to make mistakes, which included little access for the media. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Indeed, the imprecision of the policy platform was designed to keep the different coalitions within that party together and the different voting coalitions together without getting pinned down on anything that's too specific, said Cristine de Clercy, a political science professor at Western University in London, Ont. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Imprecision doesn't hurt NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Clearly that that didn't substantially hurt them, it was a viable decision,\" said de Clercy. \"If you think you're going to win, why basically give your opponents the opportunity to attack your plan?\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ford's campaign, put together relatively last minute following the sudden departure of former leader Patrick Brown, was by normal standards, disorganized and slow, not at all what one would expect from the party, said Jonathan Malloy, chair of the political science department at Carleton University. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On the campaign trail, Ford got out to greet supporters, including these ones in Ottawa. (Justin Tang/Canadian Press) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"And you know that sort of chaos is consistent with the leader's brand. I mean, Mr. Ford doesn't pretend to be \u2026 a smooth organized individual, and the campaign platform reflected that.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Chaotic, maybe, but ultimately simple and effective, said Guy. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'The magic of it' NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"That was the magic of it. The simplicity of the message, simplicity of the strategy, everybody could understand it.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The winning strategy, Guy says, was simply to take the angry rural conservative base that's been building over the last four elections and add the established voting pool made up of Ford Nation, that core group of supporters in Toronto who were faithful to former mayor Rob Ford and were the key to his one-term rule. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Some believed Christine Elliott may have been a stronger, safer candidate who appealed to other voters and demographics not enamoured of Ford. But Guy said the strategy the party implemented would not have been readily available to her, meaning no one can say whether Elliott would have made an even better showing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"They would have had to invent a whole new wheel.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Despite Ford's victory, Siemiatycki noted the strong showing of the NDP and the seats won in different pockets of Ontario. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"This was not a Ford landslide romp to victory,\" he said. \"Among all the Ontarians who voted in this election, the majority did not support Mr. Ford. So it's not like there is this massive groundswell of attachment to Mr. Ford.\"\nPassage 3:\nThe province of Ontario is now a Ford nation.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Wynne\u2019s party, in power since her predecessor Dalton McGuinty defeated the Tories in 2003, was reduced to a tiny rump, falling short of the eight seats required for official status in the legislature. Ontario\u2019s first female premier, who succeeded McGuinty in February 2013, took the unusual step of conceding defeat last Saturday in a desperate attempt to salvage Liberal seats. \u201cThis is a difficult night,\u201d said Wynne, 65, who is stepping down as Liberal leader. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ontario PC leader Doug Ford reacts after winning the Ontario Provincial election to become the new premier in Toronto, on Thursday, June 7, 2018 ( CARLOS OSORIO / TORONTO STAR ) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cThere is another generation and I am passing the torch to that generation,\u201d she said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Still, there are few to grasp it \u2014 numerous members of Wynne\u2019s cabinet were defeated, including Finance Minister Charles Sousa. Surviving ministers Michael Coteau, Marie-France Lalonde, and Nathalie Des Rosiers are mentioned as potential future leaders. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Article Continued Below NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR One prominent Liberal casualty was Jim Bradley, St. Catharines MPP since 1977. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Green Party Leader Mike Schreiner, who turns 49 on Saturday, made history, though, becoming his party\u2019s first MPP by winning in Guelph. \u201cI\u2019m ready to take my seat at Queen\u2019s Park,\u201d said Schreiner. In some ways, Ford is an accidental premier. Until Brown\u2019s departure, he planned on a rematch this October against Toronto Mayor John Tory, who beat him municipally in 2014. But the most eventful provincial campaign in decades was upended Jan. 24 when CTV News aired a report alleging sexual impropriety against Brown involving two women. While he denied the allegations \u2014 and is now suing CTV, which stands by its story, for $8 million \u2014 he was forced to resign early on Jan. 25. That triggered an expedited Tory leadership race that Christine Elliott, who had finished second to Brown in 2015 and third in the 2009 contest, was expected to win. Even though Elliott received the most votes and won more ridings at the party\u2019s chaotic March 10 convention, Ford narrowly edged her in the party\u2019s convoluted \u201cpoints\u201d tally. It was a stunning rebuke of the party elites by an outsider that Brown\u2019s Tories had not even wanted as a local candidate.

Opinion | Ontario has given Doug Ford carte blanche to do virtually anything he wants Dynasties come and go in Canadian politics NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ontario PC leader Doug Ford wins a majority government. His staunch supporters praise him as a political outsider sure to shake things up at Queen's Park. (The Canadian Press) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR They felt his reputation at Toronto city hall, where he was a key figure in the tumultuous mayoralty of his controversial late brother, Rob Ford, would undermine the modern, inclusive party they were building. At the PC policy convention last November, the one-term Toronto councillor was a solitary figure hovering alone at the back of the hall during the then leader\u2019s speech. But since taking the reins, he has brought Elliott into the fold along with another former leadership rival, Caroline Mulroney, the daughter of former prime minister Brian Mulroney. Both women will sit at Ford\u2019s cabinet table. Also expected to be ministers are the newly elected Rod Phillips and Peter Bethlenfalvy and MPPs Vic Fedeli, Lisa MacLeod, Steve Clark, and John Yakabuski. Having what was seen as a deep potential ministerial bench was critical to Ford\u2019s success. After Horwath narrowed the gap in public opinion polls following his shaky performance in the three leaders\u2019 debates last month, he scrambled to showcase his team, which he maintained was \u201cready to govern\u201d in contrast to the NDP. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Many New Democratic candidates, he insisted, were \u201cradical downtown Toronto elites,\u201d who should not be given the keys to Queen\u2019s Park. However, voters may have handed Ford a blank cheque. He has promised to cut spending by $6 billion and vowed to do it painlessly without slashing even one public-sector job. \u201cNot one,\u201d he repeatedly said without specifying where he would find such massive \u201cefficiencies.\u201d His platform, never fully costed despite promises it would be, consisted of a series of populist planks like a 10 cents a litre reduction in gasoline taxes, lowering the floor price of beer to $1, selling beer and wine in convenience stores, and reducing personal and corporate taxes. On the campaign trail, his handlers limited media exposure and the freewheeling Ford from Toronto city hall was recast as a carefully scripted politician behind a teleprompter. Still, he weathered a bevy of problems, including revelations he attended a political fundraiser in April even though that\u2019s against the new campaign finance law, that he appeared to have flouted PC rules to sell memberships for candidate Kinga Surma, and that one of his former candidates was linked to the alleged data breach at the 407 ETR that compromised the personal information of 60,000 motorists. As well, Rob Ford\u2019s widow filed a $16.5 million lawsuit Friday alleging Doug Ford and older brother, Randy Ford, had cheated her and her children out of her late husband\u2019s inheritance. Doug Ford denied Renata Ford\u2019s allegations, which have not been proven in court. Yet none of these potential landmines hurt the first victorious Tory campaign since Mike Harris was re-elected in 1999. For Wynne, defeat appeared to have been preordained with Liberal insiders pointing to 2015 as the year when the wheels began to fall off. That was the year of the Sudbury byelection debacle that saw Wynne\u2019s deputy chief of staff charged with bribery and then exonerated in 2017. It was also when the premier decided to sell the majority share in Hydro One, the provincial transmission utility, using the proceeds to bankroll transportation infrastructure. Both Ford and Horwath successfully conflated the partial privatization with rising electricity bills even though that is a separate issue. Ford has even promised to fire Mayo Schmidt, the highly paid Hydro One CEO he derided as \u201cthe six million dollar man.\u201d And in 2015, Wynne injected herself into the federal election campaign, helping Justin Trudeau defeat Stephen Harper to become prime minister, but appearing in the public\u2019s eyes as just another partisan politician. \u201cOur (poll) numbers started to decline then and we never recovered,\u201d confided one senior Liberal, speaking on condition of anonymity in order to discuss internal strategy. While Wynne returned to her social-justice roots, raising the minimum wage to $14 an hour from $11.60 \u2014 and promised to make it $15 next year, a raise Ford has said he will cancel \u2014 as well as introducing free prescription drug coverage for everyone under 25, it was not enough to save the Liberals.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Doug Ford's Progressive Conservatives have won the provincial election in Canada's most populous province. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Doug Ford is a populist who has been compared to U.S. President Donald Trump. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Rob's Ford's tenure as mayor of the country's largest city was marred by revelations about his illegal drug use. Rob Ford died of cancer in 2016. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A Liberal defeat Thursday was predicted by outgoing Liberal Premier Kathleen Wynne herself just days before the vote. The party had been in power for 15 years. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Doug Ford's election promises include income tax cuts and he strongly opposes a carbon tax.\nPassage 2:\nHe may be polarizing to a significant segment of voters, have run a messy campaign and come with his own political baggage, but Progressive Conservative Leader Doug Ford may just have been the \"ideal candidate\" to win this Ontario election. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This assessment comes not from a conservative political partisan, but from Don Guy, veteran Liberal political campaign strategist, former campaign director and former chief of staff to Liberal ex-premier Dalton McGuinty. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I think he was the ideal candidate because he gave small-c conservative voters a very comfortable home, a very comfortable archetype and a very strong message,\" he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Certainly Ford benefited significantly from a voting public looking for change \u2014 tired of the Liberals and their unpopular leader Kathleen Wynne, who was never able to completely distance herself from the scandal-plagued McGuinty years or convince voters she represented a clean start for the party. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ford, as well, was able to capitalize on Ontario voters who may have had no love for him, but remained somewhat skeptical of the NDP. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But Ford's majority win was also a vindication for his team against the naysayers, including some in his own party, who believed his rise to the leadership doomed their chances. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the end, his controversial years by the side of his brother Rob Ford during his reign as mayor, scandals over party nominations, last-minute headlines about legal disputes with his brother's widow \u2014 none of it had enough impact to curb his path to victory. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'He came across as sensible' NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I think the fact that he came across as sensible during the debates really helped him a lot,\" said Kathy Brock, a political scientist at Queen's University in Kingston, Ont. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"He didn't get upset during them. It was a very controlled campaign. He was very much in control as well.

He stayed on point. He repeated them.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ford's control, says Brock, also served to counter the image his opponents tried to create, that he was a radical, hard-right conservative and Donald Trump clone. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR None of Trump's xenophobia NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While there may be similarities with Trump in terms of populist appeal, Ford, like his brother, had made significant inroads into various ethnic communities in Toronto, and his campaign has none of the xenophobia attached to the U.S. president's, said Brock. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And like his brother, Doug Ford portrayed himself as a tax-cutting warrior, a fiscal conservative who believes governments waste too much taxpayers' money. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That message, says Guy, was simple and repeated over and over \u2014 a Ford government will be a responsible steward for taxpayers' money, \"and that help is on the way for hard-working families.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ford said he would cut taxes, cut the price of gas, cut hydro rates, cut the price of beer and eliminate the deficit while spending billions on transit and infrastructure projects. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Supporters react in Toronto on Thursday night after learning Doug Ford had won a majority government. (Mark Blinch/Canadian Press) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"He had a simple product, and he was selling it at a lower price than anybody else in terms of tax cuts and other commitments of reduced prices, whether it was for gas and beer etc.,\" said Ryerson University political science professor Myer Siemiatycki.

It wasn't until the end of May that his campaign put out a costed platform, with the exception of an important detail. While putting a price tag on those and other promises, they neglected to include how any of them would be paid for. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Finding 'efficiencies' NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Yet Ford's go-to explanation, simply that he would find \"efficiencies\" in government, may have resonated with voters. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"People do see government as being wasteful in some ways. Everybody's got a story about that. So that kind of hits home,\" said Brock. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Premier Kathleen Wynne tells supporters Thursday night that she is resigning as Liberal leader. (Christopher Katsarov/Canadian Press) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ford's strategists employed a front-runners campaign, minimizing the opportunities for him to make mistakes, which included little access for the media. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Indeed, the imprecision of the policy platform was designed to keep the different coalitions within that party together and the different voting coalitions together without getting pinned down on anything that's too specific, said Cristine de Clercy, a political science professor at Western University in London, Ont. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Imprecision doesn't hurt NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Clearly that that didn't substantially hurt them, it was a viable decision,\" said de Clercy. \"If you think you're going to win, why basically give your opponents the opportunity to attack your plan?\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ford's campaign, put together relatively last minute following the sudden departure of former leader Patrick Brown, was by normal standards, disorganized and slow, not at all what one would expect from the party, said Jonathan Malloy, chair of the political science department at Carleton University. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On the campaign trail, Ford got out to greet supporters, including these ones in Ottawa. (Justin Tang/Canadian Press) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"And you know that sort of chaos is consistent with the leader's brand. I mean, Mr. Ford doesn't pretend to be \u2026 a smooth organized individual, and the campaign platform reflected that.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Chaotic, maybe, but ultimately simple and effective, said Guy. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'The magic of it' NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"That was the magic of it. The simplicity of the message, simplicity of the strategy, everybody could understand it.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The winning strategy, Guy says, was simply to take the angry rural conservative base that's been building over the last four elections and add the established voting pool made up of Ford Nation, that core group of supporters in Toronto who were faithful to former mayor Rob Ford and were the key to his one-term rule. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Some believed Christine Elliott may have been a stronger, safer candidate who appealed to other voters and demographics not enamoured of Ford. But Guy said the strategy the party implemented would not have been readily available to her, meaning no one can say whether Elliott would have made an even better showing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"They would have had to invent a whole new wheel.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Despite Ford's victory, Siemiatycki noted the strong showing of the NDP and the seats won in different pockets of Ontario. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"This was not a Ford landslide romp to victory,\" he said. \"Among all the Ontarians who voted in this election, the majority did not support Mr. Ford. So it's not like there is this massive groundswell of attachment to Mr. Ford.\"\nPassage 3:\nThe province of Ontario is now a Ford nation. Progressive Conservative Leader Doug Ford capped an improbable rise to power Thursday, winning the Ontario election with a majority government and banishing Kathleen Wynne\u2019s Liberals into political oblivion after almost 15 years in office. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Doug Ford's Ontario Progressive Conservatives will form a majority government following Thursday\u2019s provincial election. The premier-elect says he will continue the legacy of his late brother Rob, a former Toronto mayor. (The Canadian Press) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cThis is incredible. My friends, this victory belongs to you. Tonight the people of Ontario have spoken. You have come together around one common vision of Ontario,\u201d Ford, 53, told cheering supporters in Etobicoke. \u201cWe will work every single day for a better Ontario,\u201d said the rookie leader, who only took the helm on March 10 after the resignation of Patrick Brown. NDP Leader Andrea Horwath will be the leader of the official opposition in a radically changed legislature that will feature dozens of new Tory, New Democratic, and Green MPPs. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Article Continued Below NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cFrom the very start of this campaign, people wanted change and I could not be more proud that we offered a positive vision. Change for the better,\u201d Horwath, 55, told loyalists in Hamilton. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Wynne\u2019s party, in power since her predecessor Dalton McGuinty defeated the Tories in 2003, was reduced to a tiny rump, falling short of the eight seats required for official status in the legislature. Ontario\u2019s first female premier, who succeeded McGuinty in February 2013, took the unusual step of conceding defeat last Saturday in a desperate attempt to salvage Liberal seats. \u201cThis is a difficult night,\u201d said Wynne, 65, who is stepping down as Liberal leader. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ontario PC leader Doug Ford reacts after winning the Ontario Provincial election to become the new premier in Toronto, on Thursday, June 7, 2018 ( CARLOS OSORIO / TORONTO STAR ) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cThere is another generation and I am passing the torch to that generation,\u201d she said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Still, there are few to grasp it \u2014 numerous members of Wynne\u2019s cabinet were defeated, including Finance Minister Charles Sousa. Surviving ministers Michael Coteau, Marie-France Lalonde, and Nathalie Des Rosiers are mentioned as potential future leaders. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Article Continued Below NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR One prominent Liberal casualty was Jim Bradley, St. Catharines MPP since 1977. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Green Party Leader Mike Schreiner, who turns 49 on Saturday, made history, though, becoming his party\u2019s first MPP by winning in Guelph. \u201cI\u2019m ready to take my seat at Queen\u2019s Park,\u201d said Schreiner. In some ways, Ford is an accidental premier. Until Brown\u2019s departure, he planned on a rematch this October against Toronto Mayor John Tory, who beat him municipally in 2014. But the most eventful provincial campaign in decades was upended Jan. 24 when CTV News aired a report alleging sexual impropriety against Brown involving two women. While he denied the allegations \u2014 and is now suing CTV, which stands by its story, for $8 million \u2014 he was forced to resign early on Jan. 25. That triggered an expedited Tory leadership race that Christine Elliott, who had finished second to Brown in 2015 and third in the 2009 contest, was expected to win. Even though Elliott received the most votes and won more ridings at the party\u2019s chaotic March 10 convention, Ford narrowly edged her in the party\u2019s convoluted \u201cpoints\u201d tally. It was a stunning rebuke of the party elites by an outsider that Brown\u2019s Tories had not even wanted as a local candidate.

Opinion | Ontario has given Doug Ford carte blanche to do virtually anything he wants Dynasties come and go in Canadian politics NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ontario PC leader Doug Ford wins a majority government. His staunch supporters praise him as a political outsider sure to shake things up at Queen's Park. (The Canadian Press) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR They felt his reputation at Toronto city hall, where he was a key figure in the tumultuous mayoralty of his controversial late brother, Rob Ford, would undermine the modern, inclusive party they were building. At the PC policy convention last November, the one-term Toronto councillor was a solitary figure hovering alone at the back of the hall during the then leader\u2019s speech. But since taking the reins, he has brought Elliott into the fold along with another former leadership rival, Caroline Mulroney, the daughter of former prime minister Brian Mulroney. Both women will sit at Ford\u2019s cabinet table. Also expected to be ministers are the newly elected Rod Phillips and Peter Bethlenfalvy and MPPs Vic Fedeli, Lisa MacLeod, Steve Clark, and John Yakabuski. Having what was seen as a deep potential ministerial bench was critical to Ford\u2019s success. After Horwath narrowed the gap in public opinion polls following his shaky performance in the three leaders\u2019 debates last month, he scrambled to showcase his team, which he maintained was \u201cready to govern\u201d in contrast to the NDP. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Many New Democratic candidates, he insisted, were \u201cradical downtown Toronto elites,\u201d who should not be given the keys to Queen\u2019s Park. However, voters may have handed Ford a blank cheque. He has promised to cut spending by $6 billion and vowed to do it painlessly without slashing even one public-sector job. \u201cNot one,\u201d he repeatedly said without specifying where he would find such massive \u201cefficiencies.\u201d His platform, never fully costed despite promises it would be, consisted of a series of populist planks like a 10 cents a litre reduction in gasoline taxes, lowering the floor price of beer to $1, selling beer and wine in convenience stores, and reducing personal and corporate taxes. On the campaign trail, his handlers limited media exposure and the freewheeling Ford from Toronto city hall was recast as a carefully scripted politician behind a teleprompter. Still, he weathered a bevy of problems, including revelations he attended a political fundraiser in April even though that\u2019s against the new campaign finance law, that he appeared to have flouted PC rules to sell memberships for candidate Kinga Surma, and that one of his former candidates was linked to the alleged data breach at the 407 ETR that compromised the personal information of 60,000 motorists. As well, Rob Ford\u2019s widow filed a $16.5 million lawsuit Friday alleging Doug Ford and older brother, Randy Ford, had cheated her and her children out of her late husband\u2019s inheritance. Doug Ford denied Renata Ford\u2019s allegations, which have not been proven in court. Yet none of these potential landmines hurt the first victorious Tory campaign since Mike Harris was re-elected in 1999. For Wynne, defeat appeared to have been preordained with Liberal insiders pointing to 2015 as the year when the wheels began to fall off. That was the year of the Sudbury byelection debacle that saw Wynne\u2019s deputy chief of staff charged with bribery and then exonerated in 2017. It was also when the premier decided to sell the majority share in Hydro One, the provincial transmission utility, using the proceeds to bankroll transportation infrastructure.

His teeth, back and front, were also heavily worn from chewing coarse grain and use as a \"third hand\" for gripping tools and cutting.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Earlier computer scans had revealed \u00d6tzi's severe arteriosclerosis, or hardening of the arteries. But the new analysis shows that \u00d6tzi had a genetic predisposition to the condition, despite the fact that as a hunter-gatherer he had none of what are currently believed to be the relevant risk factors, such as being overweight, getting too little exercise, and smoking or drinking. \"This new data suggests that we might be less able to prevent arteriosclerosis than we believed,\" notes cardiologist and mummy expert Gregory Thomas of the University of California, Irvine, who was not involved in the new work. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The whole genome sequencing also reveals more about \u00d6tzi's ancestors. Earlier research analyzed \u00d6tzi's mitochondrial DNA, which is inherited through only the female line, but had found few known matches among modern populations. Now sequencing of his Y chromosome places him in the rare G2A4 haplogroup, meaning that his paternal genes are linked to a population that left the Near East for Europe at the beginning of the Neolithic era, roughly 1000 years before \u00d6tzi himself lived. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u00d6tzi's genetic profile marks him as being most closely related to small populations currently living in the islands of Sardinia and Corsica, as well as some of the more remote areas of Georgia and Russia, says geneticist Angela Graefen of the Institute for Mummies and the Iceman in Bolzano, Italy, one of the principal researchers on the paper.

{"prompt": "You are given several news passages. Write a one-page summary of all news. \n\nNews:\nPassage 1:\nMorley Safer CBS News NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Morley Safer, the CBS newsman who changed war reporting forever when he showed U.S. Marines burning the huts of Vietnamese villagers and went on to become the iconic 60 Minutes correspondent whose stylish stories on America's most-watched news program made him one of television's most enduring stars, died today in Manhattan. He was 84. He had homes in Manhattan and Chester, Conn. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Safer was in declining health when he announced his retirement last week; CBS News broadcast a long-planned special hour to honor the occasion on Sunday May 15 that he watched in his home. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A huge presence on 60 Minutes for 46 years -- Safer enjoyed the longest run anyone ever had on primetime network television. Though he cut back a decade ago, he still appeared regularly until recently, captivating audiences with his signature stories on art, science and culture. A dashing figure in his checked shirt, polka dot tie and pocket square, Morley Safer -- even his name had panache -- was in his true element playing pool with Jackie Gleason, delivering one of his elegant essays aboard the Orient Express or riffing on Anna Wintour, but he also asked the tough questions and did the big stories. In 2011, over 18.5 million people watched him ask Ruth Madoff how she could not have known her husband Bernard was running a billion-dollar Ponzi scheme. The interview was headline news and water cooler talk for days. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"This is a very sad day for all of us at 60 Minutes and CBS News. Morley was a fixture, one of our pillars, and an inspiration in many ways.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In some of his later 60 Minutes pieces, Safer profiled the cartoonists of The New Yorker, interviewed the founder and staff of Wikipedia and reported on a billion-dollar art trove discovered in a Munich apartment. In his last story broadcast on March 13, he profiled the visionary architect Bjarke Ingels. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Morley was one of the most important journalists in any medium, ever,\" said CBS Chairman and CEO, Leslie Moonves. \"He broke ground in war reporting and made a name that will forever be synonymous with 60 Minutes. He was also a gentleman, a scholar, a great raconteur - all of those things and much more to generations of colleagues, his legion of friends, and his family, to whom all of us at CBS offer our sincerest condolences over the loss of one of CBS' and journalism's greatest treasures.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"This is a very sad day for all of us at 60 Minutes and CBS News. Morley was a fixture, one of our pillars, and an inspiration in many ways. He was a master storyteller, a gentleman and a wonderful friend. We will miss him very much,\" said Jeff Fager, the executive producer of 60 Minutes and Safer's close friend and one-time 60 Minutes producer. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR CBS News President David Rhodes said, \"Morley Safer helped create the CBS News we know today. No correspondent had more extraordinary range, from war reporting to coverage of every aspect of modern culture. His writing alone defined original reporting. Everyone at CBS News will sorely miss Morley.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Safer was a familiar reporter to millions when he replaced Harry Reasoner on 60 Minutes in 1970. A much-honored foreign correspondent, Safer was the first U.S. network newsman to film a report inside Communist China. He appeared regularly on the CBS Evening News from all over the world, especially Vietnam, where his controversial reporting earned him peer praise and government condemnation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Morley Safer helped create the CBS News we know today. No correspondent had more extraordinary range, from war reporting to coverage of every aspect of modern culture.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Safer's piece from the Vietnamese hamlet of Cam Ne in August of 1965 showing U.S. Marines burning the villagers' thatched huts was cited by New York University as one of the 20th century's best pieces of American journalism. Some believe this report freed other journalists to stop censoring themselves and tell the raw truth about war. The controversial report on the \"CBS Evening News with Walter Cronkite\" earned Safer a George Polk award and angered President Lyndon Johnson so much, he reportedly called CBS President Frank Stanton and said, \"Your boys shat on the American flag yesterday.\" Some Marines are said to have threatened Safer, but others thanked him for exposing a cruel tactic. Safer said that the pentagon treated him with contempt for the rest of his life. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He spent three tours (1964-'66) as head of the CBS Saigon bureau. His helicopter was shot down in a 1965 battle, after which Safer continued to report under fire. In 1990, he penned a memoir of his Vietnam experience, \"Flashbacks: On Returning to Vietnam\" (Random House), in which he goes back to reminisce and to interview the enemy's veterans. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When he joined Mike Wallace at the beginning of 60 Minutes' third season, they toiled to put stories on the air for a program that dodged cancellation each season. But their work was immediately recognized with an Emmy for Safer's 1971 investigation of the Gulf of Tonkin incident that began America's war in Vietnam. The two pressed on for five years, moving the broadcast from the bottom fourth to the middle of the rankings. Then in August 1975, with a new Sunday evening timeslot, Safer put 60 Minutes on the national stage. Interviewing Betty Ford, the first lady shocked many Americans by saying she would think it normal if her 18-year-old daughter were having sex. The historic sit-down also included frank talk about pot and abortion. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR By 1978, the broadcast was in Nielsen's Top 10. Safer's eloquent, sometimes quirky features balanced out the program's \"gotcha\" interviews and investigations, perfecting the news magazine's recipe. It became the number-one program for the 1979-'80 season - a crown it won five times. 60 Minutes remained in the top 10 for an unprecedented 23 straight seasons. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It was another Safer story that would become one of the program's most honored and important. \"Lenell Geter's in Jail,\" about a young black man serving life for armed robbery in Texas, overturned Geter's conviction 10 days after the December 1983 segment exposed a sloppy rush to injustice. Safer and 60 Minutes were honored with the industry's highest accolades: the Peabody, Emmy and duPont-Columbia University awards. 60 Minutes founder Don Hewitt often pointed to the story as the program's finest work. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Morley Safer's Pick: Lenell Geter's in Jail NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Safer hit more journalistic home runs, but sought out the odd stories that piqued his curiosity. The offbeat tales were more suited to his raconteur style and cultural sensibility. He found esoteric subjects all over the world and here in the U.S., ranging from a tiny Pacific island nation economically dependent on guano to the strange choice of tango dancing as a national hobby for the shy people of Finland to the strange yet harmonious stew of cowboys and artists in the Texas town of Marfa -- all narrated in his drolly delivered and precise prose. His conversational wit with his subjects was just as sharp as his written word. In a profile of the prim Martha Stewart, a smirking Safer passed her livestock pen and said to the domestic diva, \"Your barnyard? It's remarkably odor-free.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Some of these features had national impact, however, like his November 1991 report, \"The French Paradox,\" which connected red wine consumption to lower incidents of heart disease among the free-eating French. Wine merchants say this report was single-handedly responsible for starting the red wine boom in America. His 1993 segment \"Yes, But is it Art?\" enraged the modern art community when it criticized expensive, contemporary installations featuring household items like toilets and vacuums. The Museum of Modern Art in New York City may have held a grudge; years later, it refused to allow Safer onto its premises to review a Jackson Pollock retrospective for CBS Sunday Morning. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Safer's life was a work of art into which 60 Minutes fit seamlessly. He vacationed in Europe, often combining field trips for his stories. He made a regular pilgrimage to The American Academy in Rome to hone his painting skills, a hobby he began from an early age. He mounted a small exhibition of his paintings in 1985. He also had a special affinity for cars and did 60 Minutes segments on England's Rolls Royce and Italy's legendary Lamborghini. He owned a silver 1985 Ferrari convertible, which he had raced occasionally and also owned a Bentley when he lived in London, bought with his winnings from a card game. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Other highlights from Safer's 60 Minutes work include a poignant segment in 1978 called \"The Music of Auschwitz,\" about an inmate who played in an orchestra to avoid the Nazi gas chambers; his 1979 profile of Katharine Hepburn; \"The Beeb,\" a 1985 Emmy-winning take on BBC Radio; \"The Enemy,\" the 1989 story for which Safer returned to Vietnam; and in 1979, \"Marva,\" about Chicago teacher Marva Collins, whose alternative school for disadvantaged kids proved such students could excel. Safer's follow-up on \"Marva\" in 1996, in which he debunked a subsequent book that claimed Collins' students would not succeed in the long run, earned him his fourth duPont-Columbia University award. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In addition to the four duPonts, Safer won every major award, including the Paul White Award from the Radio and Television News Directors Association in 1966 when he was only 35 -- an award usually given for lifetime achievement. The other awards given to Safer over his long career include three Peabody awards, three Overseas Press Club awards, two George Polk Memorial awards, a Robert F. Kennedy Journalism first prize for domestic television, the Fred Friendly First Amendment award, 12 Emmys and a Chevalier dans l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres from the French Government. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR CBS News hired the Canadian-born Safer in 1964 in London, where he was a correspondent for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. He got the job in an odd turn of events. One of Safer's CBC colleagues seeking a job with CBS sent a demo tape of a roundtable he anchored that included Safer. CBS news executives liked Safer better and gave him a job in the London Bureau. The young correspondent took over his new job behind the desk once occupied by another CBS legend, the late Edward R. Murrow. After a year, he was asked to open the Saigon Bureau to report on the simmering conflict in Vietnam. He was then named bureau chief in London in 1967 and reported on a variety of foreign stories beyond Britain, many of them risky assignments, including the Nigerian-Biafran War, the Middle East conflict and the Russian invasion of Czechoslovakia. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR During this period he also filmed the historic CBS News Special Report \"Morley Safer's Red China Diary\" (August 1967), the first broadcast by a U.S. network news team from inside Communist China. Safer's Canadian citizenship helped get him into the country posing as a tourist interested in archeology. He and his cameraman, John Peters, were able to film the everyday lives of Chinese with a home movie camera. In a close call, suspicious authorities took Safer and Peters to meet an archeologist, who tested his knowledge. Safer knew enough about China's archeological periods to avoid arrest. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Safer's reporting and writing also appeared on the CBS News documentary series, \"CBS Reports.\" He had a regular feature on CBS Radio, \"Morley Safer's Journal,\" that ran in 1970s. In May 1994, he hosted \"One for the Road: A Conversation with Charles Kuralt and Morley Safer,\" a CBS News special marking Kuralt's retirement. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Safer was born Nov. 8, 1931 in Toronto and eventually became an American citizen, holding a dual citizenship. Telling MacLeans he felt \"stateless,\" he believed this status was an advantage. \"I bring a different perspective and I have no vested interests,\" he told the magazine in 1998. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Growing up, he was influenced by the writing of Ernest Hemingway and decided he would be a foreign correspondent. He attended the University of Western Ontario for only a few weeks when he dropped out to begin writing for newspapers. He first wrote for the rural Woodstock Sentinel-Review before landing a job with the much larger London (Ontario) Free-Press. He then went on to England with the help of the Commonwealth Press Union, which promised to place him in a job there. After a short stint on the Oxford Mail and Times, Reuters hired Safer in London in 1955. When he returned late that year, he found work as an editor and reporter in the Toronto headquarters of the CBC. He was chosen to produce \"CBC News Magazine\" in 1956, on which he also occasionally appeared . His first on-camera work was on assignment for the CBC covering the Suez Crisis in November 1956. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The CBC sent him back to London in 1961, from which he covered major stories in Europe, North Africa and the Middle East, including the war for Algerian Independence, until he joined CBS. He was the only Western correspondent in East Berlin the night the Communists began building the Berlin Wall in August 1961. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Safer was asked to characterize his legacy as a journalist in a November 2000 interview with the American Archive of Television. \"I have a pretty solid body of work that emphasized the words, emphasized ideas and the craft of writing for this medium. It's not literary, I wouldn't presume to suggest that. But I think you can elevate it a little bit sometimes with the most important part of the medium, which is what people are saying -- whether they're the people being interviewed or the guy who's telling the story. It's not literature, but it can be very classy journalism.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He is survived by his wife of 48 years, Jane, one daughter, Sarah Bakal, her husband, Alexander Bakal, three grandchildren, a sister, and brother, both of Toronto. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Funeral arrangements are private. A memorial service will be announced at a later date.\nPassage 2:\nMorley Safer, 60 Minutes' longest-serving correspondent, died this week at age 84. Last week, the broadcast aired a tribute in honor of his retirement after 46 years on the broadcast. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR To celebrate Safer's remarkable tenure, executive producer Jeff Fager called on an in-house dream team -- editor Warren Lustig and producers David Browning, Katy Textor and Michelle St. John -- to create the tribute that aired Sunday night. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But how do you condense five decades -- that included more than 900 stories -- into a one-hour broadcast? That was the enormous challenge they faced. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"In the simplest terms, we set out to capture Morley,\" says Browning, Safer's longtime producer, in the 60 Minutes Overtime video above. \"You want to make sure that what you're showing is representative of his work and the great variety of work that he's done.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That work included a groundbreaking 1965 CBS News report from Cam Ne, Vietnam, where Safer showed U.S. Marines torching villagers' huts, and a 60 Minutes story on Lenell Geter, a black man in Texas wrongly accused of armed robbery and later exonerated as a result of Safer's report. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There were countless stories, on every imaginable topic, each tale uniquely his own. \"They were works of art almost,\" Fager explains. \"What makes a story a Morley story is his original voice. And by that I mean not just the timbre, but [also] the quality of the storytelling, his writing.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Fager recalls working as Safer's producer and bringing him the first draft of a script. Safer would look at it, stare out the window for a few seconds, and then quickly scroll a piece of paper into his trusty typewriter and rework it to his own satisfaction. Textor showed Overtime one of her scripts with a yellow piece of paper taped on where Safer had added his own better-written line. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"He simply had this ability to take it to the next level,\" Browning explains. \"There's an old saying of Mark Twain's that the difference between the right word and the almost-right word is the difference between lightning and a lightning bug. And that's what Morley did. He was lightning.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While Safer claims his stories were aimed more at the ear than the eye, Fager says the correspondent's genius was his ability to link the two. \"You see lines. You hear lines. You experience while you're watching a connection with his writing to the picture,\" he says. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Safer didn't take himself too seriously, his colleagues say, and liked to entertain his viewers. \"Morley's advice was always: if you can get them to laugh, you're home free,\" recalls Textor. \"He knew that if he could get a chuckle, you were pretty good. You were going to be okay.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He also had an eye for the absurd. An amateur artist in his spare time, Safer got a kick out of ridiculing pretentiousness in the art world, even if it meant gently mocking collectors as they showed him around. \"Morley has always had a great sense of smoking out phonies and smoking out phony stories and things that just aren't right,\" Browing says. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Some of Safer's most memorable pieces were offbeat - or downright bizarre: A story on the popularity of tango in Finland, for instance, or a tale of crime and punishment on Furudu, a tiny island in the Maldives. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Morley discovered [that] a story could be essentially what you made it to be,\" says Browning. \"If you found an interesting place to go and an interesting cast of characters, it really didn't matter if there was a huge headline there. As we say in the broadcast, the journey was really the story.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It was a journey Safer enjoyed immensely. \"I've led a charmed life,\" he said in an interview. \"I mean, in every respect, I've led a charmed life as a reporter, as an individual. A lot of it is, as I said, blood, sweat, toil, and tears, but a lot of it is pure, unadulterated luck, and I've been a very lucky guy.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Photos courtesy of CBS News, CBS Photo Archive and Morley Safer NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The video above was produced by Lisa Orlando, and edited by Lisa Orlando and Will Croxton.\n\n\nNow, write a one-page summary of all the news.\n\nSummary:", "input": "", "context": "Passage 1:\nMorley Safer CBS News NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Morley Safer, the CBS newsman who changed war reporting forever when he showed U.S. Marines burning the huts of Vietnamese villagers and went on to become the iconic 60 Minutes correspondent whose stylish stories on America's most-watched news program made him one of television's most enduring stars, died today in Manhattan.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR CBS News President David Rhodes said, \"Morley Safer helped create the CBS News we know today. No correspondent had more extraordinary range, from war reporting to coverage of every aspect of modern culture. His writing alone defined original reporting. Everyone at CBS News will sorely miss Morley.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Safer was a familiar reporter to millions when he replaced Harry Reasoner on 60 Minutes in 1970. A much-honored foreign correspondent, Safer was the first U.S. network newsman to film a report inside Communist China. He appeared regularly on the CBS Evening News from all over the world, especially Vietnam, where his controversial reporting earned him peer praise and government condemnation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Morley Safer helped create the CBS News we know today. No correspondent had more extraordinary range, from war reporting to coverage of every aspect of modern culture.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Safer's piece from the Vietnamese hamlet of Cam Ne in August of 1965 showing U.S. Marines burning the villagers' thatched huts was cited by New York University as one of the 20th century's best pieces of American journalism. Some believe this report freed other journalists to stop censoring themselves and tell the raw truth about war. The controversial report on the \"CBS Evening News with Walter Cronkite\" earned Safer a George Polk award and angered President Lyndon Johnson so much, he reportedly called CBS President Frank Stanton and said, \"Your boys shat on the American flag yesterday.\" Some Marines are said to have threatened Safer, but others thanked him for exposing a cruel tactic. Safer said that the pentagon treated him with contempt for the rest of his life. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He spent three tours (1964-'66) as head of the CBS Saigon bureau. His helicopter was shot down in a 1965 battle, after which Safer continued to report under fire. In 1990, he penned a memoir of his Vietnam experience, \"Flashbacks: On Returning to Vietnam\" (Random House), in which he goes back to reminisce and to interview the enemy's veterans. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When he joined Mike Wallace at the beginning of 60 Minutes' third season, they toiled to put stories on the air for a program that dodged cancellation each season. But their work was immediately recognized with an Emmy for Safer's 1971 investigation of the Gulf of Tonkin incident that began America's war in Vietnam. The two pressed on for five years, moving the broadcast from the bottom fourth to the middle of the rankings. Then in August 1975, with a new Sunday evening timeslot, Safer put 60 Minutes on the national stage. Interviewing Betty Ford, the first lady shocked many Americans by saying she would think it normal if her 18-year-old daughter were having sex. The historic sit-down also included frank talk about pot and abortion. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR By 1978, the broadcast was in Nielsen's Top 10. Safer's eloquent, sometimes quirky features balanced out the program's \"gotcha\" interviews and investigations, perfecting the news magazine's recipe. It became the number-one program for the 1979-'80 season - a crown it won five times. 60 Minutes remained in the top 10 for an unprecedented 23 straight seasons. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It was another Safer story that would become one of the program's most honored and important. \"Lenell Geter's in Jail,\" about a young black man serving life for armed robbery in Texas, overturned Geter's conviction 10 days after the December 1983 segment exposed a sloppy rush to injustice. Safer and 60 Minutes were honored with the industry's highest accolades: the Peabody, Emmy and duPont-Columbia University awards. 60 Minutes founder Don Hewitt often pointed to the story as the program's finest work. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Morley Safer's Pick: Lenell Geter's in Jail NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Safer hit more journalistic home runs, but sought out the odd stories that piqued his curiosity. The offbeat tales were more suited to his raconteur style and cultural sensibility. He found esoteric subjects all over the world and here in the U.S., ranging from a tiny Pacific island nation economically dependent on guano to the strange choice of tango dancing as a national hobby for the shy people of Finland to the strange yet harmonious stew of cowboys and artists in the Texas town of Marfa -- all narrated in his drolly delivered and precise prose. His conversational wit with his subjects was just as sharp as his written word. In a profile of the prim Martha Stewart, a smirking Safer passed her livestock pen and said to the domestic diva, \"Your barnyard? It's remarkably odor-free.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Some of these features had national impact, however, like his November 1991 report, \"The French Paradox,\" which connected red wine consumption to lower incidents of heart disease among the free-eating French. Wine merchants say this report was single-handedly responsible for starting the red wine boom in America. His 1993 segment \"Yes, But is it Art?\" enraged the modern art community when it criticized expensive, contemporary installations featuring household items like toilets and vacuums. The Museum of Modern Art in New York City may have held a grudge; years later, it refused to allow Safer onto its premises to review a Jackson Pollock retrospective for CBS Sunday Morning. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Safer's life was a work of art into which 60 Minutes fit seamlessly. He vacationed in Europe, often combining field trips for his stories. He made a regular pilgrimage to The American Academy in Rome to hone his painting skills, a hobby he began from an early age. He mounted a small exhibition of his paintings in 1985. He also had a special affinity for cars and did 60 Minutes segments on England's Rolls Royce and Italy's legendary Lamborghini. He owned a silver 1985 Ferrari convertible, which he had raced occasionally and also owned a Bentley when he lived in London, bought with his winnings from a card game. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Other highlights from Safer's 60 Minutes work include a poignant segment in 1978 called \"The Music of Auschwitz,\" about an inmate who played in an orchestra to avoid the Nazi gas chambers; his 1979 profile of Katharine Hepburn; \"The Beeb,\" a 1985 Emmy-winning take on BBC Radio; \"The Enemy,\" the 1989 story for which Safer returned to Vietnam; and in 1979, \"Marva,\" about Chicago teacher Marva Collins, whose alternative school for disadvantaged kids proved such students could excel. Safer's follow-up on \"Marva\" in 1996, in which he debunked a subsequent book that claimed Collins' students would not succeed in the long run, earned him his fourth duPont-Columbia University award. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In addition to the four duPonts, Safer won every major award, including the Paul White Award from the Radio and Television News Directors Association in 1966 when he was only 35 -- an award usually given for lifetime achievement. The other awards given to Safer over his long career include three Peabody awards, three Overseas Press Club awards, two George Polk Memorial awards, a Robert F. Kennedy Journalism first prize for domestic television, the Fred Friendly First Amendment award, 12 Emmys and a Chevalier dans l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres from the French Government. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR CBS News hired the Canadian-born Safer in 1964 in London, where he was a correspondent for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. He got the job in an odd turn of events. One of Safer's CBC colleagues seeking a job with CBS sent a demo tape of a roundtable he anchored that included Safer. CBS news executives liked Safer better and gave him a job in the London Bureau. The young correspondent took over his new job behind the desk once occupied by another CBS legend, the late Edward R. Murrow. After a year, he was asked to open the Saigon Bureau to report on the simmering conflict in Vietnam. He was then named bureau chief in London in 1967 and reported on a variety of foreign stories beyond Britain, many of them risky assignments, including the Nigerian-Biafran War, the Middle East conflict and the Russian invasion of Czechoslovakia. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR During this period he also filmed the historic CBS News Special Report \"Morley Safer's Red China Diary\" (August 1967), the first broadcast by a U.S. network news team from inside Communist China. Safer's Canadian citizenship helped get him into the country posing as a tourist interested in archeology. He and his cameraman, John Peters, were able to film the everyday lives of Chinese with a home movie camera. In a close call, suspicious authorities took Safer and Peters to meet an archeologist, who tested his knowledge. Safer knew enough about China's archeological periods to avoid arrest. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Safer's reporting and writing also appeared on the CBS News documentary series, \"CBS Reports.\" He had a regular feature on CBS Radio, \"Morley Safer's Journal,\" that ran in 1970s. In May 1994, he hosted \"One for the Road: A Conversation with Charles Kuralt and Morley Safer,\" a CBS News special marking Kuralt's retirement. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Safer was born Nov. 8, 1931 in Toronto and eventually became an American citizen, holding a dual citizenship. Telling MacLeans he felt \"stateless,\" he believed this status was an advantage. \"I bring a different perspective and I have no vested interests,\" he told the magazine in 1998. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Growing up, he was influenced by the writing of Ernest Hemingway and decided he would be a foreign correspondent. He attended the University of Western Ontario for only a few weeks when he dropped out to begin writing for newspapers. He first wrote for the rural Woodstock Sentinel-Review before landing a job with the much larger London (Ontario) Free-Press. He then went on to England with the help of the Commonwealth Press Union, which promised to place him in a job there. After a short stint on the Oxford Mail and Times, Reuters hired Safer in London in 1955. When he returned late that year, he found work as an editor and reporter in the Toronto headquarters of the CBC. He was chosen to produce \"CBC News Magazine\" in 1956, on which he also occasionally appeared . His first on-camera work was on assignment for the CBC covering the Suez Crisis in November 1956. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The CBC sent him back to London in 1961, from which he covered major stories in Europe, North Africa and the Middle East, including the war for Algerian Independence, until he joined CBS. He was the only Western correspondent in East Berlin the night the Communists began building the Berlin Wall in August 1961. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Safer was asked to characterize his legacy as a journalist in a November 2000 interview with the American Archive of Television. \"I have a pretty solid body of work that emphasized the words, emphasized ideas and the craft of writing for this medium. It's not literary, I wouldn't presume to suggest that. But I think you can elevate it a little bit sometimes with the most important part of the medium, which is what people are saying -- whether they're the people being interviewed or the guy who's telling the story. It's not literature, but it can be very classy journalism.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He is survived by his wife of 48 years, Jane, one daughter, Sarah Bakal, her husband, Alexander Bakal, three grandchildren, a sister, and brother, both of Toronto. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Funeral arrangements are private. A memorial service will be announced at a later date.\nPassage 2:\nMorley Safer, 60 Minutes' longest-serving correspondent, died this week at age 84. Last week, the broadcast aired a tribute in honor of his retirement after 46 years on the broadcast. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR To celebrate Safer's remarkable tenure, executive producer Jeff Fager called on an in-house dream team -- editor Warren Lustig and producers David Browning, Katy Textor and Michelle St. John -- to create the tribute that aired Sunday night. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But how do you condense five decades -- that included more than 900 stories -- into a one-hour broadcast? That was the enormous challenge they faced. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"In the simplest terms, we set out to capture Morley,\" says Browning, Safer's longtime producer, in the 60 Minutes Overtime video above. \"You want to make sure that what you're showing is representative of his work and the great variety of work that he's done.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That work included a groundbreaking 1965 CBS News report from Cam Ne, Vietnam, where Safer showed U.S. Marines torching villagers' huts, and a 60 Minutes story on Lenell Geter, a black man in Texas wrongly accused of armed robbery and later exonerated as a result of Safer's report. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There were countless stories, on every imaginable topic, each tale uniquely his own. \"They were works of art almost,\" Fager explains. \"What makes a story a Morley story is his original voice. And by that I mean not just the timbre, but [also] the quality of the storytelling, his writing.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Fager recalls working as Safer's producer and bringing him the first draft of a script. Safer would look at it, stare out the window for a few seconds, and then quickly scroll a piece of paper into his trusty typewriter and rework it to his own satisfaction. Textor showed Overtime one of her scripts with a yellow piece of paper taped on where Safer had added his own better-written line. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"He simply had this ability to take it to the next level,\" Browning explains. \"There's an old saying of Mark Twain's that the difference between the right word and the almost-right word is the difference between lightning and a lightning bug. And that's what Morley did. He was lightning.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While Safer claims his stories were aimed more at the ear than the eye, Fager says the correspondent's genius was his ability to link the two. \"You see lines. You hear lines. You experience while you're watching a connection with his writing to the picture,\" he says. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Safer didn't take himself too seriously, his colleagues say, and liked to entertain his viewers. \"Morley's advice was always: if you can get them to laugh, you're home free,\" recalls Textor. \"He knew that if he could get a chuckle, you were pretty good. You were going to be okay.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He also had an eye for the absurd. An amateur artist in his spare time, Safer got a kick out of ridiculing pretentiousness in the art world, even if it meant gently mocking collectors as they showed him around. \"Morley has always had a great sense of smoking out phonies and smoking out phony stories and things that just aren't right,\" Browing says. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Some of Safer's most memorable pieces were offbeat - or downright bizarre: A story on the popularity of tango in Finland, for instance, or a tale of crime and punishment on Furudu, a tiny island in the Maldives. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Morley discovered [that] a story could be essentially what you made it to be,\" says Browning. \"If you found an interesting place to go and an interesting cast of characters, it really didn't matter if there was a huge headline there. As we say in the broadcast, the journey was really the story.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It was a journey Safer enjoyed immensely. \"I've led a charmed life,\" he said in an interview. \"I mean, in every respect, I've led a charmed life as a reporter, as an individual. A lot of it is, as I said, blood, sweat, toil, and tears, but a lot of it is pure, unadulterated luck, and I've been a very lucky guy.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Photos courtesy of CBS News, CBS Photo Archive and Morley Safer NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The video above was produced by Lisa Orlando, and edited by Lisa Orlando and Will Croxton.\n", "answers": ["Just days after retiring from 60 Minutes, Morley Safer is dead at age 84, reports CBS News.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Now we know, sort of, thanks to a publicity-stunt press conference during which one cell phone offender \u2014 the guy who tried to charge his phone by plugging it in to an onstage outlet at play \u201cHand to God\u201d \u2014 spoke out. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cI downed a few drinks, and I think that clearly impaired my judgment,\u201d said Nick Silvestri, a 19-year-old from Long Island. \u201cI guess I wasn\u2019t really thinking.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Producers of \u201cHand to God\u201d held the press conference July 10 to capitalize on the flurry of attention recently given to what has been a source of long-simmering tension among theatergoers. For years, stage folks have decried the regular mid-show disruptions wrought by the advent of the mobile phone. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The issue has reached something of a tipping point recently, with Patti LuPone making headlines earlier this week for snatching away the phone of a texting audience member at the Off Broadway show in which she stars, \u201cShows for Days\u201d \u2014 and doing it without ever breaking character. (The phone was returned to its owner after the show.) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Just a few days before that, Silvestri earned the ire of the theater community when, minutes before a performance of \u201cHand to God,\u201d he leapt onto the stage and plugged his phone into what turned out to be a fake electrical outlet. Cast members chronicled it on Twitter. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A guy jumped on the stage and plugged his phone into the fake outlet on our set just before we started. @HandtoGodBway #fullmoon or #idiot ? \u2014 Sarah Stiles (@Lulubellestiles) July 3, 2015 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Earlier this spring, Madonna attracted disapproval for reportedly texting during hot-ticket musical \u201cHamilton.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The dust-ups highlight the complaints that arise with increasing frequency as texting, ringtones and phone calls intrude on what\u2019s long been the traditional theater etiquette of a dark, quiet auditorium. It\u2019s a regular occurrence at Broadway shows these days, thanks to the omnipresence of mobile devices, not to mention the increasing presence of tourists and young audiences \u2014 some of whom have never been to a Broadway show. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cI don\u2019t go to plays very much, and I didn\u2019t realize that the stage is considered off limits,\u201d Silvestri said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There\u2019s something of a generational divide, too, between the traditionally older-skewing theatergoing demographic and the younger audiences who have grown up in the digital, mobile era \u2014 for whom mobile device usage is akin to a basic civil right. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The press conference with Silvestri, held in front of the Booth Theater, took advantage of the cell-phone incident (which was not a stunt, Silvestri assured people) to lend a little publicity to \u201cHand to God,\u201d the Broadway comedy that earned strong reviews (and five Tony nominations) but has largely struggled to gain momentum at the box office. The event also gave Silvestri the chance to apologize. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cI\u2019ve learned a lot about the theater in the past few days \u2014 theater people are really passionate and have been very willing to educate me,\u201d he said. \u201cI would like to sincerely apologize to the Broadway community.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That might not be enough for LuPone, who\u2019s famously tough on folks who use cell phones during her shows. During the 2008 run of \u201cGypsy,\u201d she stopped the show when someone was taking pictures. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cWe work hard on stage to create a world that is being totally destroyed by a few, rude, self-absorbed and inconsiderate audience members who are controlled by their phones,\u201d LuPone said after the July 8 incident at \u201cShows for Days.\u201d \u201cI am so defeated by this issue that I seriously question whether I want to work on stage anymore. Now I\u2019m putting battle gear on over my costume to marshal the audience as well as perform.\u201d\nPassage 2:\nNEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR IN PERSON (Jen Chung/Gothamist) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Long Island lacrosse-playing college student who burst into Broadway history as the first, social media-documented idiot to barge onto a stage to charge his precious cellphone faced the press today. Nick Silvestri, 19, read a statement before a group of reporters admitting, \"I don\u2019t go to plays very much, and I didn\u2019t realize that the stage is considered off limits. I\u2019ve learned a lot about the theater in the past few days\u2014theater people are really passionate and have been very willing to educate me. I can assure you that I won\u2019t be setting foot on a stage ever again, unless I decide to become an actor.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Publicists for Hand to God, the \"hilarious and disturbing\" play that transferred from off-Broadway and earned numerous Tony nominations, had initially said the press conference would start at 2 p.m., but Silvestri, who attends Nassau Community College, didn't surface until 2:30. He then gamely read a statement (see text below) but he stumbled over the word \"theatergoer\" and was immediately bombarded with questions from the skeptical press. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For instance, were he and Hand to God producers in cahoots to draw attention for the play? Especially considering that it's struggling at the box office? Silvestri seemed confused, and insisted that he wasn't part of a viral marketing stunt, telling reporters, \"Take it as it is. It's fun. It's a joke.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And even though he said in his statement that he had been drinking, reporters pointed out that he's underage. He then became vague about the drinking, denying drinking in NYC, and a publicist for the show kept Silvestri from answering our probing questions, such as \"Do you have the phone?\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It seems possible that a drunken Silvestri was dared to go charge his phone onstage by a friend who then filmed him. When reports of the \"Juice Jackal\" surfaced the next day, his friend proceeded to post the video on YouTube. Virality was instantly achieved, and Silvestri is clearly relishing the attention: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Just wanna give a huge shoutout to all my fans and followers. This wouldn't be possible it it wasn't for u guys xoxoxox #muchlove \u2014 nick silvestri (@NickSilvestri2) July 10, 2015 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If you watch the video, you'll see Silvestri's friend snickering in the background throughout the press conference.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Now we know, sort of, thanks to a publicity-stunt press conference during which one cell phone offender \u2014 the guy who tried to charge his phone by plugging it in to an onstage outlet at play \u201cHand to God\u201d \u2014 spoke out. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cI downed a few drinks, and I think that clearly impaired my judgment,\u201d said Nick Silvestri, a 19-year-old from Long Island. \u201cI guess I wasn\u2019t really thinking.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Producers of \u201cHand to God\u201d held the press conference July 10 to capitalize on the flurry of attention recently given to what has been a source of long-simmering tension among theatergoers. For years, stage folks have decried the regular mid-show disruptions wrought by the advent of the mobile phone. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The issue has reached something of a tipping point recently, with Patti LuPone making headlines earlier this week for snatching away the phone of a texting audience member at the Off Broadway show in which she stars, \u201cShows for Days\u201d \u2014 and doing it without ever breaking character. (The phone was returned to its owner after the show.) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Just a few days before that, Silvestri earned the ire of the theater community when, minutes before a performance of \u201cHand to God,\u201d he leapt onto the stage and plugged his phone into what turned out to be a fake electrical outlet. Cast members chronicled it on Twitter. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A guy jumped on the stage and plugged his phone into the fake outlet on our set just before we started. @HandtoGodBway #fullmoon or #idiot ? \u2014 Sarah Stiles (@Lulubellestiles) July 3, 2015 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Earlier this spring, Madonna attracted disapproval for reportedly texting during hot-ticket musical \u201cHamilton.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The dust-ups highlight the complaints that arise with increasing frequency as texting, ringtones and phone calls intrude on what\u2019s long been the traditional theater etiquette of a dark, quiet auditorium. It\u2019s a regular occurrence at Broadway shows these days, thanks to the omnipresence of mobile devices, not to mention the increasing presence of tourists and young audiences \u2014 some of whom have never been to a Broadway show. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cI don\u2019t go to plays very much, and I didn\u2019t realize that the stage is considered off limits,\u201d Silvestri said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There\u2019s something of a generational divide, too, between the traditionally older-skewing theatergoing demographic and the younger audiences who have grown up in the digital, mobile era \u2014 for whom mobile device usage is akin to a basic civil right. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The press conference with Silvestri, held in front of the Booth Theater, took advantage of the cell-phone incident (which was not a stunt, Silvestri assured people) to lend a little publicity to \u201cHand to God,\u201d the Broadway comedy that earned strong reviews (and five Tony nominations) but has largely struggled to gain momentum at the box office.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cWe work hard on stage to create a world that is being totally destroyed by a few, rude, self-absorbed and inconsiderate audience members who are controlled by their phones,\u201d LuPone said after the July 8 incident at \u201cShows for Days.\u201d \u201cI am so defeated by this issue that I seriously question whether I want to work on stage anymore.

Nick Silvestri, 19, read a statement before a group of reporters admitting, \"I don\u2019t go to plays very much, and I didn\u2019t realize that the stage is considered off limits. I\u2019ve learned a lot about the theater in the past few days\u2014theater people are really passionate and have been very willing to educate me. I can assure you that I won\u2019t be setting foot on a stage ever again, unless I decide to become an actor.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Publicists for Hand to God, the \"hilarious and disturbing\" play that transferred from off-Broadway and earned numerous Tony nominations, had initially said the press conference would start at 2 p.m., but Silvestri, who attends Nassau Community College, didn't surface until 2:30. He then gamely read a statement (see text below) but he stumbled over the word \"theatergoer\" and was immediately bombarded with questions from the skeptical press. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For instance, were he and Hand to God producers in cahoots to draw attention for the play? Especially considering that it's struggling at the box office? Silvestri seemed confused, and insisted that he wasn't part of a viral marketing stunt, telling reporters, \"Take it as it is. It's fun. It's a joke.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And even though he said in his statement that he had been drinking, reporters pointed out that he's underage. He then became vague about the drinking, denying drinking in NYC, and a publicist for the show kept Silvestri from answering our probing questions, such as \"Do you have the phone?\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It seems possible that a drunken Silvestri was dared to go charge his phone onstage by a friend who then filmed him. When reports of the \"Juice Jackal\" surfaced the next day, his friend proceeded to post the video on YouTube. Virality was instantly achieved, and Silvestri is clearly relishing the attention: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Just wanna give a huge shoutout to all my fans and followers.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR According to a study published in the PLOS ONE scientific journal, the Clarion nightsnake was found again on one of the Revillagigedo Islands, more than 400 miles (650 kilometers) off Mexico's Pacific coast. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The original, and until recently the only, spotting of the species was made by American naturalist William Beebe in a 1936 visit to Clarion, one of the four Revillagigedo Islands. He returned with one snake preserved in a glass jar. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Subsequent visits failed to find more nightsnakes, and no further sightings were reported over the years from the island, which is inhabited only by a small detachment of Mexican marines.

A Spanish archaeologist tells the Local he was \"horrified\" by the \"monumental error\" after an environmental group discovered what had happened in June. Town officials say they weren't aware the tomb was even there, despite it being listed as a heritage site. \"No one told me,\" the mayor tells El Huffington Post. \"The site wasn't even marked.\" But a regional government department is investigating the situation and tells the Local \"the town council was well aware of its existence.\" According to NPR, this kind of thing isn't unheard of. Two years ago, workers in Belize accidentally ruined a 2,300-year-old Mayan pyramid because they needed rubble to fix a road. But more often these ancient sites are destroyed on purpose. Last year, for example, developers dismantled a Native American burial ground in California to make room for some million-dollar homes.

If the town ever made national news, it was because a presidential candidate stopped by vowing to fix things, only for those promises to evaporate after Election Day. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But in the past couple of months, Chillicothe has crept back into headlines for something other than a stump speech. Something much darker. Something evil. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Chillicothe is no longer just another Rust Belt town. Now it\u2019s the place where women go missing and wash up dead. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In little over a year, at least six women have disappeared from the town of only 21,000. Four of their bodies have been found, almost all of them dumped in creeks or streams flowing away from the town. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The women have similar stories. Most of them were hooked on drugs, and many moonlighted as prostitutes to fund their addictions, police say. Some of them even knew one another. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The similarities between the victims and the crime scenes have Chillicothe terrified that a serial killer is on the loose. Local police, several county sheriffs\u2019 offices and state investigators have banded together to solve the spiraling murder mystery.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Finally, last Saturday, Sayre became the latest victim in the string of deadly disappearances. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A couple out for a Saturday evening walk through a nature preserve south of Chillicothe spotted something white at the edge of a drainage pipe running underneath the road.

The grisly discovery helped launch the task force, which now includes more than a dozen members, including the FBI analysts, according to Preston. The task force is investigating the cases of all six women, even those formerly considered suicides. According to media reports, the investigation could also expand to at least three other women who went missing from nearby Portsmouth and Columbus. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A serial killer is a possibility, Preston admitted. He said officials were studying the apparent pattern of the dumping of the bodies along waterways outside the city.

He added that the task force had received more than 100 tips in just a few days but is still searching for a witness. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cA lot of those people may be afraid to come forward,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they are afraid, they can let us know anonymously. We just want the information.

(The Washington Post) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For years, Chillicothe, Ohio, was known as just another notch on the Rust Belt, afflicted by the same old problems of drugs, poverty and unemployment. If the town ever made national news, it was because a presidential candidate stopped by vowing to fix things, only for those promises to evaporate after Election Day. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But in the past couple of months, Chillicothe has crept back into headlines for something other than a stump speech. Something much darker. Something evil. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Chillicothe is no longer just another Rust Belt town. Now it\u2019s the place where women go missing and wash up dead. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In little over a year, at least six women have disappeared from the town of only 21,000. Four of their bodies have been found, almost all of them dumped in creeks or streams flowing away from the town. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The women have similar stories. Most of them were hooked on drugs, and many moonlighted as prostitutes to fund their addictions, police say. Some of them even knew one another. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The similarities between the victims and the crime scenes have Chillicothe terrified that a serial killer is on the loose. Local police, several county sheriffs\u2019 offices and state investigators have banded together to solve the spiraling murder mystery. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Even FBI analysts are assisting with the investigation, busy compiling a profile of a possible serial killer. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cI don\u2019t want to come out and say \u2018yes, we have a serial killer,\u2019 but it\u2019s a small community that we live in \u2026 and the number of females who have come up missing, and then the bodies that we\u2019ve found, that\u2019s quite a bit for our community,\u201d Staff Lt. Mike Preston of the Ross County Sheriff\u2019s Department told The Washington Post. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cThe community is starting to get concerned,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone just wants answers.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the absence of answers \u2014 and arrests \u2014 residents are getting scared. The fear that a serial killer is stalking prostitutes swirls around Chillicothe. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cObviously there has to be something going on,\u201d said Jessica Sayre, whose older sister, Tiffany, was the latest victim. Her body was found in a drainage pipe Saturday after she had been missing for more than a month. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cApparently my sister was the next target,\u201d Jessica Sayre said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The women began disappearing a year ago from Chillicothe, a town about an hour south of Columbus. Ohio\u2019s first capital more than 200 years ago \u2014 a title still boasted on city signs \u2014 Chillicothe has fallen far. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cWe are battling a problem with heroin in our community,\u201d Preston said. Prostitution is on the rise as well, he acknowledged. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Charlotte Trego was the first to vanish. In her late 20s with wavy brown hair and glasses, the mother of two young kids had fallen on hard times. \u201cShe started taking pain pills and graduated to heroin,\u201d according to the Columbus Dispatch. In the spring of 2014, Trego told her mother that she was ready to get clean. Her mom found a rehab center. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But then Trego was evicted by her roommate, according to the Chillicothe Gazette. She was last seen May 3, 2014. It was as if Chillicothe\u2019s increasingly dangerous streets simply swallowed her whole. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That same day, a friend of Trego\u2019s, Tameka Lynch, also vanished. Like Trego, Lynch had drug problems.

The Ross County coroner\u2019s office determined that she had died of a multiple-drug overdose.

Buell said he got clean a year ago, but Sayre couldn\u2019t, and the couple broke up.

But when her new boyfriend died in April from a blood clot, Tiffany went back to drugs and the vices that funded her addiction. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cIt hit my sister really hard. She really loved him,\u201d Jessica Sayre said. \u201cThey had planned on moving, going to this other place, actually getting married and having a life together.

McCrary, a 36-year-old convicted sex offender, as the prime suspect in the killing but have not yet charged him with the crime.) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Finally, last Saturday, Sayre became the latest victim in the string of deadly disappearances. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A couple out for a Saturday evening walk through a nature preserve south of Chillicothe spotted something white at the edge of a drainage pipe running underneath the road.

The grisly discovery helped launch the task force, which now includes more than a dozen members, including the FBI analysts, according to Preston. The task force is investigating the cases of all six women, even those formerly considered suicides. According to media reports, the investigation could also expand to at least three other women who went missing from nearby Portsmouth and Columbus.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR MEGAN LANCASTER NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"These girls all knew the same people,\" Lancaster's sister-in-law, Kadie Lancaster, told HuffPost. \"I think it's possible these and other cases, as far off as Michigan, are all connected.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Megan Lancaster, the mother of a 9-year-old boy, was last seen in Portsmouth on April 3, 2013.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In a series of impromptu statements about nuclear weapons, Donald Trump is threatening to upend longstanding U.S. nonproliferation policy, even as his advisers contradict him and muddy his intentions. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The president-elect had alarmed and perplexed some experts and others in Washington when he pronounced, without offering more details, via Twitter on Thursday that the U.S. \u201cmust greatly strengthen and expand its nuclear capability until such time as the world comes to its senses regarding nukes.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Story Continued Below NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He further escalated his call on Friday, telling the MSNBC program \u201cMorning Joe\u201d that he is fine with the country taking part in an \u201carms race\u201d if it puts the U.S. in a stronger position against foreign adversaries. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cLet it be an arms race \u2026 we will outmatch them at every pass and outlast them all,\u201d Trump said in an off-air conversation on Friday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After the remark was reported on MSNBC, though, incoming Trump press secretary Sean Spicer pushed back and insisted that the remarks came from a \u201cprivate conversation\u201d with \u201cMorning Joe\u201d host Mika Brzezinski. While he told the \u201cToday\u201d Show\u2019s Matt Lauer that \u201cthere is not going to be\u201d an arms race, he told CNN that Trump is not going to \u201ctake anything off the table,\u201d either. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It remains unclear where the president-elect stands, but given longstanding bipartisan support for preventing nuclear escalation, if followed through Trump\u2019s statements would represent an extraordinary shift in how the U.S. approaches the role of weapons of mass destruction in its own defenses and throughout the world. President Barack Obama has advanced a vision of \u201cAmerica's commitment to seek the peace and security of a world without nuclear weapons.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At first, after his Thursday tweet, Trump\u2019s own supporters had tried to downplay what it meant. It was unclear, for example, whether Trump was advocating the U.S. increasing the size of its nuclear arsenal, which would be a major change, or if he was speaking of modernizing it. Such a suggestion would be in line with ongoing efforts and not necessarily controversial. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kellyanne Conway, Trump\u2019s former campaign manager who was recently named incoming counselor to the president, told an irate Rachel Maddow on Thursday night that Trump may have meant the latter. Regardless, Conway insisted during the heated exchange on MSNBC, the tweet did not necessarily represent a policy change, but Trump \u201ctalking about keeping us safe and secure.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cThere are a lot of people hiding under the bed right now because it doesn\u2019t seem like he knows what he\u2019s talking about on this issue,\u201d Maddow said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cThat\u2019s not fair,\u201d Conway responded, later adding, \u201cHe\u2019s not making policy on Twitter. \u2026 Again, perhaps he is also echoing what President Obama himself has tried to do here, which is get upgrades to our nuclear systems.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jason Miller, a Trump spokesman, had also said on Thursday that the president-elect was talking about expanding nonproliferation efforts, not stoking an arms race. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"President-elect Trump was referring to the threat of nuclear proliferation and the critical need to prevent it \u2014 particularly to and among terrorist organizations and unstable and rogue regimes,\" Miller said in a statement. \"He has also emphasized the need to improve and modernize our deterrent capability as a vital way to pursue peace through strength.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump\u2019s comments Friday, of course, seemed to directly contradict that. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The controversy started after Russian President Vladimir Putin called on his country to \u201cstrengthen\u201d its nuclear forces. \u201cWe need to strengthen the military potential of strategic nuclear forces, especially with missile complexes that can reliably penetrate any existing and prospective missile defense systems,\u201d he said earlier this week, according to multiple news reports. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But Putin at an annual news conference on Friday said Russia has no interest in a nuclear arms race and seemed to normalize Trump\u2019s statements, calling his tweet unsurprising. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cOf course the U.S. has more missiles, submarines and aircraft carriers, but what we say is that we are stronger than any aggressor, and this is the case,\u201d Putin said, adding, \u201cAs for Donald Trump, there is nothing new about it, during his elections campaign he said the U.S. needs to bolster its nuclear capabilities and its armed forces in general.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR During the election season, Trump made contradictory statements about nuclear proliferation. He suggested that some countries \u2014 including Japan, South Korea and Saudi Arabia \u2014 should be allowed to develop them, despite efforts to prevent more countries from doing so. But he also told The New York Times in March that \u201cit\u2019s a very scary nuclear world.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cBiggest problem, to me, in the world, is nuclear, and proliferation,\u201d Trump said at the time. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump\u2019s more recent comments about expanding America\u2019s nuclear capability go against decades of policy to reduce the stockpile of nuclear warheads and could potentially violate an arms control treaty with Russia. The U.S. has a stockpile of roughly 4,500 nuclear warheads and nearly 1,500 deployed warheads (Russia\u2019s armaments are nearly identical, as both nations account for more than 90 percent of the world\u2019s nuclear warheads). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The U.S. and Russia are due to meet nuclear reduction targets by February 2018 under the New START Treaty, which can be extended for another five years in 2021. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Experts remain confused and in some cases unnerved by the nature of Trump\u2019s foray into the nuclear weapons discussion. On Thursday, John Tierney, a former Democratic congressman and current executive director of the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation, presented Trump\u2019s tweet as perilous. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cIt is dangerous for the President-elect to use just 140 characters and announce a major change in U.S. nuclear weapons policy, which is nuanced, complex, and affects every single person on this planet,\u201d he said in a statement, warning that an expansion threatens a nuclear arms race. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cThe potential consequences of changing U.S. nuclear weapons policy so drastically are simply unimaginable,\u201d he warned. \u201cCurrent plans already call for spending $1 trillion over the next three decades to modernize and maintain the U.S. nuclear arsenal, which the Pentagon has expressed concern about being able to afford. The President-elect will have to explain why any increase is necessary both financially and strategically.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Joseph Cirincione, the president of the global security foundation Ploughshares Fund and a nuclear weapons expert, called Trump's actions \u201cbizarre, unprecedented and completely out of bounds behavior for a president-elect.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Incoming presidents usually wait until they take office to make pronouncements on a topic like nuclear policy, Cirincione said. Beyond that, he said he is alarmed by the cavalier attitude Trump seems to have toward as enormously sensitive an issue as weapons of mass destruction. While Trump might see Twitter as a means to convey strength to his constituents at home, Cirincione said, \u201cthe rest of the world is watching,\u201d and other countries could respond with actions of their own. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cYou can\u2019t use Twitter to make nuclear policy,\u201d Cirincione said. \u201cLook, you should at least wait until you\u2019re president. But this is why \u2014 this kind of view that he\u2019s breaking with convention, he wants to shake things up, I understand that, but not on nuclear policy. There are reasons why people spend days crafting the language of nuclear policy.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cThese things can be very complicated,\u201d he continued, \u201cand every word matters.\u201d\nPassage 2:\nThis is probably not the first day on the job that Sean Spicer imagined it would be. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Already he has done a merry-go-round of morning show appearances since it was announced Thursday that he will serve as our nation\u2019s next White House Press Secretary, set to take office with the Trump administration next month. However, his first day is off to an, uhh, let\u2019s call it interesting start; during an off-air conversation this morning with Mika Brzezinski of MSNBC, the President-elect surprisingly said of nuclear proliferation, \u201cLet it be an arms race, we will outmatch them at every pass.

We go and we send 50 soldiers over to the Middle East and President Obama gets up and announces that we\u2019re sending 50 soldiers to the Middle East. Fifty very special soldiers. And they now have a target on their back, and everything we do, we announce, instead of winning, and announcing when it\u2019s all over.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR How to Defeat ISIS NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR HABERMAN: Mr. Trump, you have talked about your plans to defeat ISIS, and how you would approach it. Would you be willing to stop buying oil from the Saudis if they\u2019re unwilling to go in and help? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR SANGER: On the ground? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR TRUMP: Oh yeah, sure. I would do that. The beautiful thing about oil is that, you know, we\u2019re really getting close, because of fracking, and because of new technology, we\u2019re really in a position that we weren\u2019t in, you know, years ago, and the reason we\u2019re in the Middle East is for oil. And all of a sudden we\u2019re finding out that there\u2019s less reason to be. Now, now, we\u2019re in the Middle East for really defense, because we can\u2019t allow them, I mean, look, I was against the war in Iraq. I thought it would destabilize the Middle East, and it has destabilized it, it\u2019s totally destabilized the Middle East. The way Obama got out of the war was, you know, disgraceful, and idiotic. When he announced the date certain, they pulled back, and they said, \u201cOh, well.\u201d As much as they don\u2019t mind dying, they do mind dying. And they pulled back, and then, you know, it\u2019s a, it was a terrible thing the way he announced that, and then he didn\u2019t leave troops behind so that, you know, whatever there was of Iraq, which in my opinion wasn\u2019t very much, because I think that, you know, the government was totally corrupt, and they put the wrong people in charge, and you know, that in its own way led to the formation of ISIS, because they weren\u2019t given their due. But, I think that President Obama, the way he got out of that war was unbelievable. I think Hillary Clinton was catastrophic in those decisions, having to do with Libya and just about everything else. Every bad decision that you could make in the Middle East was made. And now if you look at it, if you would go back 15 years ago, and I\u2019m not saying it was only Obama, It was Obama\u2019s getting out, it was other people\u2019s getting in, but you go back 15 years ago, and I say this, if our presidents would have just gone to the beach and enjoyed the ocean and the sun, we would\u2019ve been much better off in the Middle East, than all of this tremendous death, destruction, and you know, monetary loss, it\u2019s just incredible. \u2019Cause we\u2019re further, we\u2019re far worse off today than we were 15 years ago or 10 years ago in the Middle East. Far worse. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR SANGER: But I just want to make sure I understand your answer to Maggie\u2019s question. So you said earlier this week that we should use air power but not send in ground forces. That had to be done by the regional Arab partners. We assume by that, you mean the Saudis, the U.A.E. and others from whom we might purchase oil or have alliances. I think Maggie\u2019s question, if I understood it right, was if these countries are unwilling to send in ground troops against ISIS, and so far they have been, despite President Obama\u2019s efforts to get them in, would you be willing to say, \u201cWe will stop buying oil from you, until you send ground troops?\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR TRUMP: There\u2019s two answers to that. The answer is, probably yes, but I would also say this: We are not being reimbursed for our protection of many of the countries that you\u2019ll be talking about, that, including Saudi Arabia. You know, Saudi Arabia, for a period of time, now the oil has gone down, but still the numbers are phenomenal, and the amount of money they have is phenomenal. But we protect countries, and take tremendous monetary hits on protecting countries. That would include Saudi Arabia, but it would include many other countries, as you know. We have, there\u2019s a whole big list of them. We lose, everywhere. We lose monetarily, everywhere. And yet, without us, Saudi Arabia wouldn\u2019t exist for very long. It would be, you know, a catastrophic failure without our protection. And I\u2019m trying to figure out, why is it that we aren\u2019t going in and saying, at a minimum, at a minimum it\u2019s a two-part question, with respect to Maggie\u2019s question. But why aren\u2019t we going in and saying, \u201cAt a minimum, I\u2019m sorry folks, but you have to, under no circumstances can we continue to do this.\u201d You know, we needed, we needed oil desperately years ago. Today, because \u2013 again, because of the new technologies, and because of places that we never thought had oil, and they do have oil, and there\u2019s a glut on the market, there\u2019s a tremendous glut on the market, I mean you have ships out at sea that are loaded up and they don\u2019t even know where to go dump it. But we don\u2019t have that same pressure anymore, at all. And we shouldn\u2019t have that for a long period of time, because there\u2019s so many places. I mean, they\u2019re closing wells all over the place. So, I would say this, I would say at a minimum, we have to be reimbursed, substantially reimbursed, I mean, to a point that\u2019s far greater than what we\u2019re being paid right now. Because we\u2019re not being reimbursed for the kind of tremendous service that we\u2019re performing by protecting various countries. Now Saudi Arabia\u2019s one of them. I think if Saudi Arabia was without the cloak of American protection of our country\u2019s, of U.S. protection, think of Saudi Arabia. I don\u2019t think it would be around. It would be, whether it was internal or external, it wouldn\u2019t be around for very long. And they\u2019re a money machine, they\u2019re a monetary machine, and yet they don\u2019t reimburse us the way we should be reimbursed. So that\u2019s a real problem. And frankly, I think it\u2019s a real, in terms of bringing our country back, because our country\u2019s a poor country. Our country is a debtor nation, we\u2019re a debtor nation. I mean, we owe trillions of dollars to people that are buying our bonds, in the form of other countries. You look at China, where we owe them $1.7 trillion, you have Japan, $1.5 trillion. We\u2019re a debtor nation. We can\u2019t be a debtor nation. I don\u2019t want to be a debtor nation. I want it to be the other way. One of the reasons we\u2019re a debtor nation, we spend so much on the military, but the military isn\u2019t for us. The military is to be policeman for other countries. And to watch over other countries. And there comes a point that, and many of these countries are tremendously rich countries. Not powerful countries, but \u2013 in some cases they are powerful \u2013 but rich countries. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR SANGER: One more along the lines of your ISIS strategy. You\u2019ve seen the current strategy, which is, you\u2019ve seen Secretary Kerry trying to seek a political accord between President Assad and the rebel forces, with Assad eventually leaving. And then the hope is to turn all those forces, including Russia and Iran, against ISIS. Is that the right way to do it? Do you have an alternative approach? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR TRUMP: Well, I thought the approach of fighting Assad and ISIS simultaneously was madness, and idiocy. They\u2019re fighting each other and yet we\u2019re fighting both of them. You know, we were fighting both of them. I think that our far bigger problem than Assad is ISIS, I\u2019ve always felt that. Assad is, you know I\u2019m not saying Assad is a good man, \u2019cause he\u2019s not, but our far greater problem is not Assad, it\u2019s ISIS.\nPassage 4:\nA Russian Topol-M intercontinental ballistic missile with a range of some 11,000 kilometres (6,800 miles) and capable of carrying a warhead of up to one megaton, the equivalent of one million tons of TNT explosive (AFP Photo/DMITRY KOSTYUKOV) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Moscow (AFP) - Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday called for the country to reinforce its military nuclear potential and praised the army's performance in its Syria campaign.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In a series of impromptu statements about nuclear weapons, Donald Trump is threatening to upend longstanding U.S. nonproliferation policy, even as his advisers contradict him and muddy his intentions. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The president-elect had alarmed and perplexed some experts and others in Washington when he pronounced, without offering more details, via Twitter on Thursday that the U.S. \u201cmust greatly strengthen and expand its nuclear capability until such time as the world comes to its senses regarding nukes.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Story Continued Below NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He further escalated his call on Friday, telling the MSNBC program \u201cMorning Joe\u201d that he is fine with the country taking part in an \u201carms race\u201d if it puts the U.S. in a stronger position against foreign adversaries. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cLet it be an arms race \u2026 we will outmatch them at every pass and outlast them all,\u201d Trump said in an off-air conversation on Friday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After the remark was reported on MSNBC, though, incoming Trump press secretary Sean Spicer pushed back and insisted that the remarks came from a \u201cprivate conversation\u201d with \u201cMorning Joe\u201d host Mika Brzezinski. While he told the \u201cToday\u201d Show\u2019s Matt Lauer that \u201cthere is not going to be\u201d an arms race, he told CNN that Trump is not going to \u201ctake anything off the table,\u201d either. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It remains unclear where the president-elect stands, but given longstanding bipartisan support for preventing nuclear escalation, if followed through Trump\u2019s statements would represent an extraordinary shift in how the U.S. approaches the role of weapons of mass destruction in its own defenses and throughout the world. President Barack Obama has advanced a vision of \u201cAmerica's commitment to seek the peace and security of a world without nuclear weapons.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At first, after his Thursday tweet, Trump\u2019s own supporters had tried to downplay what it meant. It was unclear, for example, whether Trump was advocating the U.S. increasing the size of its nuclear arsenal, which would be a major change, or if he was speaking of modernizing it. Such a suggestion would be in line with ongoing efforts and not necessarily controversial. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kellyanne Conway, Trump\u2019s former campaign manager who was recently named incoming counselor to the president, told an irate Rachel Maddow on Thursday night that Trump may have meant the latter. Regardless, Conway insisted during the heated exchange on MSNBC, the tweet did not necessarily represent a policy change, but Trump \u201ctalking about keeping us safe and secure.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cThere are a lot of people hiding under the bed right now because it doesn\u2019t seem like he knows what he\u2019s talking about on this issue,\u201d Maddow said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cThat\u2019s not fair,\u201d Conway responded, later adding, \u201cHe\u2019s not making policy on Twitter. \u2026 Again, perhaps he is also echoing what President Obama himself has tried to do here, which is get upgrades to our nuclear systems.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jason Miller, a Trump spokesman, had also said on Thursday that the president-elect was talking about expanding nonproliferation efforts, not stoking an arms race. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"President-elect Trump was referring to the threat of nuclear proliferation and the critical need to prevent it \u2014 particularly to and among terrorist organizations and unstable and rogue regimes,\" Miller said in a statement. \"He has also emphasized the need to improve and modernize our deterrent capability as a vital way to pursue peace through strength.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump\u2019s comments Friday, of course, seemed to directly contradict that. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The controversy started after Russian President Vladimir Putin called on his country to \u201cstrengthen\u201d its nuclear forces. \u201cWe need to strengthen the military potential of strategic nuclear forces, especially with missile complexes that can reliably penetrate any existing and prospective missile defense systems,\u201d he said earlier this week, according to multiple news reports. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But Putin at an annual news conference on Friday said Russia has no interest in a nuclear arms race and seemed to normalize Trump\u2019s statements, calling his tweet unsurprising. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cOf course the U.S. has more missiles, submarines and aircraft carriers, but what we say is that we are stronger than any aggressor, and this is the case,\u201d Putin said, adding, \u201cAs for Donald Trump, there is nothing new about it, during his elections campaign he said the U.S. needs to bolster its nuclear capabilities and its armed forces in general.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR During the election season, Trump made contradictory statements about nuclear proliferation. He suggested that some countries \u2014 including Japan, South Korea and Saudi Arabia \u2014 should be allowed to develop them, despite efforts to prevent more countries from doing so. But he also told The New York Times in March that \u201cit\u2019s a very scary nuclear world.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cBiggest problem, to me, in the world, is nuclear, and proliferation,\u201d Trump said at the time. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump\u2019s more recent comments about expanding America\u2019s nuclear capability go against decades of policy to reduce the stockpile of nuclear warheads and could potentially violate an arms control treaty with Russia. The U.S. has a stockpile of roughly 4,500 nuclear warheads and nearly 1,500 deployed warheads (Russia\u2019s armaments are nearly identical, as both nations account for more than 90 percent of the world\u2019s nuclear warheads). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The U.S. and Russia are due to meet nuclear reduction targets by February 2018 under the New START Treaty, which can be extended for another five years in 2021. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Experts remain confused and in some cases unnerved by the nature of Trump\u2019s foray into the nuclear weapons discussion. On Thursday, John Tierney, a former Democratic congressman and current executive director of the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation, presented Trump\u2019s tweet as perilous. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cIt is dangerous for the President-elect to use just 140 characters and announce a major change in U.S. nuclear weapons policy, which is nuanced, complex, and affects every single person on this planet,\u201d he said in a statement, warning that an expansion threatens a nuclear arms race. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cThe potential consequences of changing U.S. nuclear weapons policy so drastically are simply unimaginable,\u201d he warned. \u201cCurrent plans already call for spending $1 trillion over the next three decades to modernize and maintain the U.S. nuclear arsenal, which the Pentagon has expressed concern about being able to afford. The President-elect will have to explain why any increase is necessary both financially and strategically.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Joseph Cirincione, the president of the global security foundation Ploughshares Fund and a nuclear weapons expert, called Trump's actions \u201cbizarre, unprecedented and completely out of bounds behavior for a president-elect.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Incoming presidents usually wait until they take office to make pronouncements on a topic like nuclear policy, Cirincione said. Beyond that, he said he is alarmed by the cavalier attitude Trump seems to have toward as enormously sensitive an issue as weapons of mass destruction. While Trump might see Twitter as a means to convey strength to his constituents at home, Cirincione said, \u201cthe rest of the world is watching,\u201d and other countries could respond with actions of their own. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cYou can\u2019t use Twitter to make nuclear policy,\u201d Cirincione said. \u201cLook, you should at least wait until you\u2019re president. But this is why \u2014 this kind of view that he\u2019s breaking with convention, he wants to shake things up, I understand that, but not on nuclear policy. There are reasons why people spend days crafting the language of nuclear policy.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cThese things can be very complicated,\u201d he continued, \u201cand every word matters.\u201d\nPassage 2:\nThis is probably not the first day on the job that Sean Spicer imagined it would be. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Already he has done a merry-go-round of morning show appearances since it was announced Thursday that he will serve as our nation\u2019s next White House Press Secretary, set to take office with the Trump administration next month. However, his first day is off to an, uhh, let\u2019s call it interesting start; during an off-air conversation this morning with Mika Brzezinski of MSNBC, the President-elect surprisingly said of nuclear proliferation, \u201cLet it be an arms race, we will outmatch them at every pass.

And they pulled back, and then, you know, it\u2019s a, it was a terrible thing the way he announced that, and then he didn\u2019t leave troops behind so that, you know, whatever there was of Iraq, which in my opinion wasn\u2019t very much, because I think that, you know, the government was totally corrupt, and they put the wrong people in charge, and you know, that in its own way led to the formation of ISIS, because they weren\u2019t given their due. But, I think that President Obama, the way he got out of that war was unbelievable. I think Hillary Clinton was catastrophic in those decisions, having to do with Libya and just about everything else. Every bad decision that you could make in the Middle East was made. And now if you look at it, if you would go back 15 years ago, and I\u2019m not saying it was only Obama, It was Obama\u2019s getting out, it was other people\u2019s getting in, but you go back 15 years ago, and I say this, if our presidents would have just gone to the beach and enjoyed the ocean and the sun, we would\u2019ve been much better off in the Middle East, than all of this tremendous death, destruction, and you know, monetary loss, it\u2019s just incredible. \u2019Cause we\u2019re further, we\u2019re far worse off today than we were 15 years ago or 10 years ago in the Middle East. Far worse. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR SANGER: But I just want to make sure I understand your answer to Maggie\u2019s question. So you said earlier this week that we should use air power but not send in ground forces. That had to be done by the regional Arab partners. We assume by that, you mean the Saudis, the U.A.E. and others from whom we might purchase oil or have alliances. I think Maggie\u2019s question, if I understood it right, was if these countries are unwilling to send in ground troops against ISIS, and so far they have been, despite President Obama\u2019s efforts to get them in, would you be willing to say, \u201cWe will stop buying oil from you, until you send ground troops?\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR TRUMP: There\u2019s two answers to that. The answer is, probably yes, but I would also say this: We are not being reimbursed for our protection of many of the countries that you\u2019ll be talking about, that, including Saudi Arabia. You know, Saudi Arabia, for a period of time, now the oil has gone down, but still the numbers are phenomenal, and the amount of money they have is phenomenal. But we protect countries, and take tremendous monetary hits on protecting countries. That would include Saudi Arabia, but it would include many other countries, as you know. We have, there\u2019s a whole big list of them. We lose, everywhere. We lose monetarily, everywhere. And yet, without us, Saudi Arabia wouldn\u2019t exist for very long. It would be, you know, a catastrophic failure without our protection. And I\u2019m trying to figure out, why is it that we aren\u2019t going in and saying, at a minimum, at a minimum it\u2019s a two-part question, with respect to Maggie\u2019s question. But why aren\u2019t we going in and saying, \u201cAt a minimum, I\u2019m sorry folks, but you have to, under no circumstances can we continue to do this.\u201d You know, we needed, we needed oil desperately years ago. Today, because \u2013 again, because of the new technologies, and because of places that we never thought had oil, and they do have oil, and there\u2019s a glut on the market, there\u2019s a tremendous glut on the market, I mean you have ships out at sea that are loaded up and they don\u2019t even know where to go dump it. But we don\u2019t have that same pressure anymore, at all. And we shouldn\u2019t have that for a long period of time, because there\u2019s so many places. I mean, they\u2019re closing wells all over the place. So, I would say this, I would say at a minimum, we have to be reimbursed, substantially reimbursed, I mean, to a point that\u2019s far greater than what we\u2019re being paid right now. Because we\u2019re not being reimbursed for the kind of tremendous service that we\u2019re performing by protecting various countries. Now Saudi Arabia\u2019s one of them. I think if Saudi Arabia was without the cloak of American protection of our country\u2019s, of U.S. protection, think of Saudi Arabia. I don\u2019t think it would be around. It would be, whether it was internal or external, it wouldn\u2019t be around for very long. And they\u2019re a money machine, they\u2019re a monetary machine, and yet they don\u2019t reimburse us the way we should be reimbursed. So that\u2019s a real problem. And frankly, I think it\u2019s a real, in terms of bringing our country back, because our country\u2019s a poor country. Our country is a debtor nation, we\u2019re a debtor nation. I mean, we owe trillions of dollars to people that are buying our bonds, in the form of other countries. You look at China, where we owe them $1.7 trillion, you have Japan, $1.5 trillion. We\u2019re a debtor nation. We can\u2019t be a debtor nation. I don\u2019t want to be a debtor nation. I want it to be the other way. One of the reasons we\u2019re a debtor nation, we spend so much on the military, but the military isn\u2019t for us. The military is to be policeman for other countries. And to watch over other countries. And there comes a point that, and many of these countries are tremendously rich countries. Not powerful countries, but \u2013 in some cases they are powerful \u2013 but rich countries. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR SANGER: One more along the lines of your ISIS strategy. You\u2019ve seen the current strategy, which is, you\u2019ve seen Secretary Kerry trying to seek a political accord between President Assad and the rebel forces, with Assad eventually leaving. And then the hope is to turn all those forces, including Russia and Iran, against ISIS. Is that the right way to do it? Do you have an alternative approach? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR TRUMP: Well, I thought the approach of fighting Assad and ISIS simultaneously was madness, and idiocy. They\u2019re fighting each other and yet we\u2019re fighting both of them. You know, we were fighting both of them. I think that our far bigger problem than Assad is ISIS, I\u2019ve always felt that. Assad is, you know I\u2019m not saying Assad is a good man, \u2019cause he\u2019s not, but our far greater problem is not Assad, it\u2019s ISIS.\nPassage 4:\nA Russian Topol-M intercontinental ballistic missile with a range of some 11,000 kilometres (6,800 miles) and capable of carrying a warhead of up to one megaton, the equivalent of one million tons of TNT explosive (AFP Photo/DMITRY KOSTYUKOV) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Moscow (AFP) - Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday called for the country to reinforce its military nuclear potential and praised the army's performance in its Syria campaign. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In a speech that recapped military activities in 2016, Putin said the army's preparedness has \"considerably increased\" and called for continued improvement that would ensure it can \"neutralise any military threat\".

{"prompt": "You are given several news passages. Write a one-page summary of all news. \n\nNews:\nPassage 1:\ncable news news Keith Olbermann Has Reportedly Been Negotiating His Exit for a While NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After Keith Olbermann suddenly announced his departure last night, some speculated that the impending NBC-Comcast merger played a role. NBC executives quickly denied any Comcast involvement in the decision. But how did it all really go down? Details are trickling in, and early anonymous sources say Olbermann was not flat-out fired. However, most outlets are also reporting that Olbermann and network brass have long been butting heads. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR According to TMZ, the exit was partially about money: \"Olbermann's agent went to NBC complaining that Keith was underpaid,\" the site reports. \"NBC execs told Olbermann's agent they would not cough up more money. Network execs were well aware that Comcast wanted Keith gone because he was 'a loose cannon that could not be controlled.' It became clear to both sides that Olbermann's days were numbered and they began negotiating an exit, completed just before airtime Friday night.\" Under the deal, Olbermann is allegedly barred from appearing on television for a certain period of time, but he will reappear soon with \"a presence on the Internet,\" where all fugitives of the television end up. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Deadline reports a similar story: \"This was all Keith's choice. He has said several times over the years said that he wants out of his contract.\" The site says he began negotiating his out a few months ago, but, \"because of all the false threats in the past, it was impossible for the network to know if he was really going to sign the final document.\" Even his own staff learned he was quitting when they heard him say it on TV. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And the New York Times concurs that NBC and Olbermann have been in negotiations to end Olbermann's run for weeks. The Times notes: \"Mr. Olbermann had butted heads with his superiors long before the Comcast deal, including Phil Griffin, the top MSNBC executive ... and NBC\u2019s management had been close to firing Mr. Olbermann before.\" One executive said Comcast \"dreaded the prospect\" of being blamed if Olbermann were to quit soon after the takeover. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Only the New York Post reported that Olberamnn was \"unceremoniously dumped,\" but the paper also repeatedly refers to him as \"a garrulous gasbag.\" So.\nPassage 2:\nThe ball was chopped slowly and to get the out the first baseman would have to pick it up barehanded in the grass corner between the foul line and the infield dirt. The pitcher would have to hustle over but as the game\u2019s most abused cliche reminds us every 43 minutes, that\u2019s why they have PFP in spring training. With a speedy runner it would still be close but this was the majors and he who executes best laughs last. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The fans at Yankee Stadium didn\u2019t think twice about it when it happened in the top of the fourth yesterday. The play was difficult, but the pitcher was CC Sabathia and his hustle and athleticism have been one of the under-publicized aspects of the franchise\u2019s success since 2009. And of course, the New York first baseman for exactly the same length of time has been Mark Teixeira and the goaltender-like whip-lash catches he makes at the bag and his other defensive wizardry obscures the fact that if that comparatively ordinary slow chopper is hit to him 500 times over a decade he\u2019s going to pick it cleanly at least 499 times. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Except the Yankee first baseman yesterday wasn\u2019t Teixeira, it was Kevin Youkilis. And no offense to Kevin Youkilis, but when he reached down to scoop up the Jose Iglesias chop and toss it to Sabathia for the out he got nothing but grass and air. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR An inning later Jarrod Saltalamacchia shot one into the corner in left, where Brett Gardner should have made an adroit pick-up of the ball as it rattled around. Except Gardner was in center because like Teixeira, Curtis Granderson is hurt and it was Vernon Wells. And no offense to Vernon Wells, but when he waited for the straight bounce off the fence that never comes out there, it didn\u2019t come, and he was left to play \u2018go chase\u2019 for awhile. All things considered Saltalamacchia probably would\u2019ve gotten a double out of it anyway but there would have been a play and every tenth or twentieth time \u2013 an out. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In neither case did the Red Sox score. But those two plays alone added ten pitches or more to Sabathia\u2019s count and send him packing after five innings down 4-to-2, which opened things for the Yankee bullpen, which may be the least recognized problem among the cascade of them that started yesterday, and soon it would 5-to-2 and then 8-to-2 and then just as in \u201cYoung Frankenstein,\u201d it got worse \u2013 it started raining. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The effect on the offense of the subtraction of Teixeira, Granderson, Derek Jeter, and even Alex Rodriguez is obvious. What will kill the Yankees \u2013 and I mean last place kill the Yankees; this is not the collapse of 1965, that was last year in the ALCS, this is 1966 \u2013 will be its effect on the defense. Bad defense is not only its own punishment but it makes bums out of the best of the pitchers. And to re-use yet another old joke, kid, these aren\u2019t the best of them. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And much of this mess will never show up in the box score. The Iglesias and Saltalamacchia plays were both clearly to be scored base hits. Unfortunately this Yankee team \u2013 the Muddlers\u2019 Row of Brennan Boesch, Ben Francisco, Travis Hafner, Lyle Overbay, Wells, and Youkilis \u2013 has been assembled through (in the memorable phrase of the equally memorable San Francisco baseball writer Hank Schulman) dumpster-diving. And defensively they\u2019re just bad enough to not make the plays, but just good enough to not get the errors. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It\u2019s hard to say how this impending disaster will be received in the Bronx. The Yankees haven\u2019t had a losing season since 1992 and they\u2019ve either won or been in contention every year since 1993. Hal Steinbrenner was still at the University of Florida Business School then, and the Yankees could and often did draw half of what they draw these days. A front office with no memory of the Bad Old Days never mind experience with alleviating them is likely to panic and throw some babies out with the bathwater (heck, the Yankees began panicking about mild media criticism more than a year ago). And the front-running fans who have filled the place during these later glory years will not know what that they were seeing, and never fully realize the implications of the fact that their new platoon third baseman was guy who had been released by the Red Sox exactly a week ago today. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Toronto: I\u2019m not one of those stick-in-the-muds who looked at the Dodgers last year and tut-tutted \u201cyou can\u2019t parachute in four new guys in mid-season and expect to form a team.\u201d I mean, for one thing I\u2019m an entirely different kind of stick-in-the-mud. But more importantly, that conclusion ignores the reality that the Giants have won two World Series while parachuting in four guys (last year) and five guys (2010). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR So my refusal to jump on the Bandwagon going doing Blue Jay Way is nothing about team chemistry or parachuting or trying to meld a team while competing or Jose Reyes\u2019s hamstrings on turf. I just think that the laudable effort to rebuild a once-great franchise has somewhat obscured some remaining problems \u2013 like a very average bullpen, very average production out of the DH spot, and trouble at third base until Brett Lawrie returns. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Plus there\u2019s this little scandal from last year that sneaked in under everybody\u2019s radar. The big trade for the noble Cy Young Award winner R.A. Dickey? It came less than a year after Dickey became one of a handful of major league pitchers to admit to taking painkiller injections during the season (Jonathan Papelbon, Jon Lester, and Clay Buchholz were among the others). In Dickey\u2019s case this was 2011; I\u2019ve seen no reporting about him and the drug \u2013 Toradol \u2013 in 2012: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Dickey is among the players who believe Toradol is more effective than taking over-the-counter pain pills. He said he believed the injections helped keep him on the field to pitch 2082/3 innings last season (2011), despite his injured foot. Some doctors, though, said athletes might believe Toradol to be more effective only because of the way it is commonly administered. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The emphasis there was mine. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Giving your starting pitcher a series of anti-inflammatory pain-dulling injections all seasons long is ok because the drug, while requiring a prescription, supposedly only has a slightly greater impact than a couple of Advil (injected directly into the source of your pain). Except, oh by the way, that pesky drug insert sheet references limiting its use to five days in pill form and two days for injections, and oh by the way in England physicians are instructed to start patients on Toradol only in a hospital, and oh by the way when Clay Buchholz was in a hospital with internal bleeding last June he said he thought his use of the drug contributed to his crisis and the fact that doctors had to transfuse him with three or four pints of blood. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Dickey is hardly deserving of being the only one with a finger pointed at him. My understanding is there isn\u2019t a rotation in the majors that doesn\u2019t have at least one regular Toradol, and that some of them may be in new uniforms this year in part because of their teams\u2019 fears that the painkiller could mask necessary pain, the kind that warns you of impending injury. For as with any drug that dulls pain, or covers up muscular damage or exhaustion, or which neutralizes tiredness, the possibility is increased of sudden serious injury. You don\u2019t know you\u2019re hurting and you push it to far \u2013 and something snaps. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In short, if a Toradol scandal, or a Prescription Drug scandal, breaks in baseball this year the guys on the record as (past) users are few and far between. And only one of them is a defending Cy Young Winner. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Almost as an aside I also have doubts about the efficacy of Toronto\u2019s rotation. Dickey went from 8-13 in 2011 to 20-6 last year. His strikeouts soared from 134 to 230 in only 25 more innings. His offensive support went up 8/10ths of a run. I don\u2019t know if any of that is sustainable or repeatable this year \u2013 especially without the joy of facing pitchers every ninth batter. Tell me how much you\u2019re willing to rely on Mark Buehrle and Josh Johnson, to say nothing of Ricky Romero, currently of the Dunedin Blue Jays. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Boston: The gift of Jackie Bradley being ready as much as a year early \u2013 and it is a gift, his at bats are those of a 10-year veteran who draws 100 walks every year \u2013 may hide some dubious free agent signings. When your key acquisition does so poorly on his physical that you (and he) agree to cut the deal from three years to one, that\u2019s a problem. When you are hoping that Jonny Gomes, Shane Victorino, and Ryan Dempster all had \u2018blips\u2019 last year, that\u2019s a lot of high-odds wagering. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Red Sox probably did themselves a favor by sacrificing the stability that was Adrian Gonzalez in order to offload the franchise-sinking contracts of Josh Beckett and Carl Crawford. But as has been noted elsewhere, they were left with a lot of contract room and not that many people to spend it on. Instead of a Josh Hamilton they went for \u201cClubhouse Guys\u201d \u2013 which is great for long road trips, flights, bus rides in traffic, rain delays, etc. \u2013 but rarely seems to be the corrective folks assume insomuch as the last time I checked the game was still played out on the field and very rarely in the clubhouse. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Bradley, of course, is the real deal (though I\u2019ve never seen a player whose Dad didn\u2019t reach the majors use the \u201cjunior\u201d on his uni \u2013 his reads \u201cBRADLEY JR.\u201d). Will Middlebrooks is legit too. If Jacoby Ellsbury and Dustin Pedroia stay healthy that\u2019s four of nine positions that will excel offensively and defensively. But with David Ortiz hurt and presumably waning there is no longer a feared hitter in this line-up and given the depth of this division that\u2019s a serious impediment to contention. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Baltimore: As mentioned in the AL Central preview the Orioles could\u2019ve easily offed the Yankees in the ALDS last year even though they were relying on two outfielders \u2013 Lew Ford and Nate McLouth \u2013 who had been released earlier in the same season (Ford, by a team in an independent league). The O\u2019s were reshaped by two guys who were largely viewed as having been bypassed by the proverbial parade, Buck Showalter and Dan Duquette, and featured the contributions of only a couple of homegrown guys (Markakis, Machado, Wieters, Jim Johnson). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR What becomes of the Orioles when the revivified farm system begins to contribute? Dylan Bundy was arguably the game\u2019s top pitching prospect, until this spring when he was bypassed by his teammate Kevin Gausman. Will they step into the rotation or be used out of the bullpen a la David Price? Could WBC-tested infielder Jonathan Schoop help out? Or outfielder L.J. Hoes? Could any American League team add more key parts from its own farm system as 2013 rolls along? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Tampa Bay: Well, yeah, actually. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Even while trading off Wade Davis and James Shields, the Rays still have a complete back-up rotation (Jeff Niemann in the bullpen, Chris Archer, Jake Odorizzi, Mike Montgomery, and Alex Colome in the minors) to say nothing of a Cy Young Winner (David Price) and two possible future candidates (Jeremy Hellickson and Matt Moore) at the front of Plan A. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And if the primary bounty in the Shields trade, Wil Myers, is not summoned into the Tampa line-up it will only be because of injury, or because the traditional small-ball line-up is producing satisfactorily and there\u2019s no need to squeeze out James Loney or the platooners at second or DH. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The key Tampa weakness would seem to be behind the plate. They kept Jose Molina intact enough to appear in 102 games last year and one wonders if that can be done again, or if Jose Lobaton is a satisfactory alternative. There isn\u2019t a catching prospect in the system and despite the sense that the Rays hit the bullseye with every one of their very few economic darts, the minors are thin generally in terms of position players (2009 was a bad draft, and every year that passes makes the 2008 selection of Tim Beckham as the overall number one pick instead of some kid named Posey look that much sillier). But the arms keep appearing, the down-market free agent signings keep producing (you realize that Loney could out-hit his predecessor Carlos Pena by a hundred points and still not hit .300?), and the veterans get transformed either into more draft choices (or guys like Wil Myers. Good grief, the team with the thinnest tightrope in the sport was somehow able to trade for Wil Myers). Marc Topkin has a superb and concise explanation of how the Rays keep the machine turning here and I offer the usual disclaimer here that I went to college with the future Mrs. Stuart Sternberg and their oldest son was an intern for me one summer. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Division: I know this is viewed as a three, four, or even five team race. I just don\u2019t see anybody seriously challenging the Rays, especially when Myers comes up. I\u2019m not certain on whether the Orioles\u2019 Tampa-like structuring and youth flood can overcome the value of Toronto\u2019s mass additions in the race for second place; either way it\u2019ll be close. The Red Sox are not likely to compete but also not likely to be challenged by the Yankees who \u2013 even in the disaster of last place \u2013 will still be the division\u2019s lead story. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Tomorrow we\u2019ll finish it up with the Tarot Card reading that those one-game wild cards make trying to predict the playoffs six months in advance.\nPassage 3:\nKeith Olbermann -- The Rich Get Richer NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Keith Olbermann -- The Rich Get Richer NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR scored an even sweeter exit package than previously reported. Sources connected with NBC tell us Keith is pocketing \"well in excess\" of $7 million.Sources tell us ... Olbermann was due for two salary hikes during the last two years of his contract, which would have netted him just over $17 million. The exit deal, we're told, gives Keith much more than $7 million, though our sources would not be more specific.And we're told ...

NBC executives quickly denied any Comcast involvement in the decision. But how did it all really go down? Details are trickling in, and early anonymous sources say Olbermann was not flat-out fired. However, most outlets are also reporting that Olbermann and network brass have long been butting heads. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR According to TMZ, the exit was partially about money: \"Olbermann's agent went to NBC complaining that Keith was underpaid,\" the site reports. \"NBC execs told Olbermann's agent they would not cough up more money. Network execs were well aware that Comcast wanted Keith gone because he was 'a loose cannon that could not be controlled.' It became clear to both sides that Olbermann's days were numbered and they began negotiating an exit, completed just before airtime Friday night.\" Under the deal, Olbermann is allegedly barred from appearing on television for a certain period of time, but he will reappear soon with \"a presence on the Internet,\" where all fugitives of the television end up. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Deadline reports a similar story: \"This was all Keith's choice. He has said several times over the years said that he wants out of his contract.\" The site says he began negotiating his out a few months ago, but, \"because of all the false threats in the past, it was impossible for the network to know if he was really going to sign the final document.\" Even his own staff learned he was quitting when they heard him say it on TV. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And the New York Times concurs that NBC and Olbermann have been in negotiations to end Olbermann's run for weeks. The Times notes: \"Mr. Olbermann had butted heads with his superiors long before the Comcast deal, including Phil Griffin, the top MSNBC executive ... and NBC\u2019s management had been close to firing Mr. Olbermann before.\" One executive said Comcast \"dreaded the prospect\" of being blamed if Olbermann were to quit soon after the takeover. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Only the New York Post reported that Olberamnn was \"unceremoniously dumped,\" but the paper also repeatedly refers to him as \"a garrulous gasbag.\" So.\nPassage 2:\nThe ball was chopped slowly and to get the out the first baseman would have to pick it up barehanded in the grass corner between the foul line and the infield dirt. The pitcher would have to hustle over but as the game\u2019s most abused cliche reminds us every 43 minutes, that\u2019s why they have PFP in spring training. With a speedy runner it would still be close but this was the majors and he who executes best laughs last. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The fans at Yankee Stadium didn\u2019t think twice about it when it happened in the top of the fourth yesterday. The play was difficult, but the pitcher was CC Sabathia and his hustle and athleticism have been one of the under-publicized aspects of the franchise\u2019s success since 2009. And of course, the New York first baseman for exactly the same length of time has been Mark Teixeira and the goaltender-like whip-lash catches he makes at the bag and his other defensive wizardry obscures the fact that if that comparatively ordinary slow chopper is hit to him 500 times over a decade he\u2019s going to pick it cleanly at least 499 times. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Except the Yankee first baseman yesterday wasn\u2019t Teixeira, it was Kevin Youkilis. And no offense to Kevin Youkilis, but when he reached down to scoop up the Jose Iglesias chop and toss it to Sabathia for the out he got nothing but grass and air. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR An inning later Jarrod Saltalamacchia shot one into the corner in left, where Brett Gardner should have made an adroit pick-up of the ball as it rattled around. Except Gardner was in center because like Teixeira, Curtis Granderson is hurt and it was Vernon Wells. And no offense to Vernon Wells, but when he waited for the straight bounce off the fence that never comes out there, it didn\u2019t come, and he was left to play \u2018go chase\u2019 for awhile. All things considered Saltalamacchia probably would\u2019ve gotten a double out of it anyway but there would have been a play and every tenth or twentieth time \u2013 an out. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In neither case did the Red Sox score. But those two plays alone added ten pitches or more to Sabathia\u2019s count and send him packing after five innings down 4-to-2, which opened things for the Yankee bullpen, which may be the least recognized problem among the cascade of them that started yesterday, and soon it would 5-to-2 and then 8-to-2 and then just as in \u201cYoung Frankenstein,\u201d it got worse \u2013 it started raining. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The effect on the offense of the subtraction of Teixeira, Granderson, Derek Jeter, and even Alex Rodriguez is obvious. What will kill the Yankees \u2013 and I mean last place kill the Yankees; this is not the collapse of 1965, that was last year in the ALCS, this is 1966 \u2013 will be its effect on the defense. Bad defense is not only its own punishment but it makes bums out of the best of the pitchers. And to re-use yet another old joke, kid, these aren\u2019t the best of them. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And much of this mess will never show up in the box score. The Iglesias and Saltalamacchia plays were both clearly to be scored base hits. Unfortunately this Yankee team \u2013 the Muddlers\u2019 Row of Brennan Boesch, Ben Francisco, Travis Hafner, Lyle Overbay, Wells, and Youkilis \u2013 has been assembled through (in the memorable phrase of the equally memorable San Francisco baseball writer Hank Schulman) dumpster-diving. And defensively they\u2019re just bad enough to not make the plays, but just good enough to not get the errors. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It\u2019s hard to say how this impending disaster will be received in the Bronx. The Yankees haven\u2019t had a losing season since 1992 and they\u2019ve either won or been in contention every year since 1993. Hal Steinbrenner was still at the University of Florida Business School then, and the Yankees could and often did draw half of what they draw these days. A front office with no memory of the Bad Old Days never mind experience with alleviating them is likely to panic and throw some babies out with the bathwater (heck, the Yankees began panicking about mild media criticism more than a year ago). And the front-running fans who have filled the place during these later glory years will not know what that they were seeing, and never fully realize the implications of the fact that their new platoon third baseman was guy who had been released by the Red Sox exactly a week ago today. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Toronto: I\u2019m not one of those stick-in-the-muds who looked at the Dodgers last year and tut-tutted \u201cyou can\u2019t parachute in four new guys in mid-season and expect to form a team.\u201d I mean, for one thing I\u2019m an entirely different kind of stick-in-the-mud. But more importantly, that conclusion ignores the reality that the Giants have won two World Series while parachuting in four guys (last year) and five guys (2010). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR So my refusal to jump on the Bandwagon going doing Blue Jay Way is nothing about team chemistry or parachuting or trying to meld a team while competing or Jose Reyes\u2019s hamstrings on turf. I just think that the laudable effort to rebuild a once-great franchise has somewhat obscured some remaining problems \u2013 like a very average bullpen, very average production out of the DH spot, and trouble at third base until Brett Lawrie returns. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Plus there\u2019s this little scandal from last year that sneaked in under everybody\u2019s radar. The big trade for the noble Cy Young Award winner R.A. Dickey? It came less than a year after Dickey became one of a handful of major league pitchers to admit to taking painkiller injections during the season (Jonathan Papelbon, Jon Lester, and Clay Buchholz were among the others). In Dickey\u2019s case this was 2011; I\u2019ve seen no reporting about him and the drug \u2013 Toradol \u2013 in 2012: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Dickey is among the players who believe Toradol is more effective than taking over-the-counter pain pills. He said he believed the injections helped keep him on the field to pitch 2082/3 innings last season (2011), despite his injured foot. Some doctors, though, said athletes might believe Toradol to be more effective only because of the way it is commonly administered. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The emphasis there was mine. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Giving your starting pitcher a series of anti-inflammatory pain-dulling injections all seasons long is ok because the drug, while requiring a prescription, supposedly only has a slightly greater impact than a couple of Advil (injected directly into the source of your pain). Except, oh by the way, that pesky drug insert sheet references limiting its use to five days in pill form and two days for injections, and oh by the way in England physicians are instructed to start patients on Toradol only in a hospital, and oh by the way when Clay Buchholz was in a hospital with internal bleeding last June he said he thought his use of the drug contributed to his crisis and the fact that doctors had to transfuse him with three or four pints of blood. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Dickey is hardly deserving of being the only one with a finger pointed at him. My understanding is there isn\u2019t a rotation in the majors that doesn\u2019t have at least one regular Toradol, and that some of them may be in new uniforms this year in part because of their teams\u2019 fears that the painkiller could mask necessary pain, the kind that warns you of impending injury. For as with any drug that dulls pain, or covers up muscular damage or exhaustion, or which neutralizes tiredness, the possibility is increased of sudden serious injury. You don\u2019t know you\u2019re hurting and you push it to far \u2013 and something snaps. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In short, if a Toradol scandal, or a Prescription Drug scandal, breaks in baseball this year the guys on the record as (past) users are few and far between. And only one of them is a defending Cy Young Winner. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Almost as an aside I also have doubts about the efficacy of Toronto\u2019s rotation. Dickey went from 8-13 in 2011 to 20-6 last year. His strikeouts soared from 134 to 230 in only 25 more innings. His offensive support went up 8/10ths of a run. I don\u2019t know if any of that is sustainable or repeatable this year \u2013 especially without the joy of facing pitchers every ninth batter. Tell me how much you\u2019re willing to rely on Mark Buehrle and Josh Johnson, to say nothing of Ricky Romero, currently of the Dunedin Blue Jays. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Boston: The gift of Jackie Bradley being ready as much as a year early \u2013 and it is a gift, his at bats are those of a 10-year veteran who draws 100 walks every year \u2013 may hide some dubious free agent signings. When your key acquisition does so poorly on his physical that you (and he) agree to cut the deal from three years to one, that\u2019s a problem. When you are hoping that Jonny Gomes, Shane Victorino, and Ryan Dempster all had \u2018blips\u2019 last year, that\u2019s a lot of high-odds wagering. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Red Sox probably did themselves a favor by sacrificing the stability that was Adrian Gonzalez in order to offload the franchise-sinking contracts of Josh Beckett and Carl Crawford. But as has been noted elsewhere, they were left with a lot of contract room and not that many people to spend it on. Instead of a Josh Hamilton they went for \u201cClubhouse Guys\u201d \u2013 which is great for long road trips, flights, bus rides in traffic, rain delays, etc. \u2013 but rarely seems to be the corrective folks assume insomuch as the last time I checked the game was still played out on the field and very rarely in the clubhouse. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Bradley, of course, is the real deal (though I\u2019ve never seen a player whose Dad didn\u2019t reach the majors use the \u201cjunior\u201d on his uni \u2013 his reads \u201cBRADLEY JR.\u201d). Will Middlebrooks is legit too. If Jacoby Ellsbury and Dustin Pedroia stay healthy that\u2019s four of nine positions that will excel offensively and defensively. But with David Ortiz hurt and presumably waning there is no longer a feared hitter in this line-up and given the depth of this division that\u2019s a serious impediment to contention. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Baltimore: As mentioned in the AL Central preview the Orioles could\u2019ve easily offed the Yankees in the ALDS last year even though they were relying on two outfielders \u2013 Lew Ford and Nate McLouth \u2013 who had been released earlier in the same season (Ford, by a team in an independent league). The O\u2019s were reshaped by two guys who were largely viewed as having been bypassed by the proverbial parade, Buck Showalter and Dan Duquette, and featured the contributions of only a couple of homegrown guys (Markakis, Machado, Wieters, Jim Johnson). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR What becomes of the Orioles when the revivified farm system begins to contribute? Dylan Bundy was arguably the game\u2019s top pitching prospect, until this spring when he was bypassed by his teammate Kevin Gausman. Will they step into the rotation or be used out of the bullpen a la David Price? Could WBC-tested infielder Jonathan Schoop help out? Or outfielder L.J. Hoes? Could any American League team add more key parts from its own farm system as 2013 rolls along? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Tampa Bay: Well, yeah, actually. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Even while trading off Wade Davis and James Shields, the Rays still have a complete back-up rotation (Jeff Niemann in the bullpen, Chris Archer, Jake Odorizzi, Mike Montgomery, and Alex Colome in the minors) to say nothing of a Cy Young Winner (David Price) and two possible future candidates (Jeremy Hellickson and Matt Moore) at the front of Plan A. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And if the primary bounty in the Shields trade, Wil Myers, is not summoned into the Tampa line-up it will only be because of injury, or because the traditional small-ball line-up is producing satisfactorily and there\u2019s no need to squeeze out James Loney or the platooners at second or DH. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The key Tampa weakness would seem to be behind the plate. They kept Jose Molina intact enough to appear in 102 games last year and one wonders if that can be done again, or if Jose Lobaton is a satisfactory alternative. There isn\u2019t a catching prospect in the system and despite the sense that the Rays hit the bullseye with every one of their very few economic darts, the minors are thin generally in terms of position players (2009 was a bad draft, and every year that passes makes the 2008 selection of Tim Beckham as the overall number one pick instead of some kid named Posey look that much sillier). But the arms keep appearing, the down-market free agent signings keep producing (you realize that Loney could out-hit his predecessor Carlos Pena by a hundred points and still not hit .300?), and the veterans get transformed either into more draft choices (or guys like Wil Myers. Good grief, the team with the thinnest tightrope in the sport was somehow able to trade for Wil Myers). Marc Topkin has a superb and concise explanation of how the Rays keep the machine turning here and I offer the usual disclaimer here that I went to college with the future Mrs. Stuart Sternberg and their oldest son was an intern for me one summer. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Division: I know this is viewed as a three, four, or even five team race. I just don\u2019t see anybody seriously challenging the Rays, especially when Myers comes up. I\u2019m not certain on whether the Orioles\u2019 Tampa-like structuring and youth flood can overcome the value of Toronto\u2019s mass additions in the race for second place; either way it\u2019ll be close. The Red Sox are not likely to compete but also not likely to be challenged by the Yankees who \u2013 even in the disaster of last place \u2013 will still be the division\u2019s lead story. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Tomorrow we\u2019ll finish it up with the Tarot Card reading that those one-game wild cards make trying to predict the playoffs six months in advance.\nPassage 3:\nKeith Olbermann -- The Rich Get Richer NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Keith Olbermann -- The Rich Get Richer NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR scored an even sweeter exit package than previously reported.

Write a one-page summary of all news. \n\nNews:\nPassage 1:\nBALTIMORE, June 2 (UPI) -- A discrepancy between galactic distances in the infant universe and more modern measurements suggests the universe is expanding at a faster pace than previously predicted. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Astronomers recently used the Hubble Space Telescope to measure the distance between 19 galaxies with unprecedented accuracy. The numbers suggest the universe is expanding between 5 and 9 percent faster than the rate derived from galactic distances measured in the early universe, just after the Big Bang. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Researchers believe the discrepancy may offer insights into the nature of dark matter. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"This surprising finding may be an important clue to understanding those mysterious parts of the universe that make up 95 percent of everything and don't emit light, such as dark energy, dark matter, and dark radiation,\" Adam Riess, an astronomer with the Space Telescope Science Institute and Johns Hopkins University, said in a news release. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Dark matter and the dark energy it carries may explain the acceleration of the universe's expansion. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The most recent calculation of the universe's rate of expansion, called the Hubble constant, is believed to be the most accurate ever -- with a margin of error, or rate of uncertainty, of just 2.4 percent. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Astronomers expected the new calculations to forge an agreeable link with those derived from observations of the Big Bang afterglow collected by NASA's Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe and the European Space Agency's Planck satellite. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"You start at two ends, and you expect to meet in the middle if all of your drawings are right and your measurements are right,\" Reiss said. \"But now the ends are not quite meeting in the middle and we want to know why.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Astronomers are continuing to go over the data to try to reduce the margin for error even further, but it appears likely researchers will now be faced with the task of explaining the disagreement between the two Hubble constants.\nPassage 2:\nThe universe is expanding at an accelerating rate. This is a generally accepted scientific understanding, the discovery of which yielded a Nobel prize in 2011. But what exactly is the speed of that expansion? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR According to new research, soon to be published in the Astrophysical Journal, the rate of expansion, or the Hubble constant, is about 73.24 kilometers per second per megaparsec (a unit equivalent to 3.26 million light-years): somewhere between five and nine percent faster than we thought. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A multitude of reasons has been put forth for this discrepancy, including the possibility that these new calculations are inaccurate. But if they continue to withstand scrutiny, they could challenge some of the basic precepts surrounding the functioning of our universe. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"If you really believe our number \u2013 and we have shed blood, sweat and tears to get our measurement right and to accurately understand the uncertainties \u2013 then it leads to the conclusion that there is a problem with predictions based on measurements of the cosmic microwave background radiation, the leftover glow from the Big Bang,\" co-author Alex Filippenko, an astronomy professor at the University of California, Berkeley, said in a press release. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Maybe the universe is tricking us, or our understanding of the universe isn't complete,\" he added. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If the science is correct, then one possible explanation has to do with the mere 95 percent of the universe constituted of mysterious elements that do not emit light, such as dark matter, dark energy, and dark radiation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Dark energy, thought to be responsible for the acceleration of our expanding universe, could be pushing galaxies apart with even greater vigor than scientists believed. Or dark matter, the \"backbone of the universe,\" in NASA's words, could have some as-yet undiscovered oddities. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And then there's dark radiation: subatomic particles that travel at velocities approaching the speed of light. Maybe one such particle exists, or existed, that is unknown to science, perhaps the much-hypothesized \"fourth flavor of neutrino.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Aside from all that darkness, there is another possible explanation: Einstein's theory of relativity could be inaccurate. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"You start at two ends, and you expect to meet in the middle if all of your drawings are right and your measurements are right,\" study leader and Nobel Laureate Adam Riess, an astrophysicist at Johns Hopkins University and the Space Telescope Science Institute, said in a NASA press release. \"But now the ends are not quite meeting in the middle and we want to know why.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The new numbers are based upon the team's efforts to acquire a more precise understanding of the universe's current expansion rate. Using data from the Hubble Space Telescope and Hawaii's Keck I telescope, they refined that to an uncertainty of only 2.4 percent. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The new data were gleaned by analyzing two types of star: Cepheids and Type la supernovae. Cepheid stars allow astronomers to determine how far they are from us, and thereby how distant their galaxy is, by analyzing two characteristics: their true brightness, gleaned from the rate at which they pulsate, versus their apparent brightness as seen from Earth. Type la supernovae, a kind of exploding star, can be detected even further away. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The researchers measured about 2,400 Cepheid stars occupying 19 nearby galaxies, compared the apparent brightness of both types of star, and were able to determine the true brightness of the Type la supernovae. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Armed with this information, they could calculate the distance to some 300 Type la supernovae in distant galaxies. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We've done the world's best job of decreasing the uncertainty in the measured rate of universal expansion and of accurately assessing the size of this uncertainty,\" Dr. Filippenko said in the Berkeley release, \"yet we find that our measured rate of expansion is probably incompatible with the rate expected from observations of the young universe, suggesting that there's something important missing in our physical understanding of the universe.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Get the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It's far too early to jump up and down to say the universe is messing with us,\" Dr. Carroll told The Washington Post, but he conceded that the research was carried out by scientists both solid and careful.\nPassage 3:\nAstronomers using NASA's Hubble Space Telescope have discovered that the universe is expanding 5 percent to 9 percent faster than expected. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"This surprising finding may be an important clue to understanding those mysterious parts of the universe that make up 95 percent of everything and don't emit light, such as dark energy, dark matter, and dark radiation,\" said study leader and Nobel Laureate Adam Riess of the Space Telescope Science Institute and The Johns Hopkins University, both in Baltimore, Maryland. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The results will appear in an upcoming issue of The Astrophysical Journal. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Riess' team made the discovery by refining the universe's current expansion rate to unprecedented accuracy, reducing the uncertainty to only 2.4 percent. The team made the refinements by developing innovative techniques that improved the precision of distance measurements to faraway galaxies. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The team looked for galaxies containing both Cepheid stars and Type Ia supernovae. Cepheid stars pulsate at rates that correspond to their true brightness, which can be compared with their apparent brightness as seen from Earth to accurately determine their distance. Type Ia supernovae, another commonly used cosmic yardstick, are exploding stars that flare with the same brightness and are brilliant enough to be seen from relatively longer distances. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR By measuring about 2,400 Cepheid stars in 19 galaxies and comparing the observed brightness of both types of stars, the accurately measured their true brightness and calculated distances to roughly 300 Type Ia supernovae in far-flung galaxies. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The team compared those distances with the expansion of space as measured by the stretching of light from receding galaxies. They used these two values to calculate how fast the universe expands with time, or the Hubble constant. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The improved Hubble constant value is 73.2 kilometers per second per megaparsec. (A megaparsec equals 3.26 million light-years.) The new value means the distance between cosmic objects will double in another 9.8 billion years. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This refined calibration presents a puzzle, however, because it does not quite match the expansion rate predicted for the universe from its trajectory seen shortly after the Big Bang. Measurements of the afterglow from the Big Bang by NASA's Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) and the European Space Agency's Planck satellite mission yield predictions which are 5 percent and 9 percent smaller for the Hubble constant, respectively. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"If we know the initial amounts of stuff in the universe, such as dark energy and dark matter, and we have the physics correct, then you can go from a measurement at the time shortly after the big bang and use that understanding to predict how fast the universe should be expanding today,\" said Riess. \"However, if this discrepancy holds up, it appears we may not have the right understanding, and it changes how big the Hubble constant should be today.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Comparing the universe's expansion rate with WMAP, Planck, and Hubble is like building a bridge, Riess explained. On the distant shore are the cosmic microwave background observations of the early universe. On the nearby shore are the measurements made by Riess' team using Hubble. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"You start at two ends, and you expect to meet in the middle if all of your drawings are right and your measurements are right,\" Riess said. \"But now the ends are not quite meeting in the middle and we want to know why.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There are a few possible explanations for the universe's excessive speed. One possibility is that dark energy, already known to be accelerating the universe, may be shoving galaxies away from each other with even greater -- or growing -- strength. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Another idea is that the cosmos contained a new subatomic particle in its early history that traveled close to the speed of light. Such speedy particles are collectively referred to as \"dark radiation\" and include previously known particles like neutrinos. More energy from additional dark radiation could be throwing off the best efforts to predict today's expansion rate from its post-big bang trajectory. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The boost in acceleration could also mean that dark matter possesses some weird, unexpected characteristics. Dark matter is the backbone of the universe upon which galaxies built themselves up into the large-scale structures seen today. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And finally, the speedier universe may be telling astronomers that Einstein's theory of gravity is incomplete. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We know so little about the dark parts of the universe, it's important to measure how they push and pull on space over cosmic history,\" said Lucas Macri of Texas A&M; University in College Station, a key collaborator on the study. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Hubble observations were made with Hubble's sharp-eyed Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3), and were conducted by the Supernova H0 for the Equation of State (SH0ES) team, which works to refine the accuracy of the Hubble constant to a precision that allows for a better understanding of the universe's behavior. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The SH0ES Team is still using Hubble to reduce the uncertainty in the Hubble constant even more, with a goal to reach an accuracy of 1 percent. Current telescopes such as the European Space Agency's Gaia satellite, and future telescopes such as the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), an infrared observatory, and the Wide Field Infrared Space Telescope (WFIRST), also could help astronomers make better measurements of the expansion rate. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Before Hubble was launched in 1990, the estimates of the Hubble constant varied by a factor of two. In the late 1990s the Hubble Space Telescope Key Project on the Extragalactic Distance Scale refined the value of the Hubble constant to within an error of only 10 percent, accomplishing one of the telescope's key goals. The SH0ES team has reduced the uncertainty in the Hubble constant value by 76 percent since beginning its quest in 2005. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ### NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Hubble Space Telescope is a project of international cooperation between NASA and the European Space Agency. NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, manages the telescope. The Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) in Baltimore, Maryland, conducts Hubble science operations. STScI is operated for NASA by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy in Washington, D.C.

This is a discovery that could test part of Albert Einstein\u2019s theory of relativity, a pillar of cosmology that has withstood challenges for a century. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Nasa and the European Space Agency jointly announced the universe is expanding 5% to 9% faster than predicted, a finding they reached after using the Hubble space telescope to measure the distance to stars in 19 galaxies beyond theMilky Way. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The rate of expansion did not match predictions based on measurements of radiation left over from the Big Bang that gave rise to the known universe 13.8bn years ago. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Milky weigh: our galaxy has the mass of 700bn suns, say scientists Read more NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Physicist and lead author Adam Riess said: \u201cYou start at two ends, and you expect to meet in the middle if all of your drawings are right and your measurements are right. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cBut now the ends are not quite meeting in the middle and we want to know why.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The researchers arrived at a new expansion rate of 73.2 kilometres per second per megaparsec. A megaparsec is 3.26 million light years. The consequence of this adjustment in difficult-to-imagine speeds over unthinkable distances is that the distance between cosmic objects will double in another 9.8 billion years. The catch is that such speeds do not match predictions for an expansion rate from other observations made by Nasa\u2019s Wilkinson microwave anisotropy Probe, or the European Space Agency\u2019s Planck satellite. Both went into orbit to study the afterglow of the Big Bang, in which time, space and matter were created. And both delivered lower \u2013 and in each case slightly different \u2013 predictions for cosmic expansion, the first 5% and the second 9% lower. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The latest discovery also stirs hypotheses about what fills the 95% of the cosmos that emits no light and no radiation, scientists said on Thursday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR One possibility for the discrepancy is that the universe has unknown subatomic particles, similar to neutrinos, that travel nearly as fast as the speed of light, about 186,000 miles (300,000km) per second. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Facebook Twitter Pinterest From left: Hubble is used to measure the distances to stars called Cepheid variables. Their brightness means they can be used as cosmic yardsticks to measure distances to galaxies. Astronomers then look for galaxies that contain Cepheids (centre) and Type Ia supernovae, and determine their distance. They then look for supernovae in more remote galaxies. The brightness of distant supernovae are compared to measure out to the distance where the expansion of the universe can be seen (right). Those measurements are compared with how light from the supernovae is stretched by the expansion of space. Illustration: A. Riess (STScI/JHU) and A. Feild (STScI)/NASA/ESA NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Another idea is that so-called \u201cdark energy\u201d, a mysterious, anti-gravity force discovered in 1998, may be shoving galaxies away from one another more powerfully than originally estimated. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cThis may be an important clue to understanding those parts of the universe that make up 95% of everything and that don\u2019t emit light, such as dark energy, dark matter and dark radiation,\u201d said Riess, with the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, Maryland. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Riess shared the 2011 Nobel prize in physics for the discovery that the expansion of the universe was speeding up. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The speedier universe also raises the possibility that Einstein\u2019s general theory of relativity, which serves as the mathematical scaffolding for calculating how the basic building blocks of matter interact, is slightly wrong, or at least incomplete. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cWe know so little about the dark parts of the universe, it\u2019s important to measure how they push and pull on space over cosmic history\u201d, said one of the team, Lucas Macri of Texas A&M University. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Such research has a long history of revision and updates. Einstein\u2019s original calculations for general relativity seemed to predict that the universe was expanding and \u2013 in what he is supposed to have described later as his greatest blunder \u2013 he confected a cosmological constant to correct what he thought was an error. In 1923, the great American astronomer Edwin Hubble stared through what was then the world\u2019s biggest telescope at what he thought was a nebula - cloud of dust \u2013 in the night sky and realised that he was observing another distant star system: the island universe of the Andromeda galaxy. And within two years he had observed the light signature of a receding galaxies, and proposed that everywhere in the universe, galaxies were rushing away each other, the farthest away at a greater rate. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But all astronomical observations depend on being able to calculate distances, and from that make ever more precise estimates of galactic recession. When the Hubble space telescope was first launched in 1990, estimates of the rate of cosmic expansion varied by a factor of two. Continuous observations seemed to narrow the range to ever more precise estimates. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Until 1998, astronomers thought they had got the big picture. The universe was expanding at a steady rate, but it might still be possible that expansion could halt, or even that the universe could contract. A team of astronomers staring at a class of stars called type 1a supernovae across enormous distances realised that the furthest were not just receding at the predicted rate: they were accelerating as if being driven by a mysterious force briefly dubbed \u201cantigravity\u201d. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It was the first hint of what, for want of a better term, is called dark energy: a so-far inexplicable force that is likely to keep the universe expanding forever. And it was at that point that cosmologists began to realise that all the gas, dust, planets, stars, galaxies and black holes they could account for added up to only about 4% of the universe. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Stunning Hubble Bubble Nebula image marks telescope's 26th birthday Read more NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It also raised the possibility that, an unimaginable number of years from now, all the other galaxies will have receded over some cosmic horizon, leaving the Milky Way alone in the visible universe, and with no distant objects to provide any evidence at all of accelerating cosmic expansion. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The latest advance on the speed of universal expansion builds on all these elements in a century of cosmological discovery. Riess and colleagues made their discovery by building a better cosmic yardstick to calculate distances. They used the Hubble Space Telescope to measure a particular type of star, known as Cepheid variables \u2013 the stars that gave Edwin Hubble and and his colleagues the first hint of an expanding universe - in 19 galaxies beyond our own Milky Way galaxy. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR How fast these stars pulse is directly related to how bright they are, which in turn can be used to calculate their distances, much like a 100-watt light bulb appears dimmer the farther away it is. They also used the type 1a supernovae as \u201cstandard candles\u201d and it had been this class of objects that had illuminated not just another advance in speed but speculation about dark energy. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The research will be published in an upcoming edition of the Astrophysical Journal.\nPassage 5:\nAdd this to the list of existential fears that keep you up at night: the universe appears to be expanding faster than we thought. A lot faster. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That\u2019s according to new, highly precise measurements of the distance between 19 faraway galaxies acquired by the Hubble Space Telescope. The new numbers indicate that the rate of expansion of our universe (the so-called \u201cHubble constant\u201d) is approximately 45.5 miles per second per megaparsec. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In slightly less baffling terms, space is expanding fast enough to essentially double the distance between our galaxy and our nearest neighbors in about 10 billion years. The new Hubble constant is 5 to 9 percent higher than previous estimates. It might not seem like that much, but when it comes to the fate of the entire universe, it constitutes a major discrepancy. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The discovery, which will be detailed in a forthcoming issue of The Astrophysical Journal, presents a problem for cosmologists, because it does not match estimated expansion rates from the energetic leftovers of the Big Bang. Two missions\u2014NASA\u2019s Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe and the European Space Agency\u2019s Planck satellite mission\u2014have both yielded smaller Hubble constants by examining the so-called \u201cafterglow\u201d of the mega-explosion that birthed our universe. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The discrepancy still needs to be independently verified. But if it holds up, it implies that there are underlying physical processes pushing space apart which we haven\u2019t fully accounted for. That\u2019s not too surprising when you consider that some 95 percent of our universe is made up of dark energy, dark matter, and dark radiation, all of which emit no light and are barely understood at all. Alternatively, it could mean that Einstein\u2019s theory of relativity is incomplete\u2014which is also kind of understandable, given that the man single-handedly penned the laws of existence in his twenties without the aid of a computer. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Advertisement NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Either way, it\u2019s an exciting reminder that the very fabric of reality is being shaped and stretched by forces we can barely comprehend. But one day, those forces will ensure that all of our atoms are dispersed across trillions of light years of vast nothingness.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"You start at two ends, and you expect to meet in the middle if all of your drawings are right and your measurements are right,\" Riess said. \"But now the ends are not quite meeting in the middle and we want to know why.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There are a few possible explanations for the universe's excessive speed. One possibility is that dark energy, already known to be accelerating the universe, may be shoving galaxies away from each other with even greater -- or growing -- strength. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Another idea is that the cosmos contained a new subatomic particle in its early history that traveled close to the speed of light. Such speedy particles are collectively referred to as \"dark radiation\" and include previously known particles like neutrinos. More energy from additional dark radiation could be throwing off the best efforts to predict today's expansion rate from its post-big bang trajectory. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The boost in acceleration could also mean that dark matter possesses some weird, unexpected characteristics. Dark matter is the backbone of the universe upon which galaxies built themselves up into the large-scale structures seen today. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And finally, the speedier universe may be telling astronomers that Einstein's theory of gravity is incomplete. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We know so little about the dark parts of the universe, it's important to measure how they push and pull on space over cosmic history,\" said Lucas Macri of Texas A&M; University in College Station, a key collaborator on the study. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Hubble observations were made with Hubble's sharp-eyed Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3), and were conducted by the Supernova H0 for the Equation of State (SH0ES) team, which works to refine the accuracy of the Hubble constant to a precision that allows for a better understanding of the universe's behavior. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The SH0ES Team is still using Hubble to reduce the uncertainty in the Hubble constant even more, with a goal to reach an accuracy of 1 percent. Current telescopes such as the European Space Agency's Gaia satellite, and future telescopes such as the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), an infrared observatory, and the Wide Field Infrared Space Telescope (WFIRST), also could help astronomers make better measurements of the expansion rate. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Before Hubble was launched in 1990, the estimates of the Hubble constant varied by a factor of two. In the late 1990s the Hubble Space Telescope Key Project on the Extragalactic Distance Scale refined the value of the Hubble constant to within an error of only 10 percent, accomplishing one of the telescope's key goals. The SH0ES team has reduced the uncertainty in the Hubble constant value by 76 percent since beginning its quest in 2005.

A megaparsec is 3.26 million light years. The consequence of this adjustment in difficult-to-imagine speeds over unthinkable distances is that the distance between cosmic objects will double in another 9.8 billion years. The catch is that such speeds do not match predictions for an expansion rate from other observations made by Nasa\u2019s Wilkinson microwave anisotropy Probe, or the European Space Agency\u2019s Planck satellite. Both went into orbit to study the afterglow of the Big Bang, in which time, space and matter were created. And both delivered lower \u2013 and in each case slightly different \u2013 predictions for cosmic expansion, the first 5% and the second 9% lower. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The latest discovery also stirs hypotheses about what fills the 95% of the cosmos that emits no light and no radiation, scientists said on Thursday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR One possibility for the discrepancy is that the universe has unknown subatomic particles, similar to neutrinos, that travel nearly as fast as the speed of light, about 186,000 miles (300,000km) per second.

Their brightness means they can be used as cosmic yardsticks to measure distances to galaxies. Astronomers then look for galaxies that contain Cepheids (centre) and Type Ia supernovae, and determine their distance. They then look for supernovae in more remote galaxies. The brightness of distant supernovae are compared to measure out to the distance where the expansion of the universe can be seen (right). Those measurements are compared with how light from the supernovae is stretched by the expansion of space. Illustration: A. Riess (STScI/JHU) and A. Feild (STScI)/NASA/ESA NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Another idea is that so-called \u201cdark energy\u201d, a mysterious, anti-gravity force discovered in 1998, may be shoving galaxies away from one another more powerfully than originally estimated. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cThis may be an important clue to understanding those parts of the universe that make up 95% of everything and that don\u2019t emit light, such as dark energy, dark matter and dark radiation,\u201d said Riess, with the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, Maryland. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Riess shared the 2011 Nobel prize in physics for the discovery that the expansion of the universe was speeding up. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The speedier universe also raises the possibility that Einstein\u2019s general theory of relativity, which serves as the mathematical scaffolding for calculating how the basic building blocks of matter interact, is slightly wrong, or at least incomplete. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cWe know so little about the dark parts of the universe, it\u2019s important to measure how they push and pull on space over cosmic history\u201d, said one of the team, Lucas Macri of Texas A&M University. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Such research has a long history of revision and updates. Einstein\u2019s original calculations for general relativity seemed to predict that the universe was expanding and \u2013 in what he is supposed to have described later as his greatest blunder \u2013 he confected a cosmological constant to correct what he thought was an error. In 1923, the great American astronomer Edwin Hubble stared through what was then the world\u2019s biggest telescope at what he thought was a nebula - cloud of dust \u2013 in the night sky and realised that he was observing another distant star system: the island universe of the Andromeda galaxy. And within two years he had observed the light signature of a receding galaxies, and proposed that everywhere in the universe, galaxies were rushing away each other, the farthest away at a greater rate. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But all astronomical observations depend on being able to calculate distances, and from that make ever more precise estimates of galactic recession. When the Hubble space telescope was first launched in 1990, estimates of the rate of cosmic expansion varied by a factor of two. Continuous observations seemed to narrow the range to ever more precise estimates. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Until 1998, astronomers thought they had got the big picture. The universe was expanding at a steady rate, but it might still be possible that expansion could halt, or even that the universe could contract. A team of astronomers staring at a class of stars called type 1a supernovae across enormous distances realised that the furthest were not just receding at the predicted rate: they were accelerating as if being driven by a mysterious force briefly dubbed \u201cantigravity\u201d. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It was the first hint of what, for want of a better term, is called dark energy: a so-far inexplicable force that is likely to keep the universe expanding forever. And it was at that point that cosmologists began to realise that all the gas, dust, planets, stars, galaxies and black holes they could account for added up to only about 4% of the universe. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Stunning Hubble Bubble Nebula image marks telescope's 26th birthday Read more NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It also raised the possibility that, an unimaginable number of years from now, all the other galaxies will have receded over some cosmic horizon, leaving the Milky Way alone in the visible universe, and with no distant objects to provide any evidence at all of accelerating cosmic expansion. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The latest advance on the speed of universal expansion builds on all these elements in a century of cosmological discovery. Riess and colleagues made their discovery by building a better cosmic yardstick to calculate distances. They used the Hubble Space Telescope to measure a particular type of star, known as Cepheid variables \u2013 the stars that gave Edwin Hubble and and his colleagues the first hint of an expanding universe - in 19 galaxies beyond our own Milky Way galaxy. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR How fast these stars pulse is directly related to how bright they are, which in turn can be used to calculate their distances, much like a 100-watt light bulb appears dimmer the farther away it is. They also used the type 1a supernovae as \u201cstandard candles\u201d and it had been this class of objects that had illuminated not just another advance in speed but speculation about dark energy. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The research will be published in an upcoming edition of the Astrophysical Journal.\nPassage 5:\nAdd this to the list of existential fears that keep you up at night: the universe appears to be expanding faster than we thought. A lot faster. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That\u2019s according to new, highly precise measurements of the distance between 19 faraway galaxies acquired by the Hubble Space Telescope. The new numbers indicate that the rate of expansion of our universe (the so-called \u201cHubble constant\u201d) is approximately 45.5 miles per second per megaparsec. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In slightly less baffling terms, space is expanding fast enough to essentially double the distance between our galaxy and our nearest neighbors in about 10 billion years. The new Hubble constant is 5 to 9 percent higher than previous estimates. It might not seem like that much, but when it comes to the fate of the entire universe, it constitutes a major discrepancy. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The discovery, which will be detailed in a forthcoming issue of The Astrophysical Journal, presents a problem for cosmologists, because it does not match estimated expansion rates from the energetic leftovers of the Big Bang. Two missions\u2014NASA\u2019s Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe and the European Space Agency\u2019s Planck satellite mission\u2014have both yielded smaller Hubble constants by examining the so-called \u201cafterglow\u201d of the mega-explosion that birthed our universe. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The discrepancy still needs to be independently verified. But if it holds up, it implies that there are underlying physical processes pushing space apart which we haven\u2019t fully accounted for. That\u2019s not too surprising when you consider that some 95 percent of our universe is made up of dark energy, dark matter, and dark radiation, all of which emit no light and are barely understood at all. Alternatively, it could mean that Einstein\u2019s theory of relativity is incomplete\u2014which is also kind of understandable, given that the man single-handedly penned the laws of existence in his twenties without the aid of a computer. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Advertisement NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Either way, it\u2019s an exciting reminder that the very fabric of reality is being shaped and stretched by forces we can barely comprehend.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Advertisement NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR These are just the injuries we know about. The facility has been open to staff since April 2017, while this is just three days\u2019 worth of 911 calls. It\u2019s possible that this could be somewhat of a never-ending problem, as Bloomberg reported Apple discouraged employees from ad hoc solutions like marking doors with post-it notes, while its moderately high turnover rate could result in newer hires remaining aloof on the issue until that terrible second of revelation. A search of OSHA records found no applicable results. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Apple building\u2019s design was the result of a relentless focus on aesthetics and form that Reuters reported was driven by the Apple team\u2019s belief that even standard features like doorway thresholds could distract engineers\u2019 lines of thought. In other words, the company wanted the building to allow staff to move quickly and without distractions or even physical cues as they moved throughout the spaceship, which sounds great until they started bonking into invisible barriers like someone who wandered into the house from Thirteen Ghosts. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Were one to assign blame here, they might take some cues from experts in safe working environments who pay close attention to preventable hazards. According to the Chronicle\u2019s account, Apple was given plenty of warning from local government officials. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Advertisement NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cWe did recognize that this is going to be an issue, especially when they clean the glass,\u201d Cupertino building official Albert Salvador told the paper. \u201cWhen you clean the windows, you can\u2019t even tell some of them are there.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He added that while visiting the Apple campus with the Santa Clara County Fire Department\u2019s Dirk Mattern, they were discussing the issue with a contractor when another walked directly into the glass.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Syrians battling to oust President Bashar al-Assad shouldn\u2019t settle for democracy as the reward for their sacrifices but should embrace strict Islamic sharia law when the Syrian regime has been finally defeated, says the emir of Al Qaeda in Iraq, Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In a recorded audio message lasting 20 minutes and released yesterday to jihadi websites, Al-Baghdadi acknowledged that Al Qaeda has been involved in the fighting in Syria, confirming that the Jihadist group Jabhat al-Nusra, which has become one of the most effective and disciplined rebel formations in the civil war, is an extension of Al Qaeda in Iraq, otherwise known as the Islamic State of Iraq. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Al-Nusra, which has launched more than 40 successful bombing attacks against mainly government military targets, often using suicide bombers, has been tagged a terrorist organization by the Obama administration because of its links with al-Qaeda. It has been enjoying growing cachet among Syrian rebels from recent operational accomplishments on the battlefield and has been in the vanguard of many successful full-scale rebel clashes with Assad forces. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Al-Baghdadi says that al-Nusra\u2019s ties with Al Qaeda were kept obscure for security reasons and to provide Syrians the opportunity to judge the jihadist fighters through their own eyes as opposed through the filter of a biased international media that would immediately have dismissed them. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR According to the Al Qaeda leader, there were already jihadist cells in Syria before the conflict erupted. These cells were \u201cawaiting the chance\u201d to expand their operations and when the civil war started Abu Muhammad Al-Julani was dispatched along with other Iraqi jihadists to establish al-Nusra and to set strategy. Al Qaeda in Iraq has been splitting its funds with al-Nusra, he says. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR His boast will be seized on by the Assad regime, which has consistently spun the propaganda line that the rebellion is a foreign conspiracy relying on terrorists and foreign Jihadist fighters. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The evidence on the ground is that al-Nusra has been able to swell its ranks with homegrown fighters as well foreigners drawn from elsewhere in the Middle East, North Africa, and Central Asia and with a sprinkling from Europe. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Obama administration, which took major criticism from Syrian rebels for tagging al-Nusra a terrorist organization, will likely highlight al-Baghdadi\u2019s remarks as final justification for its desgination. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Al-Baghdadi is a highly effective if brutal leader. He has been responsible for directing large-scale operations in Iraq such as the August 28, 2011 attack on the Umm al-Qura mosque in Baghdad that killed prominent Sunni lawmaker Khalid al-Fahdawi. He has had deep experience in setting up jihadist groups and organized the flow of fighters from Syria and elsewhere into Iraq, a recruitment process that strengthened Al Qaeda in Iraq, say U.S. intelligence sources. He became the emir of Al Qaeda in Iraq in 2010. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On December 2, 2012 Iraqi officials claimed that they had captured him in Baghdad following a two-month-long investigation but later admitted they had lifted a less important jihadist leader. Al Baghdadi became notorious before taking over the Al Qaeda leadership for running Islamic courts to try locals for working with the Iraqi government and coalition forces and would sometimes abduct whole families. Those he found guilty were publicly executed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Al-Baghdadi\u2019s remarks are likely to complicate the arming of Syrian rebels by Gulf powers. Since January, Saudi Arabia and Qatar have increased significantly weapon supplies to brigades affiliated with the Free Syrian Army in the hope that the weapons would shift the balance of the war decisively and quickly in favor of the rebels. But videos posted by al-Nusra last month show their fighters using Croatian anti-tank weapons the Gulf powers are thought to have earmarked for the FSA. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The British and French governments have been pushing to increase the flow of weapons to the Syrian rebels and for a European Union arms embargo to be lifted, but other European nations have resisted, arguing the equipment would fall into the hands of jihadist groups such as al-Nusra. European critics of the Anglo-French position say the intended recipients of the weapons, the FSA rebel units, work too closely with al-Nusra to keep the weapons to themselves, say German diplomats involved in EU negotiations. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cWe are concerned that the FSA isn\u2019t really a cohesive force with a single command-and-control structure,\u201d says a German diplomat based in Brussels. \u201cThe FSA can\u2019t stop weaponry from being shared with al-Nusra and other jihadists,\u201d he says. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR According to al-Baghdadi al-Nusra will now be officially merged with Al Qaeda in Iraq and the two groups will operate under the name Islamic State of Iraq and Al-Sham. The name change is significant and highlights Al Qaeda\u2019s ambitions to use the Syrian conflict for greater regional goals. Al-Sham refers to Greater Syria, a pan-Arab geographical definition of a hypothetical united Arab state that corresponds to a medieval Arab province encompassing the eastern Mediterranean Sea, the Levant as well as Western Mesopotamia. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In recent weeks al-Nusra fighters have come closer to Lebanon and the likelihood has increased of a confrontation along the border between Lebanon\u2019s Shiite armed movement Hezbollah and Sunni jihadists with al-Nusra, who have been moving into Shiite villages on the Syrian side of the border along a 30-mile stretch in the mountainous al-Nabk area about 50 miles north of Damascus, say Lebanese intelligence sources.

We will not share your email with anyone for any reason NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In his audio message al-Baghdadi says the new merged group will not abide by geographical borders or be constrained by ethnic affiliations. That echoes what al-Nusra has said in recent months to other smaller Jihadist groups fighting in Syria. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In January al-Nusra issued a call to arms after a meeting in the Syrian province of Deir al-Zour with nine other jihadist groups. Al-Nusra urged all jihadist brigades to \u201cunite in the cause of Allah, organize the efforts and the attacks against the soldiers of disbelief and apostasy, and distinguish the ranks of truth from falsehood.\u201d The statement continued: \u201cWe call upon our sincere mujahedin brothers all over the strong Levant to unite their ranks in groups, pure of the filth of suspicious groups and the infiltration of people who have no qualities or faith, in order to clarify their banner and purify their path.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As well as being at the forefront of major battles with Syrian government forces, al-Nusra has unleashed a bombing campaign. Its first suicide bombing came nine months after the uprising against Assad began with a two-car bomb attack on December 23, 2011\u2014targeting the regime\u2019s intelligence offices, killing at least 44 people, and wounding more than 160. According to the U.S. National Counterterrorism Center, it is likely that two female suicide bombers from Iraq carried out that attack. Since then the pace of al-Nusra bombings has increased from one a month in the first three months of 2012 to four to six a month now. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The group has been careful in the past to limit its jihadi messages when interacting with locals in rebel-held territory and has talked more in terms of assisting the poor. It has basked in growing popularity in the rebel areas of Idlib and Aleppo provinces tucked under the border with Turkey. Civilians contrast the discipline and honesty of al-Nusra fighters with some FSA fighters and argue the jihadists share war spoils with civilians unlike FSA units.\nPassage 2:\nIn this Friday, Jan. 11, 2013 file citizen journalism image provided by Edlib News Network, ENN, which has been authenticated based on its contents and other AP reporting, shows rebels from al-Qaida affiliated Jabhat al-Nusra waving their brigade flag as they step on the top of a Syrian air force helicopter, at Taftanaz air base that was captured by the rebels, in Idlib province, northern Syria. (AP Photo/Edlib News Network ENN, File) | AP NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR BEIRUT \u2014 Tensions emerged Wednesday in a newly announced alliance between al-Qaida's franchise in Iraq and the most powerful Syrian rebel faction, which said it was not consulted before the Iraqi group announced their merger and only heard about it through the media. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Al-Qaida in Iraq said Tuesday that it had joined forces with Jabhat al-Nusra or the Nusra Front \u2013 the most effective force among the mosaic of rebel brigades fighting to topple President Bashar Assad in Syria's civil war. It said they had formed a new alliance called the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Syrian government seized upon the purported merger to back its assertion that it is not facing a true popular movement for change but rather a foreign-backed terrorist plot. The state news agency said Wednesday that the union \"proves that this opposition was never anything other than a tool used by the West and by terrorists to destroy the Syrian people.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Talk of an alliance between Jabhat al-Nusra and al-Qaida in Iraq has raised fears in Baghdad, where intelligence officials said increased cooperation was already evident in a number of deadly attacks. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And in Syria, a stronger Jabhat al-Nusra would only further complicate the battlefield where Western powers have been covertly trying to funnel weapons, training and aid toward more secular rebel groups and army defectors. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Washington has designated Jabhat al-Nusra a terrorist organization over its links with al-Qaida, and the Syrian group's now public ties with the terrorist network are unlikely to prompt a shift in international support for the broader Syrian opposition. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Earlier this year, the U.S. announced a $60 million non-lethal assistance package for Syria that includes meals and medical supplies for the armed opposition. It was greeted unenthusiastically by some rebel leaders, who said it does far too little. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Washington's next step is expected to be a broader package of non-lethal assistance, expanding from food and medical supplies to body armor and night-vision goggles. However, President Barack Obama has not given final approval on any new package and an announcement is not imminent, a senior administration official said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Secretary of State John Kerry, who met with Syrian opposition leaders in London on Wednesday, hinted at the new non-lethal aid package this week, saying the administration had been holding intense talks on how to boost assistance to the rebels. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The U.S. opposes directly arming Syrian opposition fighters, in part out of fear that the weapons could fall into the hands of Islamic extremists such as Jabhat al-Nusra. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The apparent tensions between Jabhat al-Nusra and al-Qaida in Iraq emerged on Wednesday, when Nusra leader Abu Mohammad al-Golani appeared to distance himself from claims the two groups had merged. Instead, he pledged allegiance to al-Qaida's leader, Ayman al-Zawahiri. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Al-Golani said he was not consulted about the merger and only heard about it through the media. He did not deny the two groups had united, but remained vague, saying the announcement was premature and that his group will continue to use Jabhat al-Nusra as its name. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The banner of the Front will remain unchanged despite our pride in the banner of the State and those who carried it and sacrificed and shed their blood for it,\" he said in a reference to al-Qaida in Iraq, formally known as the Islamic State in Iraq. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The message appeared to be, at least in part, an effort by Jabhat al-Nusra to reassure Syrians that the group remains dedicated to the uprising to oust Assad and is not beholden to non-Syrian interests despite its pledge of fealty to al-Qaida. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"What you saw from the Front of its defense of your religion, honors, and blood, and its good qualities with you and the fighting groups, will remain as you experienced it,\" al-Golani said in remarks addressed to the Syrian people. \"The announcement of the pledge of allegiance will not change anything in its (Nusra's) policy.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Al-Golani's message was first reported by the SITE Intelligence Group, which monitors extremist websites. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Earlier this week, al-Zawahiri urged Islamic fighters in Syria to unite in their efforts to oust Assad. That may have provided at least part of the impetus for the announced merger with al-Qaida in Iraq. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The purported unification was announced by ISI leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in a 21-minute audio message posted on militant websites late Monday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the recording, al-Golani confirmed his group's long-standing, close ties with al-Qaida's Iraqi franchise, and expressed gratitude for the money and manpower it provided to help get Jabhat al-Nusra off the ground. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Syrian group has made little secret of its links across the Iraqi border, but until now it has not officially declared itself to be part of al-Qaida. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It was unclear what impact the apparent tensions might have on relations between the groups, although they have shown increasing cooperation in recent months, according to intelligence officials in the region. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jabhat al-Nusra, which wants to oust Assad and replace his regime with an Islamic state, first emerged in a video posted online in January 2012. Since then, it has demonstrated its prowess \u2013 and ruthlessness \u2013 on the battlefield. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It has claimed responsibility for many of the deadliest suicide bombings against Syrian government institutions and military facilities. The group's success helped fuel a surge in its popularity among rebel fighters, although it has also emerged as a source of friction with more moderate and secular brigades in Syria. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Iraqi officials say the groups are sharing three military training compounds, logistics, intelligence and weapons, and are growing in strength around the Syria-Iraq border. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR One of the most dramatic attacks by the group \u2013 and at the time the clearest indication of cross-border cooperation with al-Qaida in Iraq \u2013 came on March 4, when 51 Syrian soldiers were killed in a well-coordinated ambush. The Syrians had crossed into Iraq to seek refuge following clashes with rebels on the Syrian side of the border. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Inside Syria, the news of Jabhat al-Nusra's fealty to al-Qaida mattered little to some activists, for whom the fight against the regime is paramount. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Abu Raed, an activist in Aleppo province, said the merger \"is of no interest to anyone here.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The rebels in Syria have one common goal, which is toppling the regime of Bashar Assad and anything that comes from the outside is of no interest to us,\" Abu Raed said, giving only an alias because of security concerns. \"There is room for different opinions in the revolution and the important thing is the common goal.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Also Wednesday, activists said at least 42 people were killed in clashes between regime forces and rebels in the villages of Sanamein and Ghebgha in the southern province of Daraa, including 16 fighters and three soldiers. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Fighting in the province has escalated in recent weeks as fighters capitalize on an influx of weapons to advance in the strategically important region along the border with Jordan. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ___ NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Associated Press writers Barbara Surk and Zeina Karam in Beirut contributed to this report.\nPassage 3:\nStory highlights Peter Bergen: The announcement of links between Syrian insurgents, al Qaeda is worrying NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He says it gives al Qaeda an opportunity to demonstrate that it is still relevant NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The insurgent group, al-Nusra, is the most effective of the rebel groups in Syria, he says NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Bergen: The Obama administration has been right to move deliberately on aid to rebels NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Tuesday, al Qaeda's affiliate in Iraq announced that it had merged with the Syrian opposition group Jabhat al-Nusra to form the \"Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The announcement came in the form of an audio message from the leader of al Qaeda in Iraq, Sheikh Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, that was distributed to key jihadist websites. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The merger was first reported by SITE, a Washington-based group that tracks jihadist material online. The authors were able to confirm the announcement by monitoring the jihadist site, Ansar al Mujahideen, which frequently posts material from al Qaeda, including Tuesday's news of the merger of the Syrian and Iraqi wings of al Qaeda. Complicating matters, on Wednesday al Nusra claimed it wasn't merging with al Qaeda's affiliate in Iraq, but instead was pledging its allegiance to al Qaeda's overall leadership. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The news that there is some kind of connection between al Qaeda in Iraq and the Syrian Jabhat al-Nusra (in English \"the Victory Front\") is not entirely surprising. U.S. officials have long suspected that al-Nusra was really, in part, a front for Iraqi jihadists who had crossed the Syrian border to join the fight against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. The State Department added Jabhat al-Nusra to its list of designated foreign terrorist organizations in December. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Peter Bergen NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The fact that al-Nusra has publicly aligned itself with central al Qaeda is worrisome. A long-term safe haven for this group in Syria could be the prelude for the formation of an organization with the wherewithal to attack the West, just as al Qaeda's sojourn in Afghanistan when it was controlled by the Taliban prepared the group for the 9/11 attacks. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Second, al-Nusra is widely regarded as the most effective fighting force in Syria, and its thousands of fighters are the most disciplined of the forces opposing Assad. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Al-Nusra is also the first al Qaeda affiliate to take a page out of Hezbollah's book and operate not only as an effective fighting force but also as a large-scale provider of services , for instance, distributing enormous quantities of desperately needed bread in the areas of Syria that the group controls. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Finally, al-Nusra is the first jihadist group for many years that has chosen to merge with al Qaeda at a time when it is having significant success on the battlefield. Al Qaeda's North African franchise, al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, as well as the Yemen-based al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, both announced their affiliation with al Qaeda only when they were struggling for resources and exposure. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While al-Nusra is enjoying real battlefield success in Syria, it is formally allying itself to al Qaeda at a time of great weakness for the global terrorist organization. The announcement of the merger with al-Nusra provides al Qaeda's leaders, now headed by the Egyptian Dr. Ayman al-Zawahiri, the chance to prove they are still relevant. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Al Qaeda has received severe blows in recent years: a contingent of U.S. Navy SEALs killed the group's leader, Osama bin Laden, two years ago, while CIA drone strikes have decimated al Qaeda's ranks in Pakistan's tribal regions, and the group hasn't pulled off an attack in the West since the suicide bombings on the London transportation system in 2005.

MUST WATCH Surviving al Qaeda 05:28 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sheikh al-Baghdadi, the leader of al Qaeda in Iraq, said that he had delayed the announcement of the formal merger with al-Nusra because he wanted to allow Syrians time to get to know al-Nusra on its own terms, without the inherent negative bias that would be caused by an early announcement of its ties to al Qaeda. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This was prudent. Had al-Nusra voiced its links to al Qaeda during the rebellion's nascent stages, al-Assad would have had an easier time blaming the uprising on \"terrorists\" as he has done since violence first broke out in Syria in March 2011. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Syria is in its third year of a bitter civil war that has claimed the lives of more than 70,000 people, and wide swaths of the population support the opposition. In these circumstances, if al-Nusra continues to fight effectively against al-Assad, Syrians are not, at least for the moment, likely to care too much about what the group's broader ideological leanings are. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For al-Nusra the gains of a public announcement of its alliance with al Qaeda are far from clear. In fact, it is likely to be quite counterproductive. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR According to Leila Hilal, a Syrian-American who meets regularly with the Syrian opposition and is the head of the Middle East Task Force at the New America Foundation, the merger announcement may \"confirm the suspicions of much of the Syrian public that al-Nusra is not fighting for a free Syria, but for the establishment of an ultra-fundamentalist state.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That might explain why the head of al-Nusra, Abu Mohammed al-Jawlani, claimed in an audio message released on Wednesday that he wasn't \"consulted\" on the announcement of the merger of the Syrian and Iraqi wings of al Qaeda. Jawlani then stepped on his effort at damage control by announcing his pledge of allegiance to Ayman al-Zawahiri, who is, of course, the overall head of al Qaeda worldwide. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For al Qaeda, the advantages of commanding an effective, large-scale fighting force in Syria, which is in the heart of the Arab world and borders on Israel, are all too obvious. The people of Syria, however, should have good reason to worry about this ominous development. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Finally, the announcement that al Nusra has pledged allegiance to al Qaeda underlines that the Obama administration's seeming dithering about how exactly to aid the Syrian opposition makes more sense than it has done hitherto. There clearly are unintended consequences and risks in supporting the Syrian opposition, which is fractured into hundreds of local groups, some elements of which are hardly supportive of the United States. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Obama administration decision, reported by CNN Tuesday , to sign off on a new tranche of nonlethal aid to the rebels in Syria is best understood as an effort to bolster the Syrian opposition groups that are separate from al-Nusra and to give them a better fighting chance in what everyone agrees is likely a long Syrian war in which al-Assad is eventually removed from power -- but only then, unfortunately, does the real fighting for lasting power begin.\n\n\nNow, write a one-page summary of all the news.\n\nSummary:", "input": "", "context": "Passage 1:\nA merger between terrorist groups spells even more trouble for Syrians caught in the middle.

It has been enjoying growing cachet among Syrian rebels from recent operational accomplishments on the battlefield and has been in the vanguard of many successful full-scale rebel clashes with Assad forces. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Al-Baghdadi says that al-Nusra\u2019s ties with Al Qaeda were kept obscure for security reasons and to provide Syrians the opportunity to judge the jihadist fighters through their own eyes as opposed through the filter of a biased international media that would immediately have dismissed them. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR According to the Al Qaeda leader, there were already jihadist cells in Syria before the conflict erupted. These cells were \u201cawaiting the chance\u201d to expand their operations and when the civil war started Abu Muhammad Al-Julani was dispatched along with other Iraqi jihadists to establish al-Nusra and to set strategy. Al Qaeda in Iraq has been splitting its funds with al-Nusra, he says. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR His boast will be seized on by the Assad regime, which has consistently spun the propaganda line that the rebellion is a foreign conspiracy relying on terrorists and foreign Jihadist fighters. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The evidence on the ground is that al-Nusra has been able to swell its ranks with homegrown fighters as well foreigners drawn from elsewhere in the Middle East, North Africa, and Central Asia and with a sprinkling from Europe. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Obama administration, which took major criticism from Syrian rebels for tagging al-Nusra a terrorist organization, will likely highlight al-Baghdadi\u2019s remarks as final justification for its desgination. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Al-Baghdadi is a highly effective if brutal leader. He has been responsible for directing large-scale operations in Iraq such as the August 28, 2011 attack on the Umm al-Qura mosque in Baghdad that killed prominent Sunni lawmaker Khalid al-Fahdawi. He has had deep experience in setting up jihadist groups and organized the flow of fighters from Syria and elsewhere into Iraq, a recruitment process that strengthened Al Qaeda in Iraq, say U.S. intelligence sources. He became the emir of Al Qaeda in Iraq in 2010. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On December 2, 2012 Iraqi officials claimed that they had captured him in Baghdad following a two-month-long investigation but later admitted they had lifted a less important jihadist leader. Al Baghdadi became notorious before taking over the Al Qaeda leadership for running Islamic courts to try locals for working with the Iraqi government and coalition forces and would sometimes abduct whole families. Those he found guilty were publicly executed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Al-Baghdadi\u2019s remarks are likely to complicate the arming of Syrian rebels by Gulf powers. Since January, Saudi Arabia and Qatar have increased significantly weapon supplies to brigades affiliated with the Free Syrian Army in the hope that the weapons would shift the balance of the war decisively and quickly in favor of the rebels. But videos posted by al-Nusra last month show their fighters using Croatian anti-tank weapons the Gulf powers are thought to have earmarked for the FSA. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The British and French governments have been pushing to increase the flow of weapons to the Syrian rebels and for a European Union arms embargo to be lifted, but other European nations have resisted, arguing the equipment would fall into the hands of jihadist groups such as al-Nusra. European critics of the Anglo-French position say the intended recipients of the weapons, the FSA rebel units, work too closely with al-Nusra to keep the weapons to themselves, say German diplomats involved in EU negotiations. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cWe are concerned that the FSA isn\u2019t really a cohesive force with a single command-and-control structure,\u201d says a German diplomat based in Brussels. \u201cThe FSA can\u2019t stop weaponry from being shared with al-Nusra and other jihadists,\u201d he says. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR According to al-Baghdadi al-Nusra will now be officially merged with Al Qaeda in Iraq and the two groups will operate under the name Islamic State of Iraq and Al-Sham. The name change is significant and highlights Al Qaeda\u2019s ambitions to use the Syrian conflict for greater regional goals. Al-Sham refers to Greater Syria, a pan-Arab geographical definition of a hypothetical united Arab state that corresponds to a medieval Arab province encompassing the eastern Mediterranean Sea, the Levant as well as Western Mesopotamia. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In recent weeks al-Nusra fighters have come closer to Lebanon and the likelihood has increased of a confrontation along the border between Lebanon\u2019s Shiite armed movement Hezbollah and Sunni jihadists with al-Nusra, who have been moving into Shiite villages on the Syrian side of the border along a 30-mile stretch in the mountainous al-Nabk area about 50 miles north of Damascus, say Lebanese intelligence sources.

We will not share your email with anyone for any reason NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In his audio message al-Baghdadi says the new merged group will not abide by geographical borders or be constrained by ethnic affiliations. That echoes what al-Nusra has said in recent months to other smaller Jihadist groups fighting in Syria. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In January al-Nusra issued a call to arms after a meeting in the Syrian province of Deir al-Zour with nine other jihadist groups. Al-Nusra urged all jihadist brigades to \u201cunite in the cause of Allah, organize the efforts and the attacks against the soldiers of disbelief and apostasy, and distinguish the ranks of truth from falsehood.\u201d The statement continued: \u201cWe call upon our sincere mujahedin brothers all over the strong Levant to unite their ranks in groups, pure of the filth of suspicious groups and the infiltration of people who have no qualities or faith, in order to clarify their banner and purify their path.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As well as being at the forefront of major battles with Syrian government forces, al-Nusra has unleashed a bombing campaign. Its first suicide bombing came nine months after the uprising against Assad began with a two-car bomb attack on December 23, 2011\u2014targeting the regime\u2019s intelligence offices, killing at least 44 people, and wounding more than 160. According to the U.S. National Counterterrorism Center, it is likely that two female suicide bombers from Iraq carried out that attack. Since then the pace of al-Nusra bombings has increased from one a month in the first three months of 2012 to four to six a month now. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The group has been careful in the past to limit its jihadi messages when interacting with locals in rebel-held territory and has talked more in terms of assisting the poor. It has basked in growing popularity in the rebel areas of Idlib and Aleppo provinces tucked under the border with Turkey. Civilians contrast the discipline and honesty of al-Nusra fighters with some FSA fighters and argue the jihadists share war spoils with civilians unlike FSA units.\nPassage 2:\nIn this Friday, Jan. 11, 2013 file citizen journalism image provided by Edlib News Network, ENN, which has been authenticated based on its contents and other AP reporting, shows rebels from al-Qaida affiliated Jabhat al-Nusra waving their brigade flag as they step on the top of a Syrian air force helicopter, at Taftanaz air base that was captured by the rebels, in Idlib province, northern Syria. (AP Photo/Edlib News Network ENN, File) | AP NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR BEIRUT \u2014 Tensions emerged Wednesday in a newly announced alliance between al-Qaida's franchise in Iraq and the most powerful Syrian rebel faction, which said it was not consulted before the Iraqi group announced their merger and only heard about it through the media. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Al-Qaida in Iraq said Tuesday that it had joined forces with Jabhat al-Nusra or the Nusra Front \u2013 the most effective force among the mosaic of rebel brigades fighting to topple President Bashar Assad in Syria's civil war. It said they had formed a new alliance called the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Syrian government seized upon the purported merger to back its assertion that it is not facing a true popular movement for change but rather a foreign-backed terrorist plot. The state news agency said Wednesday that the union \"proves that this opposition was never anything other than a tool used by the West and by terrorists to destroy the Syrian people.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Talk of an alliance between Jabhat al-Nusra and al-Qaida in Iraq has raised fears in Baghdad, where intelligence officials said increased cooperation was already evident in a number of deadly attacks. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And in Syria, a stronger Jabhat al-Nusra would only further complicate the battlefield where Western powers have been covertly trying to funnel weapons, training and aid toward more secular rebel groups and army defectors. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Washington has designated Jabhat al-Nusra a terrorist organization over its links with al-Qaida, and the Syrian group's now public ties with the terrorist network are unlikely to prompt a shift in international support for the broader Syrian opposition. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Earlier this year, the U.S. announced a $60 million non-lethal assistance package for Syria that includes meals and medical supplies for the armed opposition. It was greeted unenthusiastically by some rebel leaders, who said it does far too little. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Washington's next step is expected to be a broader package of non-lethal assistance, expanding from food and medical supplies to body armor and night-vision goggles. However, President Barack Obama has not given final approval on any new package and an announcement is not imminent, a senior administration official said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Secretary of State John Kerry, who met with Syrian opposition leaders in London on Wednesday, hinted at the new non-lethal aid package this week, saying the administration had been holding intense talks on how to boost assistance to the rebels. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The U.S. opposes directly arming Syrian opposition fighters, in part out of fear that the weapons could fall into the hands of Islamic extremists such as Jabhat al-Nusra. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The apparent tensions between Jabhat al-Nusra and al-Qaida in Iraq emerged on Wednesday, when Nusra leader Abu Mohammad al-Golani appeared to distance himself from claims the two groups had merged. Instead, he pledged allegiance to al-Qaida's leader, Ayman al-Zawahiri. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Al-Golani said he was not consulted about the merger and only heard about it through the media. He did not deny the two groups had united, but remained vague, saying the announcement was premature and that his group will continue to use Jabhat al-Nusra as its name. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The banner of the Front will remain unchanged despite our pride in the banner of the State and those who carried it and sacrificed and shed their blood for it,\" he said in a reference to al-Qaida in Iraq, formally known as the Islamic State in Iraq. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The message appeared to be, at least in part, an effort by Jabhat al-Nusra to reassure Syrians that the group remains dedicated to the uprising to oust Assad and is not beholden to non-Syrian interests despite its pledge of fealty to al-Qaida. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"What you saw from the Front of its defense of your religion, honors, and blood, and its good qualities with you and the fighting groups, will remain as you experienced it,\" al-Golani said in remarks addressed to the Syrian people. \"The announcement of the pledge of allegiance will not change anything in its (Nusra's) policy.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Al-Golani's message was first reported by the SITE Intelligence Group, which monitors extremist websites. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Earlier this week, al-Zawahiri urged Islamic fighters in Syria to unite in their efforts to oust Assad. That may have provided at least part of the impetus for the announced merger with al-Qaida in Iraq. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The purported unification was announced by ISI leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in a 21-minute audio message posted on militant websites late Monday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the recording, al-Golani confirmed his group's long-standing, close ties with al-Qaida's Iraqi franchise, and expressed gratitude for the money and manpower it provided to help get Jabhat al-Nusra off the ground. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Syrian group has made little secret of its links across the Iraqi border, but until now it has not officially declared itself to be part of al-Qaida. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It was unclear what impact the apparent tensions might have on relations between the groups, although they have shown increasing cooperation in recent months, according to intelligence officials in the region. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jabhat al-Nusra, which wants to oust Assad and replace his regime with an Islamic state, first emerged in a video posted online in January 2012. Since then, it has demonstrated its prowess \u2013 and ruthlessness \u2013 on the battlefield. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It has claimed responsibility for many of the deadliest suicide bombings against Syrian government institutions and military facilities. The group's success helped fuel a surge in its popularity among rebel fighters, although it has also emerged as a source of friction with more moderate and secular brigades in Syria. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Iraqi officials say the groups are sharing three military training compounds, logistics, intelligence and weapons, and are growing in strength around the Syria-Iraq border. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR One of the most dramatic attacks by the group \u2013 and at the time the clearest indication of cross-border cooperation with al-Qaida in Iraq \u2013 came on March 4, when 51 Syrian soldiers were killed in a well-coordinated ambush. The Syrians had crossed into Iraq to seek refuge following clashes with rebels on the Syrian side of the border. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Inside Syria, the news of Jabhat al-Nusra's fealty to al-Qaida mattered little to some activists, for whom the fight against the regime is paramount. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Abu Raed, an activist in Aleppo province, said the merger \"is of no interest to anyone here.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The rebels in Syria have one common goal, which is toppling the regime of Bashar Assad and anything that comes from the outside is of no interest to us,\" Abu Raed said, giving only an alias because of security concerns. \"There is room for different opinions in the revolution and the important thing is the common goal.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Also Wednesday, activists said at least 42 people were killed in clashes between regime forces and rebels in the villages of Sanamein and Ghebgha in the southern province of Daraa, including 16 fighters and three soldiers. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Fighting in the province has escalated in recent weeks as fighters capitalize on an influx of weapons to advance in the strategically important region along the border with Jordan. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ___ NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Associated Press writers Barbara Surk and Zeina Karam in Beirut contributed to this report.\nPassage 3:\nStory highlights Peter Bergen: The announcement of links between Syrian insurgents, al Qaeda is worrying NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He says it gives al Qaeda an opportunity to demonstrate that it is still relevant NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The insurgent group, al-Nusra, is the most effective of the rebel groups in Syria, he says NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Bergen: The Obama administration has been right to move deliberately on aid to rebels NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Tuesday, al Qaeda's affiliate in Iraq announced that it had merged with the Syrian opposition group Jabhat al-Nusra to form the \"Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The announcement came in the form of an audio message from the leader of al Qaeda in Iraq, Sheikh Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, that was distributed to key jihadist websites. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The merger was first reported by SITE, a Washington-based group that tracks jihadist material online. The authors were able to confirm the announcement by monitoring the jihadist site, Ansar al Mujahideen, which frequently posts material from al Qaeda, including Tuesday's news of the merger of the Syrian and Iraqi wings of al Qaeda. Complicating matters, on Wednesday al Nusra claimed it wasn't merging with al Qaeda's affiliate in Iraq, but instead was pledging its allegiance to al Qaeda's overall leadership. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The news that there is some kind of connection between al Qaeda in Iraq and the Syrian Jabhat al-Nusra (in English \"the Victory Front\") is not entirely surprising. U.S. officials have long suspected that al-Nusra was really, in part, a front for Iraqi jihadists who had crossed the Syrian border to join the fight against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. The State Department added Jabhat al-Nusra to its list of designated foreign terrorist organizations in December. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Peter Bergen NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The fact that al-Nusra has publicly aligned itself with central al Qaeda is worrisome. A long-term safe haven for this group in Syria could be the prelude for the formation of an organization with the wherewithal to attack the West, just as al Qaeda's sojourn in Afghanistan when it was controlled by the Taliban prepared the group for the 9/11 attacks. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Second, al-Nusra is widely regarded as the most effective fighting force in Syria, and its thousands of fighters are the most disciplined of the forces opposing Assad. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Al-Nusra is also the first al Qaeda affiliate to take a page out of Hezbollah's book and operate not only as an effective fighting force but also as a large-scale provider of services , for instance, distributing enormous quantities of desperately needed bread in the areas of Syria that the group controls. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Finally, al-Nusra is the first jihadist group for many years that has chosen to merge with al Qaeda at a time when it is having significant success on the battlefield. Al Qaeda's North African franchise, al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, as well as the Yemen-based al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, both announced their affiliation with al Qaeda only when they were struggling for resources and exposure. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While al-Nusra is enjoying real battlefield success in Syria, it is formally allying itself to al Qaeda at a time of great weakness for the global terrorist organization. The announcement of the merger with al-Nusra provides al Qaeda's leaders, now headed by the Egyptian Dr. Ayman al-Zawahiri, the chance to prove they are still relevant. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Al Qaeda has received severe blows in recent years: a contingent of U.S. Navy SEALs killed the group's leader, Osama bin Laden, two years ago, while CIA drone strikes have decimated al Qaeda's ranks in Pakistan's tribal regions, and the group hasn't pulled off an attack in the West since the suicide bombings on the London transportation system in 2005.

MUST WATCH Surviving al Qaeda 05:28 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sheikh al-Baghdadi, the leader of al Qaeda in Iraq, said that he had delayed the announcement of the formal merger with al-Nusra because he wanted to allow Syrians time to get to know al-Nusra on its own terms, without the inherent negative bias that would be caused by an early announcement of its ties to al Qaeda. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This was prudent. Had al-Nusra voiced its links to al Qaeda during the rebellion's nascent stages, al-Assad would have had an easier time blaming the uprising on \"terrorists\" as he has done since violence first broke out in Syria in March 2011. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Syria is in its third year of a bitter civil war that has claimed the lives of more than 70,000 people, and wide swaths of the population support the opposition. In these circumstances, if al-Nusra continues to fight effectively against al-Assad, Syrians are not, at least for the moment, likely to care too much about what the group's broader ideological leanings are. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For al-Nusra the gains of a public announcement of its alliance with al Qaeda are far from clear. In fact, it is likely to be quite counterproductive. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR According to Leila Hilal, a Syrian-American who meets regularly with the Syrian opposition and is the head of the Middle East Task Force at the New America Foundation, the merger announcement may \"confirm the suspicions of much of the Syrian public that al-Nusra is not fighting for a free Syria, but for the establishment of an ultra-fundamentalist state.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That might explain why the head of al-Nusra, Abu Mohammed al-Jawlani, claimed in an audio message released on Wednesday that he wasn't \"consulted\" on the announcement of the merger of the Syrian and Iraqi wings of al Qaeda. Jawlani then stepped on his effort at damage control by announcing his pledge of allegiance to Ayman al-Zawahiri, who is, of course, the overall head of al Qaeda worldwide. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For al Qaeda, the advantages of commanding an effective, large-scale fighting force in Syria, which is in the heart of the Arab world and borders on Israel, are all too obvious. The people of Syria, however, should have good reason to worry about this ominous development. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Finally, the announcement that al Nusra has pledged allegiance to al Qaeda underlines that the Obama administration's seeming dithering about how exactly to aid the Syrian opposition makes more sense than it has done hitherto. There clearly are unintended consequences and risks in supporting the Syrian opposition, which is fractured into hundreds of local groups, some elements of which are hardly supportive of the United States. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Obama administration decision, reported by CNN Tuesday , to sign off on a new tranche of nonlethal aid to the rebels in Syria is best understood as an effort to bolster the Syrian opposition groups that are separate from al-Nusra and to give them a better fighting chance in what everyone agrees is likely a long Syrian war in which al-Assad is eventually removed from power -- but only then, unfortunately, does the real fighting for lasting power begin.\n", "answers": ["The head of Jabhat al-Nusra, a jihadist group at the forefront of Syria's civil war, has pledged allegiance to al-Qaeda honcho Ayman al-Zawahiri. What that means isn't exactly crystal clear at this point. While Al-Qaeda in Iraq says the groups have merged under the snappy title of the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant, al-Nusra chief Abu Mohammed al-Jawalani denies his group will be ordering new letterhead just yet, the BBC reports. \"The banner of the Front will remain unchanged despite our pride in the banner of the State and those who carried it and sacrificed and shed their blood for it,\" he said in an audio message, the AP reports. Al-Nusra is among the most effective of the rebel groups fighting the Syrian government. It has committed more than 40 successful bombing attacks and has been on the frontline of clashes against Assad forces, adds the Daily Beast. The alliance is not a surprise (Obama labeled it a terrorist organization last year), but it is concerning, says CNN. Al-Nusra's success on the battlefield and reputation for distributing free bread makes it popular with everyday Syrians. With a powerful army in Syria, al-Qaeda would gain a strong strategic position in the Middle East, and a safe haven for long-term scheming."], "length": 4068, "dataset": "multi_news_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "b819834ec0fb0e44cd936945b9c0bc3df01098961e5c321c", "pred": " \n\nThe news reports highlight the growing ties between al-Qaeda and the Syrian opposition group, Jabhat al-Nusra, also known as the Victory Front.
