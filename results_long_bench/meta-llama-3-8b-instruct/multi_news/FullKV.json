NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Michael David Elliot, 40, was arrested in Kankakee Township in rural LaPorte County, Ind., and allegedly stole a total of four vehicles in his 24-hour run from the law. He was arraigned Tuesday in Indiana on auto theft charges. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The sheriff\u2019s department had been looking for a black 2002 Chevrolet Monte Carlo that was stolen from the area of Boyd Avenue and E. Lincolnway in LaPorte, authorities said. Deputy Jeffrey Wright said the vehicle\u2019s engine was on so it would warm up when it was taken. The sheriff\u2019s department was alerted to the theft at 6:16 p.m. ET, according to a Monday night news release. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Within minutes of learning of the theft, Deputy Slawek Czupryna spotted the stolen vehicle headed south on Boyd Boulevard in LaPorte. He attempted a traffic stop, but the driver didn\u2019t pull over. Instead, the driver fled, leading deputies on a short chase. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Stop Sticks were deployed just before 6:30 p.m., the sheriff\u2019s office said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cHe ran over a couple of sets of Stop Sticks that some of our sergeants had laid out, so his tires were going flat. He lost control of the vehicle and slid into a snowbank,\u201d Deputy Wright told 24 Hour News 8. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That snowbank was at the T-intersection of N 250 E between East Division and E 150 N in Kankakee Township, east of LaPorte. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Elliot then tried to climb out of the car\u2019s window, Wright said. Deputies Czupryna and Wright each grabbed one of Elliot\u2019s shoulders, pulled him from the car, laid him on the ground and handcuffed him. No one was hurt. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When asked what his name was, Elliot answered truthfully, Wright said. He said he asked Elliot if he was \u201c\u2018the Michael Elliot,\u201d and Elliot confirmed he was the escapee. Wright said he was surprised that Elliot didn\u2019t lie about his identity. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Wright then put Elliot into the back of his cruiser and took him to the LaPorte County Jail. Elliot is being held without bond on felony car theft and resisting charges. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Wright described Elliot was polite to officers, and quiet and emotionless during the ride to jail. Elliot looked tired, Wright said, like he had not slept in days. Wright said Elliot was wearing jeans that were too big and \u201ca couple of jackets.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Wright said authorities didn\u2019t know Elliot would be in their area \u2014 there was more concern he may be in the Shipshewana area \u2014 and that he did not expect the man he was chasing to be Elliot.

Elliot then got through a hole in the fencing system which, according to a former corrections officer, is made up of two 12-foot high, razor wire-topped fencing sections with a smaller, electrified fence in between them. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He then made a three-and-a-half mile trek into Ionia where he carjacked a woman, police said. The two then drove to the Elkhart, Ind. area. The woman escaped at a gas station there and he fled in her Jeep Liberty. That SUV was found early Monday morning in Shipshewana, Ind. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR LaPorte County, where Elliot was arrested, is west of Shipshewana. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Elliot was serving five life sentences in the Ionia Correctional Facility after being convicted of four 1993 murders.

Vickie Currie, her boyfriend Michael Tufnell, his cousin Bruce Squires Tufnell Jr. and fiancee Cathy Lave were killed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Charles and Paul Treece, and Tammy LaCross were with Elliot when the murders were committed.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The manhunt for 40-year- old Elliot started Sunday night, after he escaped from Ionia Correctional Facility in Michigan. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Elliot was convicted of four murders in 1993 and is serving five life sentences. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Michigan Department of Corrections Director Dan Heyns says officers realized Elliot was gone during a routine count at about 9 p.m. Sunday. After looking at surveillance tapes, they realized he escaped somewhere between 6 p.m. and 7 p.m. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Heyns says during the time of the escape, Elliot was dressed in a white kitchen uniform. It is unknown at this time how he got that uniform. Heyns says Elliot was not assigned to the kitchen. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR They believe it was the color of that uniform that had something to do with his ability to get by multiple security cameras and interior and perimeter fencing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After escaping, Elliot carjacked a woman using a box cutter. He held her hostage during the more than 100-mile drive to Elkhart County. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR They stopped for gas around 11 p.m. at a Marathon gas station near the intersection of SR 13 and CR 2, near Middlebury. The woman escaped Elliot at the station by asking for a cup for water, then locking herself in the bathroom and calling 911. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Elliot fled in the victim's car before police arrived. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Indiana State Police say the red Jeep Liberty he fled in was found in the 400 block of North State Street in Shipshewana Monday afternoon. A woman living in the neighborhood noticed the car matched the description of one given on the news, so she called police around 12:15 p.m. But, police say the car was seen in the area as early as 5:30 a.m. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"You can go a lot of places in seven hours,\" said Sgt. Ron Galaviz with the Indiana State Police. \"Especially if you have a mode of transportation. And, I'm not suggesting he does. But, again, we're looking for stolen vehicle reports or anything of that nature to help follow up on, to help us pursue on that trail.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Police went door-to-door looking for any signs of Elliot in Shipshewana. Westview Schools were notified of the situation and placed on lock down. Students were later dismissed, with a heavy police presence on site to ensure their safety. Police say all students were accounted for and the schools were thoroughly searched. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Indiana State Police say after searching the community, their hunt for Elliot in Shipshewana has been suspended and they have no new leads. They don't know if he is still in Michiana or has traveled elsewhere since abandoning the Jeep. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"What we're asking the public to do is to remain vigilant,\" Galaviz said. \"If you see something, say something. If something appears out of order, if a door seems unlocked, if a window is broken, don't investigate it. Call 911.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \\NBC affiliate WSMV in Nashville says early Monday morning, a woman thought she spotted Elliot at a Tennessee gas station. But, police say it was a false identification. Elliot has family in Tennessee. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He is described as a 5'8, 165-pound white male with brown hair and eyes. Elliot was wearing a blue and orange state prison uniform when he escaped, but he was last seen in black pants, a white t-shirt, white tennis shoes and a white beanie cap. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Elliot should be considered armed and dangerous. Anyone who comes in contact with him, should contact law enforcement immediately.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Results in Brief NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The California Whistleblower Protection Act (Whistleblower Act) empowers the California State Auditor's Office (State Auditor) to investigate and report on improper governmental activities by agencies and employees of the State. Under the Whistleblower Act, an improper governmental activity includes any action by a state agency or employee related to state government that violates a law; is economically wasteful; or involves gross misconduct, incompetence, or inefficiency. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR From July 1, 2017, through June 30, 2018, the State Auditor conducted investigative work on 1,481 cases. This report contains seven examples of investigations that substantiated improper governmental activities, including misuse of state time and inaccurate attendance records, economically wasteful activities, and misuse of government property. In addition, during the past year, the State Auditor issued nonpublic reports regarding nepotism, bad-faith hires, improper promotions, and other misconduct by executive management within two state entities. It provided these reports to those who could remediate the problems and ensure that the management teams involved did not retaliate against perceived whistleblowers. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR California State University, Fresno NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Two facilities operations employees at California State University, Fresno engaged in egregious and continued time and attendance abuse by taking extended breaks or leaving campus without accounting for their time. From 2013 through 2017, two employees failed to account for more than 5,100 hours of work, costing the State more than $111,000 in salary paid for work not performed. Furthermore, the employees were dishonest in their attempts to conceal their time and attendance abuse.

During this period, the LVN continued to receive her pay as a nurse even though she provided patient care only when she worked occasional overtime shifts, causing California Correctional Health Care Services (Correctional Health Care) to waste $10,500 in unnecessary salary payments. Furthermore, the nursing director's decision cost the State an additional $18,700 in unnecessary overtime payments that Correctional Health Care paid to other nurses to cover the LVN's originally assigned post, resulting in total waste of nearly $30,000.

In addition, the associate warden violated state law by choosing not to initiate any collection efforts after two internal audits in 2017 documented the error in pay and recommended the recovery of the overpayments.

(Photo: AP) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A California Department of Motor Vehicles employee slept thousands of hours on the job since 2014, a report released Tuesday from the state's auditor says. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The report estimates the employee slept three or more hours daily at her desk since February 2014, totaling over 2,200 hours of work time and costing more than $40,000. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The employee worked as a key data operator. Her duties included \"routine data entry for change of address and new vehicle ownership forms,\" the report says. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She processed less than half the documents that she was expected to \u2013 an average of 200 documents a day, when key data operators are expected to process more than 550, according to the report.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A supervisor reported waking the employee up \"three to four times each day,\" the report says.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Two employees either took extended breaks or left the premises over a five\u2011year period. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR One employee regularly left early from work over two years. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR One employee slept at her desk for extended periods of time during work hours. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u00bb A nursing director removed an LVN, who was her personal friend, from her assigned nursing position to perform duties typically performed by an office technician. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u00bb An official built an unauthorized structure on state property with the help of on\u2011duty staff under his command. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Results in Brief NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The California Whistleblower Protection Act (Whistleblower Act) empowers the California State Auditor's Office (State Auditor) to investigate and report on improper governmental activities by agencies and employees of the State. Under the Whistleblower Act, an improper governmental activity includes any action by a state agency or employee related to state government that violates a law; is economically wasteful; or involves gross misconduct, incompetence, or inefficiency. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR From July 1, 2017, through June 30, 2018, the State Auditor conducted investigative work on 1,481 cases. This report contains seven examples of investigations that substantiated improper governmental activities, including misuse of state time and inaccurate attendance records, economically wasteful activities, and misuse of government property. In addition, during the past year, the State Auditor issued nonpublic reports regarding nepotism, bad-faith hires, improper promotions, and other misconduct by executive management within two state entities. It provided these reports to those who could remediate the problems and ensure that the management teams involved did not retaliate against perceived whistleblowers. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR California State University, Fresno NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Two facilities operations employees at California State University, Fresno engaged in egregious and continued time and attendance abuse by taking extended breaks or leaving campus without accounting for their time. From 2013 through 2017, two employees failed to account for more than 5,100 hours of work, costing the State more than $111,000 in salary paid for work not performed. Furthermore, the employees were dishonest in their attempts to conceal their time and attendance abuse. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, Kern Valley State Prison NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For about two years, an employee at Kern Valley State Prison misused state time by regularly leaving work up to 45 minutes early as a result of inadequate supervision. We estimated that the employee failed to account for 312 hours of missed work time, costing the State nearly $9,000. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Department of Motor Vehicles NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A key data operator at the Department of Motor Vehicles failed to perform her essential duties over a period of nearly four years because she slept at her desk for extended periods of time during work hours. From February 2014 through December 2017, the employee misused more than 2,200 hours of work time as a result of sleeping on the job, costing the State more than $40,000. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR California Correctional Health Care Services NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR From May 2015 through July 2016, a director of nursing (nursing director) at a Southern California adult prison removed a licensed vocational nurse (LVN), who was her personal friend, from her assigned nursing position\u2014or post\u2014providing patient care and reassigned her to perform nurse scheduling duties typically performed by an office technician. During this period, the LVN continued to receive her pay as a nurse even though she provided patient care only when she worked occasional overtime shifts, causing California Correctional Health Care Services (Correctional Health Care) to waste $10,500 in unnecessary salary payments. Furthermore, the nursing director's decision cost the State an additional $18,700 in unnecessary overtime payments that Correctional Health Care paid to other nurses to cover the LVN's originally assigned post, resulting in total waste of nearly $30,000. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) overpaid a staff services analyst (analyst) at one of its prisons nearly $3,000 from July 2016 through March 2017. The analyst, her manager, an associate warden, and a personnel specialist all failed to follow CDCR procedure and the California Department of Human Resources' policy regarding inmate supervision pay, which resulted in the overpayments. In addition, the associate warden violated state law by choosing not to initiate any collection efforts after two internal audits in 2017 documented the error in pay and recommended the recovery of the overpayments. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR California State University, Dominguez Hills NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In March 2013, a manager at California State University, Dominguez Hills directed a member of his staff to purchase a Nissan-manufactured electric vehicle quick charger for nearly $7,000 before the manager had performed the due diligence necessary to ensure that the equipment was compatible with the energy resource plan for the campus. The quick charger has remained unused for five years, its warranty lapsed in 2014, and Nissan is no longer manufacturing replacement parts. As of February 2018, the campus told us it will be unable to install the quick charger before 2020 or 2021, if at all. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CAL FIRE) assistant chief misused state resources when he violated his rental agreement by building an unauthorized structure on state property using on-duty staff under his command. In 2016 the assistant chief built a 16-foot-by-20-foot structure with plumbing, electrical, and sewer connections in the backyard of the state residence he rented from CAL FIRE without written approval from CAL FIRE to build the structure as his rental agreement required. He also did not have approval from the Office of the State Fire Marshal, which is responsible for inspecting state\u2011owned buildings.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Islamist President Mohamed Mursi returned to work on Wednesday, a day after slipping out of the palace when it came under siege from protesters furious about his drive to push through a new constitution. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mahmoud Ghozlan, spokesman for the Brotherhood, was quoted on the group's Facebook page as saying the abuses were committed by groups that \"imagined they could shake legitimacy or impose their view with force\".\nPassage 2:\n* Rival factions hurl petrol bombs, stones outside palace NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR * Clinton calls for dialogue on contested constitution NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR * Vice president offers olive branch to opposition NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR By Yasmine Saleh and Marwa Awad NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR CAIRO, Dec 5 (Reuters) - Islamists fought protesters outside the Egyptian president's palace on Wednesday, while inside the building his deputy proposed a way to end a crisis over a draft constitution that has split the most populous Arab nation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Stones and petrol bombs flew between opposition protesters and supporters of President Mohamed Mursi who had flocked to the palace in response to a call from the Muslim Brotherhood. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Two Islamists were hit in the legs by what their friends said were bullets fired during the clashes in streets around the compound in northern Cairo. One of them was bleeding heavily. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A leftist group said Islamists had cut off the ear of one of its members. Medical sources said 23 people had been wounded in clashes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Riot police deployed between the two sides to try to stop the confrontations which flared after dark despite an attempt by Vice President Mahmoud Mekky to calm the political crisis. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He said amendments to disputed articles in the draft constitution could be agreed with the opposition. A written agreement could then be submitted to the next parliament, to be elected after a referendum on the constitution on Dec. 15. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"There must be consensus,\" he told a news conference, saying opposition demands had to be respected to reach a solution. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Facing the gravest crisis of his six-month-old tenure, Mursi has shown no sign of buckling, confident that Islamists can win the referendum and a parliamentary election to follow. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Many Egyptians yearn for an end to political upheaval that has scared off investors and tourists, damaging the economy. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Egypt's opposition coalition blamed Mursi for the violence around his palace and said it was ready for dialogue if the Islamist leader scrapped a decree he issued on Nov. 22 that gave him wide powers and shielded his decisions from judicial review. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We hold President Mursi and his government completely responsible for the violence happening in Egypt today,\" opposition coordinator Mohamed ElBaradei told a news conference. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR POLARISATION NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We are ready for dialogue if the constitutional decree is cancelled ... and the referendum on this constitution is postponed,\" he said of the document written by an Islamist-led assembly that the opposition says ignores its concerns. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Today what is happening in the Egyptian street, polarisation and division, is something that could and is actually drawing us to violence and could draw us to something worse,\" the former head of the U.N. nuclear watchdog added. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Opposition leaders have previously urged Mursi to retract the Nov. 22 decree, defer the referendum and agree to revise the constitution, but have not echoed calls from street protesters for his overthrow and the \"downfall of the regime\". NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mursi has said his decree was needed to prevent courts still full of judges appointed by ousted strongman Hosni Mubarak from derailing a constitution vital for Egypt's political transition. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Rival groups skirmished outside the presidential palace earlier on Wednesday. Islamist supporters of Mursi tore down tents erected by leftist foes, who had begun a sit-in there. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"They hit us and destroyed our tents. Are you happy, Mursi? Aren't we Egyptians too?\" asked protester Haitham Ahmed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mohamed Mohy, a pro-Mursi demonstrator who was filming the scene, said: \"We are here to support our president and his decisions and save our country from traitors and agents.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mekky said street mobilisation by both sides posed a \"real danger\" to Egypt. \"If we do not put a stop to this phenomenon right away ... where are we headed? We must calm down.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton weighed into Egypt's political debate, saying dialogue was urgently needed on the new constitution, which should \"respect the rights of all citizens\". NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR DIALOGUE NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Clinton and Mursi worked together last month to broker a truce between Israel and Hamas Islamists in the Gaza Strip. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It needs to be a two-way dialogue ... among Egyptians themselves about the constitutional process and the substance of the constitution,\" Clinton told a news conference in Brussels. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Washington is worried about rising Islamist power in Egypt, a staunch U.S. security partner under Mubarak, who preserved the U.S.-brokered peace treaty Cairo signed with Israel in 1979. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Muslim Brotherhood had summoned supporters to an open-ended demonstration at the presidential palace, a day after about 10,000 opposition protesters had encircled it for what organisers dubbed a \"last warning\" to Mursi. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The people want the downfall of the regime,\" they chanted, roaring the signature slogan of last year's anti-Mubarak revolt. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The \"last warning\" may turn out to be one of the last gasps for a disparate opposition that has little chance of scuttling next week's vote on the draft constitution. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR State institutions, with the partial exception of the judiciary, have mostly fallen in behind Mursi. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The army, the muscle behind all previous Egyptian presidents in the republic's six-decade history, has gone back to barracks, having apparently lost its appetite to intervene in politics. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In a bold move, Mursi sacked Mohamed Hussein Tantawi, the Mubarak-era army commander and defence minister, in August and removed the sweeping powers that the military council, which took over after Mubarak fell, had grabbed two months earlier. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The liberals, leftists, Christians, ex-Mubarak followers and others opposed to Mursi have yet to generate a mass movement or a grassroots political base to challenge the Brotherhood. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Investors have seized on hopes that Egypt's turbulent transition, which has buffeted the economy for two years, may soon head for calmer waters, sending stocks 1.6 percent higher after a 3.5 percent rally on Tuesday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Egypt has turned to the IMF for a $4.8 billion loan after the depletion of its foreign currency reserves. The government said on Wednesday the process was on track and its request would go to the IMF board as expected. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The board is due to review the facility on Dec. 19. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Elijah Zarwan, a fellow with the European Council on Foreign Relations, said that if Egypt was to find a compromise solution to its crisis, it would not be through slogans and blows. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It will be through quiet negotiation, not through duelling press conferences, street brawls, or civil strife.\"\nPassage 3:\nCAIRO (Reuters) - Islamists battled with protesters outside Egyptian President Mohamed Mursi's palace on Thursday, after his vice president suggested amendments could be agreed to the draft constitution that has divided the nation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Fires burned in the streets near the palace perimeter where opponents and supporters of Mursi threw stones and petrol bombs. Riot police tried to separate the two sides, but failed to halt fighting that extended from Wednesday into the early morning. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Residents, frustrated that police had not calmed the streets, set up makeshift road blocks nearby to check passers-by, scenes reminiscent of the popular uprising that toppled Mursi's autocratic predecessor Hosni Mubarak. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Medical sources said 211 people were wounded, some with gunshot wounds. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"No to dictatorship,\" Mursi's opponents chanted, while their rivals chanted: \"Defending Mursi is defending Islam.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mursi's opponents accused him of creating a new autocracy by awarding himself extraordinary powers in a decree on November 22 and were further angered when an Islamist-dominated assembly pushed through a draft constitution that opponents said did not properly represent the aspirations of the whole nation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The United States, worried about the stability of a state that has a peace deal with Israel and to which it gives $1.3 billion in military aid each year, called for dialogue. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Bidding to end the worst crisis since Mursi took office less than six months ago, Vice President Mahmoud Mekky said amendments to disputed articles in the constitution could be agreed with the opposition. A written agreement could then go to parliament, to be elected after a referendum on the constitution on December 15. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"There must be consensus,\" he told a news conference inside the presidential palace as fighting raged outside on Wednesday evening, saying opposition demands had to be respected. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR PROTESTS SPREAD NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Prime Minister Hisham Kandil called for calm to \"give the opportunity\" for efforts underway to start a national dialogue. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Protests spread to other cities, and offices of the Muslim Brotherhood's political party in Ismailia and Suez were torched. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But Mursi has shown no sign of buckling under pressure from protestors, confident that the Islamists, who have dominated both elections since Mubarak was overthrown in February 2011, can win the referendum and parliamentary election to follow. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On top of the support of the Brotherhood, which backed him for the presidency in the June election, Mursi may also be able to rely on a popular yearning for stability and economic revival after almost two years of political turmoil. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Egypt's opposition coalition blamed Mursi for the violence and said it was ready for dialogue if the Islamist leader scrapped the decree that gave him wide powers and shielded his decisions from judicial review. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Today what is happening in the Egyptian street, polarization and division, is something that could and is actually drawing us to violence and could draw us to something worse,\" opposition coordinator Mohamed ElBaradei said on Wednesday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We are ready for dialogue if the constitutional decree is canceled ... and the referendum on this constitution is postponed,\" he told a news conference. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But liberals, leftists, Christians, ex-Mubarak followers and others opposed to Mursi have yet to generate a mass movement or a grassroots base to challenge the Brotherhood. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'REAL DANGER' NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Opposition leaders have previously urged Mursi to retract the decree, defer the referendum and agree to revise the constitution, but have not echoed calls from street protesters for his overthrow and the \"downfall of the regime\". NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mursi has said his decree was needed to prevent courts still full of judges appointed by Mubarak from derailing a constitution vital for Egypt's political transition. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mekky said street mobilization by both sides posed a \"real danger\" to Egypt. \"If we do not put a stop to this phenomenon right away ... where are we headed?

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Clinton and Mursi worked together last month to broker a truce between Israel and Hamas Islamists in the Gaza Strip. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR British Foreign Secretary William Hague called for restraint on all sides. He said Egypt's authorities had to make progress on the transition in an \"inclusive manner\" and urged dialogue. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Both Islamists and their opponents have staged big shows of strength on the streets since Mursi's controversial decree, each bringing out tens of thousands of people. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR State institutions, with the partial exception of the judiciary, have mostly fallen in behind Mursi. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The army, the muscle behind all previous Egyptian presidents in the republic's six-decade history, has gone back to barracks, having apparently lost its appetite to intervene in politics.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Egypt's opposition coalition blamed Mursi for the violence around his palace and said it was ready for dialogue if the Islamist leader scrapped a decree he issued on Nov. 22 that gave him wide powers and shielded his decisions from judicial review. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We hold President Mursi and his government completely responsible for the violence happening in Egypt today,\" opposition coordinator Mohamed ElBaradei told a news conference. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR POLARISATION NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We are ready for dialogue if the constitutional decree is cancelled ... and the referendum on this constitution is postponed,\" he said of the document written by an Islamist-led assembly that the opposition says ignores its concerns. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Today what is happening in the Egyptian street, polarisation and division, is something that could and is actually drawing us to violence and could draw us to something worse,\" the former head of the U.N. nuclear watchdog added. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Opposition leaders have previously urged Mursi to retract the Nov. 22 decree, defer the referendum and agree to revise the constitution, but have not echoed calls from street protesters for his overthrow and the \"downfall of the regime\". NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mursi has said his decree was needed to prevent courts still full of judges appointed by ousted strongman Hosni Mubarak from derailing a constitution vital for Egypt's political transition. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Rival groups skirmished outside the presidential palace earlier on Wednesday. Islamist supporters of Mursi tore down tents erected by leftist foes, who had begun a sit-in there. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"They hit us and destroyed our tents. Are you happy, Mursi? Aren't we Egyptians too?\" asked protester Haitham Ahmed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mohamed Mohy, a pro-Mursi demonstrator who was filming the scene, said: \"We are here to support our president and his decisions and save our country from traitors and agents.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mekky said street mobilisation by both sides posed a \"real danger\" to Egypt. \"If we do not put a stop to this phenomenon right away ... where are we headed? We must calm down.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton weighed into Egypt's political debate, saying dialogue was urgently needed on the new constitution, which should \"respect the rights of all citizens\". NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR DIALOGUE NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Clinton and Mursi worked together last month to broker a truce between Israel and Hamas Islamists in the Gaza Strip. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It needs to be a two-way dialogue ... among Egyptians themselves about the constitutional process and the substance of the constitution,\" Clinton told a news conference in Brussels. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Washington is worried about rising Islamist power in Egypt, a staunch U.S. security partner under Mubarak, who preserved the U.S.-brokered peace treaty Cairo signed with Israel in 1979. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Muslim Brotherhood had summoned supporters to an open-ended demonstration at the presidential palace, a day after about 10,000 opposition protesters had encircled it for what organisers dubbed a \"last warning\" to Mursi. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The people want the downfall of the regime,\" they chanted, roaring the signature slogan of last year's anti-Mubarak revolt. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The \"last warning\" may turn out to be one of the last gasps for a disparate opposition that has little chance of scuttling next week's vote on the draft constitution. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR State institutions, with the partial exception of the judiciary, have mostly fallen in behind Mursi. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The army, the muscle behind all previous Egyptian presidents in the republic's six-decade history, has gone back to barracks, having apparently lost its appetite to intervene in politics. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In a bold move, Mursi sacked Mohamed Hussein Tantawi, the Mubarak-era army commander and defence minister, in August and removed the sweeping powers that the military council, which took over after Mubarak fell, had grabbed two months earlier. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The liberals, leftists, Christians, ex-Mubarak followers and others opposed to Mursi have yet to generate a mass movement or a grassroots political base to challenge the Brotherhood. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Investors have seized on hopes that Egypt's turbulent transition, which has buffeted the economy for two years, may soon head for calmer waters, sending stocks 1.6 percent higher after a 3.5 percent rally on Tuesday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Egypt has turned to the IMF for a $4.8 billion loan after the depletion of its foreign currency reserves. The government said on Wednesday the process was on track and its request would go to the IMF board as expected. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The board is due to review the facility on Dec. 19. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Elijah Zarwan, a fellow with the European Council on Foreign Relations, said that if Egypt was to find a compromise solution to its crisis, it would not be through slogans and blows. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It will be through quiet negotiation, not through duelling press conferences, street brawls, or civil strife.\"\nPassage 3:\nCAIRO (Reuters) - Islamists battled with protesters outside Egyptian President Mohamed Mursi's palace on Thursday, after his vice president suggested amendments could be agreed to the draft constitution that has divided the nation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Fires burned in the streets near the palace perimeter where opponents and supporters of Mursi threw stones and petrol bombs. Riot police tried to separate the two sides, but failed to halt fighting that extended from Wednesday into the early morning. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Residents, frustrated that police had not calmed the streets, set up makeshift road blocks nearby to check passers-by, scenes reminiscent of the popular uprising that toppled Mursi's autocratic predecessor Hosni Mubarak. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Medical sources said 211 people were wounded, some with gunshot wounds. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"No to dictatorship,\" Mursi's opponents chanted, while their rivals chanted: \"Defending Mursi is defending Islam.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mursi's opponents accused him of creating a new autocracy by awarding himself extraordinary powers in a decree on November 22 and were further angered when an Islamist-dominated assembly pushed through a draft constitution that opponents said did not properly represent the aspirations of the whole nation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The United States, worried about the stability of a state that has a peace deal with Israel and to which it gives $1.3 billion in military aid each year, called for dialogue. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Bidding to end the worst crisis since Mursi took office less than six months ago, Vice President Mahmoud Mekky said amendments to disputed articles in the constitution could be agreed with the opposition. A written agreement could then go to parliament, to be elected after a referendum on the constitution on December 15. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"There must be consensus,\" he told a news conference inside the presidential palace as fighting raged outside on Wednesday evening, saying opposition demands had to be respected. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR PROTESTS SPREAD NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Prime Minister Hisham Kandil called for calm to \"give the opportunity\" for efforts underway to start a national dialogue. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Protests spread to other cities, and offices of the Muslim Brotherhood's political party in Ismailia and Suez were torched. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But Mursi has shown no sign of buckling under pressure from protestors, confident that the Islamists, who have dominated both elections since Mubarak was overthrown in February 2011, can win the referendum and parliamentary election to follow. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On top of the support of the Brotherhood, which backed him for the presidency in the June election, Mursi may also be able to rely on a popular yearning for stability and economic revival after almost two years of political turmoil. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Egypt's opposition coalition blamed Mursi for the violence and said it was ready for dialogue if the Islamist leader scrapped the decree that gave him wide powers and shielded his decisions from judicial review. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Today what is happening in the Egyptian street, polarization and division, is something that could and is actually drawing us to violence and could draw us to something worse,\" opposition coordinator Mohamed ElBaradei said on Wednesday.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR British Foreign Secretary William Hague called for restraint on all sides. He said Egypt's authorities had to make progress on the transition in an \"inclusive manner\" and urged dialogue. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Both Islamists and their opponents have staged big shows of strength on the streets since Mursi's controversial decree, each bringing out tens of thousands of people.

Write a one-page summary of all news. \n\nNews:\nPassage 1:\nBERLIN (AP) \u2014 German prosecutors said Wednesday they have indicted two former Nazi SS guards in their 90s on charges of being accessories to murder while they worked at a World War II concentration camp. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Both men served as guards at the Stutthof concentration camp, located near what is now the Polish city of Gdansk, Dortmund prosecutor Andreas Brendel told The Associated Press. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The indictments were filed against a 93-year-old man from Borken who served in Stutthof from June 1942 to September 1944 and a 92-year-old man from Wuppertal who was there from June 1944 to May 1945. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The charges were filed last week at the state court in Muenster but only announced Wednesday because the defendants first had to be notified. Both deny they had any knowledge of killings at the camp, Brendel said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR About 65,000 people died at Stutthof. Some were put to death in gas chambers or shot, while others died from malnutrition or froze to death. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The men, who have not been named, both served as guards and also watched over prisoners who were taken outside the camp to work. During the time they were at Stutthof, hundreds of killings occurred. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Members of the SS killed more than 100 Polish prisoners and some 77 Soviet prisoners of war in the camp's gas chamber in 1944. An unknown number of Jews also were gassed there in late 1944. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Between June 1944 and April 1945, SS members also killed several hundred Jews by shooting them in the back of the neck. SS-physicians and nurses at Stutthof killed more than 140 prisoners, many of them Jewish women and children, by injecting their hearts with gasoline and the chemical compound phenol from late 1942 until late 1944. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The prosecutors assume that the accused were aware of the different killing methods ...and that such a multitude of people could have only been killed with such regularity because the victims were guarded by helpers like them,\" the court wrote in a statement issued Wednesday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The two men therefore willingly supported several hundreds of killings of camp inmates in their function as guards, the statement added. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR German prosecutors in recent years have pursued Nazi suspects under new legal reasoning that, even without evidence of a specific crime, they can be prosecuted if they helped camps operate.\nPassage 2:\nIn Judith Meisel\u2019s last image of her mother, Mina, she is standing outside a gas chamber at the Stutthof concentration camp in Poland, awaiting the same fate that befell 65,000 other prisoners there. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This summer, as she has countless times before, the St. Louis Park resident relived the experience in wrenching detail, but this time for a set of German prosecutors who, aided by Minnesota FBI agents, were racing to bring to justice the few Nazis still alive who can be linked to World War II-era atrocities. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Now Meisel, 88, knows her assistance paid off: German authorities this month indicted two ex-guards on charges of being accessories to many of the murders at Stutthof, located near what is now the Polish city of Gdansk. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Under German law, Meisel could join prosecutors as a \u201cco-plaintiff\u201d in the case. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In June, Meisel stunned the Germans, and her family, when she identified one of the ex-guards, Johann Rehbogen, as a teenage SS officer who taunted her and other female prisoners as they undressed each morning. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The charges, made possible by new German legal guidance allowing the prosecution of former Nazis who can\u2019t be tied to specific killings, represent a new and vital chapter for survivors like Meisel. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Holocaust survivor Judy Meisel held a photo of her parents Osser Beker and Mika Beker that was taken around 1938. Judy's mother died in the gas chamber at Stutthof concentration camp on the Baltic coast in late 1944 or early 1945. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cI understand that the person who has been indicted was a young man at the time,\u201d Meisel said. \u201cStill, the questions he must answer are an important part of this story.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR How, for example, did he take such a gruesome job at such a young age? What did he think when he watched women and children being killed on an industrial scale? How has he explained his past to his family and friends? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Meisel awaits any details the 94-year-old Rehbogen can provide, even if it means she must again relive the horror of her years inside the camp. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cThis process of seeking answers and finding justice for my mother gives new meaning to my life,\u201d Meisel said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR What comes next? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Prosecutors in Dortmund indicted Rehbogen and Harry Paul Fritz Schulz, 92, on charges stemming from their tenures at the camp from 1942 to 1944. Since 2011, German authorities have been pursuing cases against Nazis whom they believe they can prove helped operate concentration camps during the war. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A Dortmund prosecutor told the Associated Press this month that both men denied knowing anything about the killings at the camp. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Meisel\u2019s description of life in the camp \u2014 and law enforcement interviews with other Americans identified as Stutthof survivors \u2014 are essential for prosecutors to challenge those denials. In June, Meisel instantly recognized a photo of Rehbogen, whom she and other prisoners called \u201cMeydele\u201d for his girlish looks, and said he was among those who taunted and beat prisoners. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cornelius Nestler, a German professor and lawyer who has represented Holocaust survivors in similar cases, found Meisel online and connected her with German authorities who weren\u2019t sure how many, if any, Stutthof survivors were still alive. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Nestler told the Star Tribune in an e-mail that the defendants will have an opportunity to challenge the indictment and will likely be evaluated by medical experts for their fitness to stand trial. Nestler said that the trial could commence next summer if the defendants are deemed healthy enough. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Meisel, he said, could \u201ctake the stand as a witness,\u201d or at least observe the proceedings. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u2018Important lessons\u2019 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Meisel\u2019s son, Michael Cohen, said he\u2019s not sure if his mother would travel to Germany or participate in the prosecution from afar. German authorities also named witnesses from Ohio, New Jersey, New York and Florida. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The charges came as a surprise to the family, Cohen said, and represented a determination not to \u201csimply move aside and forget about\u201d those responsible. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cohen, a Minneapolis attorney, said news of the charges brought back new, vivid memories for his mother that include witnessing camp inmates killed by injections administered by Stutthof doctors. Meisel has since spent much of the month thinking of her mother and sister Rachel, who was forced on a death march away from the camp with her in early 1945 that they both escaped. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cohen said Meisel has described her mother as a woman of forgiveness, but is still unsure how she would respond to the charges. \u201cShe\u2019s very interested in what comes next,\u201d Cohen said this week. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He also said the wave of emotions has taken its toll on his mother. As an activist, she has told her story to audiences across the country, but in the days since learning of the indictments, Meisel has privately revisited what it meant to be a Stutthof inmate. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While she still has nightmares, Meisel said she welcomes any chance to tell her story \u201cfor the important lessons it teaches about tolerance and racism.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She said she cannot forget the message from some of her fellow prisoners: \u201cDon\u2019t let us die without you mentioning what happened to us.\u201d\n\n\nNow, write a one-page summary of all the news.\n\nSummary:", "input": "", "context": "Passage 1:\nBERLIN (AP) \u2014 German prosecutors said Wednesday they have indicted two former Nazi SS guards in their 90s on charges of being accessories to murder while they worked at a World War II concentration camp.

SS-physicians and nurses at Stutthof killed more than 140 prisoners, many of them Jewish women and children, by injecting their hearts with gasoline and the chemical compound phenol from late 1942 until late 1944. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The prosecutors assume that the accused were aware of the different killing methods ...and that such a multitude of people could have only been killed with such regularity because the victims were guarded by helpers like them,\" the court wrote in a statement issued Wednesday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The two men therefore willingly supported several hundreds of killings of camp inmates in their function as guards, the statement added. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR German prosecutors in recent years have pursued Nazi suspects under new legal reasoning that, even without evidence of a specific crime, they can be prosecuted if they helped camps operate.\nPassage 2:\nIn Judith Meisel\u2019s last image of her mother, Mina, she is standing outside a gas chamber at the Stutthof concentration camp in Poland, awaiting the same fate that befell 65,000 other prisoners there. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This summer, as she has countless times before, the St. Louis Park resident relived the experience in wrenching detail, but this time for a set of German prosecutors who, aided by Minnesota FBI agents, were racing to bring to justice the few Nazis still alive who can be linked to World War II-era atrocities. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Now Meisel, 88, knows her assistance paid off: German authorities this month indicted two ex-guards on charges of being accessories to many of the murders at Stutthof, located near what is now the Polish city of Gdansk. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Under German law, Meisel could join prosecutors as a \u201cco-plaintiff\u201d in the case. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In June, Meisel stunned the Germans, and her family, when she identified one of the ex-guards, Johann Rehbogen, as a teenage SS officer who taunted her and other female prisoners as they undressed each morning. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The charges, made possible by new German legal guidance allowing the prosecution of former Nazis who can\u2019t be tied to specific killings, represent a new and vital chapter for survivors like Meisel. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Holocaust survivor Judy Meisel held a photo of her parents Osser Beker and Mika Beker that was taken around 1938. Judy's mother died in the gas chamber at Stutthof concentration camp on the Baltic coast in late 1944 or early 1945. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cI understand that the person who has been indicted was a young man at the time,\u201d Meisel said. \u201cStill, the questions he must answer are an important part of this story.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR How, for example, did he take such a gruesome job at such a young age? What did he think when he watched women and children being killed on an industrial scale? How has he explained his past to his family and friends? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Meisel awaits any details the 94-year-old Rehbogen can provide, even if it means she must again relive the horror of her years inside the camp. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u201cThis process of seeking answers and finding justice for my mother gives new meaning to my life,\u201d Meisel said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR What comes next? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Prosecutors in Dortmund indicted Rehbogen and Harry Paul Fritz Schulz, 92, on charges stemming from their tenures at the camp from 1942 to 1944. Since 2011, German authorities have been pursuing cases against Nazis whom they believe they can prove helped operate concentration camps during the war. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A Dortmund prosecutor told the Associated Press this month that both men denied knowing anything about the killings at the camp. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Meisel\u2019s description of life in the camp \u2014 and law enforcement interviews with other Americans identified as Stutthof survivors \u2014 are essential for prosecutors to challenge those denials. In June, Meisel instantly recognized a photo of Rehbogen, whom she and other prisoners called \u201cMeydele\u201d for his girlish looks, and said he was among those who taunted and beat prisoners. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cornelius Nestler, a German professor and lawyer who has represented Holocaust survivors in similar cases, found Meisel online and connected her with German authorities who weren\u2019t sure how many, if any, Stutthof survivors were still alive. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Nestler told the Star Tribune in an e-mail that the defendants will have an opportunity to challenge the indictment and will likely be evaluated by medical experts for their fitness to stand trial. Nestler said that the trial could commence next summer if the defendants are deemed healthy enough. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Meisel, he said, could \u201ctake the stand as a witness,\u201d or at least observe the proceedings. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \u2018Important lessons\u2019 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Meisel\u2019s son, Michael Cohen, said he\u2019s not sure if his mother would travel to Germany or participate in the prosecution from afar. German authorities also named witnesses from Ohio, New Jersey, New York and Florida. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The charges came as a surprise to the family, Cohen said, and represented a determination not to \u201csimply move aside and forget about\u201d those responsible. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cohen, a Minneapolis attorney, said news of the charges brought back new, vivid memories for his mother that include witnessing camp inmates killed by injections administered by Stutthof doctors. Meisel has since spent much of the month thinking of her mother and sister Rachel, who was forced on a death march away from the camp with her in early 1945 that they both escaped. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cohen said Meisel has described her mother as a woman of forgiveness, but is still unsure how she would respond to the charges. \u201cShe\u2019s very interested in what comes next,\u201d Cohen said this week. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He also said the wave of emotions has taken its toll on his mother. As an activist, she has told her story to audiences across the country, but in the days since learning of the indictments, Meisel has privately revisited what it meant to be a Stutthof inmate. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While she still has nightmares, Meisel said she welcomes any chance to tell her story \u201cfor the important lessons it teaches about tolerance and racism.\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She said she cannot forget the message from some of her fellow prisoners: \u201cDon\u2019t let us die without you mentioning what happened to us.\u201d\n", "answers": ["Judith Meisel says that when she was a teenager in the Stutthof concentration camp in western Poland, other prisoners told her: \"Don't let us die without you mentioning what happened to us.\" The 88-year-old Minnesota resident has not forgotten: Her testimony helped German authorities indict two former guards from the camp where 65,000 people, including Meisel's mother, died, the Minneapolis Star Tribune reports. She identified one former guard, 94-year-old Johann Rehbogen, as the young SS officer who would taunt female prisoners as they undressed. Prosecutors say the men can't be tied to specific murders, but their work as guards made the killings possible. Meisel\u2014who escaped along with her sister when inmates were sent on a \"death march\" away from the camp in 1945\u2014says she is willing to relive her horrific experiences to help prosecutors. \"This process of seeking answers and finding justice for my mother gives new meaning to my life,\" she says. The two former guards have been charged as accessories to murder, the AP reports. They deny any knowledge of killings at the camp, where thousands were starved to death or froze. Prosecutors say prisoners were also gassed to death, shot, and killed with lethal injections. Authorities say Meisel and several other Stutthof survivors in the US could be called as witnesses if the former guards are deemed healthy enough to stand trial.
