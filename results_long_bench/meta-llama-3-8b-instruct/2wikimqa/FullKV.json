Henry was the son of Herman I, count of Gleiberg. Henry was a follower of Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor. He had lands in the southeastern Eifel and on the Moselle River.\nMost of the holdings of Hermann II, Count Palatine fell back to the emperor, when Hermann died without successor. The emperor named Henry count palatine of the Rhine and during the emperor's trip to Italy tasked Henry to hold interim judicial councils. Henry married Herman's widow, Adelaide of Weimar-Orlam\u00fcnde (d. 1100). From this marriage, Henry may have taken control over some of her holdings along the Moselle. As a consequence, the geographic center of the palatinate moved towards the south.\nWith his wife, Adelaide, Henry founded the Maria Laach Abbey. He was succeeded by his stepson, Siegfried of Ballenstedt.\nPassage 3:\nHermann II, Count Palatine of Lotharingia\nHermann II (born 1049; died Dalhem, 20 September 1085), Count Palatine of Lotharingia 1064\u20131085. He was count in the Ruhrgau and the Zulpichgau, as well as a count of Brabant.\n\nLife\nAccording to Egon Kimpen he was the son of Henry I of Lotharingia (\u2020 1061) and Mathild of Verdun (\u2020 1060), daughter of Gozelo I of Lotharingia, but the basis for this has been questioned. However, if that is the case, his maternal uncle was Pope Stephen IX. Until 1064, young Hermann was under the guardianship of Anno II, Archbishop of Cologne, who significantly reduced Hermann's territorial power.\nIn 1080 he married Adelaide of Weimar-Orlam\u00fcnde (\u2020 1100), widow of Adalbert II, Count of Ballenstedt.

His elder brother was Joseph Charles, Count Palatine of Sulzbach.\n\nLife\nAfter the death of his elder brother Joseph Charles, John Christian Joseph became the eventual designated heir of the Electoral Palatine. In 1732 he succeeded his father as Count Palatine of Sulzbach, but died in Sulzbach in 1733 before inheriting the Palatinate.\nCharles III Philip, Elector Palatine, a member of the Palatine Neuburg line of Wittelsbach failed to produce a legitimate male heir, and his brothers also. By 1716 it was evident that the Neuburg line would become extinct and that the Sulzbach branch would succeed them.\n\nMarriage\nHe married twice:\n\nMarie Anne Henri\u00ebtte Leopoldine de La Tour d'Auvergne (24 October 1708 \u2013 28 July 1728), daughter of Francois Egon de la Tour d'Auvergne, Prince of Auvergne, and had the following children:Charles Theodore (11 December 1724 \u2013 16 February 1799); became Elector Palatine in 1742, and Elector of Bavaria in 1777\nMaria Anne (30 May 1728 \u2013 25 June 1728)Eleonore Philippina Christina Sophia of Hesse-Rotenburg  (1712-1759); married on 1731 but had no issue.\n\n\n== Ancestry ==\nPassage 5:\nPhilip William August, Count Palatine of Neuburg\nPhilip William August, Count Palatine of Neuburg (born 19 November 1668 in Neuburg an der Donau; died: 5 April 1693 in Z\u00e1kupy (German: Reichstadt)) was a  Prince and Count Palatine of Neuburg.\n\nLife\nPhilip William August was the 13th from a total of 17 children of Elector Palatine Philip William (1615-1690) from his second marriage to Elisabeth Amalie (1635-1709), a daughter of Landgrave George II of Hesse-Darmstadt.\nHis oldest sister, Eleonor Magdalene married Emperor Leopold I in 1676.  In August 1689, after he had visited his brother in Breslau and his sister in Vienna, Philip William began his Grand Tour to Italy.\nPhilip William August chose a secular career and entered into active military service.

He was the son of Hezzelin I, Count in Z\u00fclpichgau, and a member of the Ezzonid dynasty. Historians have given several nicknames to Heinrich: Furiosus (the Violent/the Insane), because he murdered his wife, and Monachus (the Monk), because he was confined into an abbey to treat his insanity.\n\nLife\nHenry was the son of Hezzelin I and his unnamed wife, who was probably a daughter of  Conrad I of Carinthia.Around 1048 Henry married Mathilda of Verdun (born abt 1025, died 27 July 1060), daughter of Duke Gozelo of Lotharingia, and sister of pope Stephen IX.\nHe received the Mosellan castle of Cochem from his niece, Queen Richeza of Poland. He was elected as successor for the German kingdom during Emperor Henry III's illness.\nShortly after 1058, Henry began to show signs of insanity, for which he was confined to the abbey of Gorze. He escaped however, and thinking that his wife Matilda had been unfaithful to him, he killed her (27 July 1060). Henry then was definitely enclosed into the abbey of Echternach, where he died in 1061. His office and counties were confiscated by Anno II, archbishop of Cologne, who became the guardian of their only son, the later count palatine Hermann II (1064-1085).\nPassage 7:\nRudolph II, Count Palatine of T\u00fcbingen\nRudolph II, Count Palatine of T\u00fcbingen (died 1 November 1247) was Count Palatine of T\u00fcbingen and Vogt of Sindelfingen.  He was the younger son of Rudolph I and his wife Matilda of Gleiberg, heiress of Giessen.\n\nLife\nRudolph II inherited the County Palatine of T\u00fcbingen when his elder brother Hugo III died in 1216.  From 1224 onwards, he is described as Count Palatine in many imperial documents, while his younger brother William is merely styled as Count.  Rudolph II supported Bebenhausen Abbey, which his parents had founded. \nNext to his father, Rudolph II is the second most mentioned Count Palatine of T\u00fcbingen in imperial documents, mostly in documents by King Henry (VII) of Germany, the son of Emperor Frederick II, who had been elected King of Germany in 1220, at the age of 8.  Frederick II spent much of his time in Italy, leaving his ancestral Swabia in the hands of his son.  Later, in 1232, Henry revolted against his father, and did everything in his power to win the Swabian nobility over to his side.  Rudolph II appears to have been among the noblemen who sided with Henry VII, at least, he is mentioned in 10 different documents of Henry VII and never by Frederick II.  Considering Rudolph's energetic character, one can assume that he intended to use the conflict between Henry VII and Frederick II to expand his own power and aim at an independent position.Swabian noblemen, including Rudolph II and his brother William, Count Hartmann I of W\u00fcrttemberg and a Count of Dillingen, visited Henry VII in Worms on 8 January 1224.  They met Margrave Herman V of Baden was also present, as was Eberhard, S\u00e9n\u00e9chal of Waldburg and councillor and former guardian of Henry VII in Oppenheim on 5 April 1227 and in Hagenau on 1 May.  In the same year, Rudolph met Duke Louis I of Bavaria, who was an imperial vicar and Conrad of Winterstetten, who was imperial cup-bearer and also a councilor of Henry VII.  He met the Lords of Neuffen and the imperial marshal Anselm of Justingen in Ulm on 23 February 1228.  On 31 August 1228, Rudolph II appears, together with Margrave Herman V of Baden, Count Henry of Wirtemberg, a Count of Dillingen, Conrad of Weinsperg and the councillors mentioned above, as witnesses of a deed in which King henry VII confirms the privileges of Adelber Abbey in Esslingen.  Later that year, Rudolph II appeared as a witness in four deed by Duke Louis I of Bavaria and Bishop Ekbert of Bamberg, together with, among others, Margrave Herman V of Baden, Count Ulrich and Eberhard of Helfenstein, Counts Eberhard and Otto of Eberstein, Count Gottfried of Hohenlohe, and two councilors.Rudolph II stood at the head of a delegation of eight Swabian counts, among them Albert IV of Habsburg, Frederick IV of Zollern and a Count of Eberstein, at the Imperial Diet in Worms on 29 April 1231.  On 22 November 1231, Rudolph II and his brother William met Counts Albert of Rottenburg, Ulrich of Hefenstein and Eberhard of Walpurg at Henry VII's castle in Ulm.  On 31 December 1231, Rudolph witnessed a deed benefiting Neresheim Abbey in Wimpfen, together with Duke Conrad I of Teck and Margrave Hermann V of Baden.  The last time Rudolph II witnessed a deed of Henry VII was on 4 June 1233 in Esslingen, again with his brother William.In 1235, Pope Gregory IX called on the princes of the empire to organize a new crusade into the Holy Land, to render assistance to the beleaguered church there.  Rudolph II is the only Swabian nobleman named in this call to arms; whether he actually went to the Holy Land is unknown.  The fact that he is not mentioned in any deed between 1235 and 1243 suggests that he may have been absent for an extended period.  In particular, no mention is made of his position in the struggle between King Conrad IV of Germany and anti-King Henry Raspe IV, which is remarkable, since this struggle took place mainly in Swabia.  However, a deed in favour of Bebenhausen Abbey which the papal legate made at Rudolph II's request in the army camp outside Ulm on 28 January 1247, suggests that he supported Henry Raspe.\n\nFamily\nThe name of Rudolph II's wife has not been preserved.  She was a daughter of a Margrave Henry from the House of Ronsberg and Udilhild of Gammertingen. They had the following children:\n\nHugo IV, Count Palatine of T\u00fcbingen\nRudolf III of Scheer (d. 12 May 1277), Count of T\u00fcbingen-Herrenberg\nUlrich\nMathilda, married Burchard II, Count of Hohenberg (d. 14 July 1253, struck by lightning).

{"prompt": "Answer the question based on the given passages. Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\nBrian Kennedy (gallery director)\nBrian Patrick Kennedy (born 5 November 1961) is an Irish-born art museum director who has worked in Ireland and Australia, and now lives and works in the United States.  He was the director of the Peabody Essex Museum in Salem for 17 months, resigning December 31, 2020. He was the director of the Toledo Museum of Art in Ohio from 2010 to 2019. He was the director of the Hood Museum of Art from 2005 to 2010, and the National Gallery of Australia (Canberra) from 1997 to 2004.\n\nCareer\nBrian Kennedy currently lives and works in the United States after leaving Australia in 2005 to direct the Hood Museum of Art at Dartmouth College. In October 2010 he became the ninth Director of the Toledo Museum of Art. On 1 July 2019, he succeeded Dan Monroe as the executive director and CEO of the Peabody Essex Museum.\n\nEarly life and career in Ireland\nKennedy was born in Dublin and attended Clonkeen College. He received B.A. (1982), M.A. (1985) and PhD (1989) degrees from University College-Dublin, where he studied both art history and history.\nHe worked in the Irish Department of Education (1982), the European Commission, Brussels (1983), and in Ireland at the Chester Beatty Library (1983\u201385), Government Publications Office (1985\u201386), and Department of Finance (1986\u201389). He married Mary Fiona Carlin in 1988.He was Assistant Director at the National Gallery of Ireland in Dublin from 1989 to 1997. He was Chair of the Irish Association of Art Historians from 1996 to 1997, and of the Council of Australian Art Museum Directors from 2001 to 2003. In September 1997 he became Director of the National Gallery of Australia.\n\nNational Gallery of Australia (NGA)\nKennedy expanded the traveling exhibitions and loans program throughout Australia, arranged for several major shows of Australian art abroad, increased the number of exhibitions at the museum itself and oversaw the development of an extensive multi-media site.  Although he oversaw several years of the museum's highest ever annual visitation, he discontinued the emphasis of his predecessor, Betty Churcher, on showing \"blockbuster\" exhibitions.\nDuring his directorship, the NGA gained government support for improving the building and significant private donations and corporate sponsorship. However, the initial design for the building proved controversial generating a public dispute with the original architect on moral rights grounds.  As a result, the project was not delivered during Dr Kennedy's tenure, with a significantly altered design completed some years later.  Private funding supported two acquisitions of British art, including David Hockney's A Bigger Grand Canyon in 1999, and Lucian Freud's After C\u00e9zanne in 2001. Kennedy built on the established collections at the museum by acquiring the Holmgren-Spertus collection of Indonesian textiles; the Kenneth Tyler collection of editioned prints, screens, multiples and unique proofs; and the Australian Print Workshop Archive. He was also notable for campaigning for the construction of a new \"front\" entrance to the Gallery, facing King Edward Terrace, which was completed in 2010 (see reference to the building project above).\nKennedy's cancellation of the \"Sensation exhibition\" (scheduled at the NGA from 2 June 2000 to 13 August 2000) was controversial, and seen by some as censorship. He claimed that the decision was due to the exhibition being \"too close to the market\" implying that a national cultural institution cannot exhibit the private collection of a speculative art investor. However, there were other exhibitions at the NGA during his tenure, which could have raised similar concerns. The exhibition featured the privately owned Young British Artists works belonging to Charles Saatchi and attracted large attendances in London and Brooklyn. Its most controversial work was Chris Ofili's The Holy Virgin Mary, a painting which used elephant dung and was accused of being blasphemous. The then-mayor of New York, Rudolph Giuliani, campaigned against the exhibition, claiming it was \"Catholic-bashing\" and an \"aggressive, vicious, disgusting attack on religion.\" In November 1999, Kennedy cancelled the exhibition and stated that the events in New York had \"obscured discussion of the artistic merit of the works of art\". He has said that it \"was the toughest decision of my professional life, so far.\"Kennedy was also repeatedly questioned on his management of a range of issues during the Australian Government's Senate Estimates process - particularly on the NGA's occupational health and safety record and concerns about the NGA's twenty-year-old air-conditioning system. The air-conditioning was finally renovated in 2003. Kennedy announced in 2002 that he would not seek extension of his contract beyond 2004, accepting a seven-year term as had his two predecessors.He became a joint Irish-Australian citizen in 2003.\n\nToledo Museum of Art\nThe Toledo Museum of Art is known for its exceptional collections of European and American paintings and sculpture, glass, antiquities, artist books, Japanese prints and netsuke. The museum offers free admission and is recognized for its historical leadership in the field of art education.  During his tenure, Kennedy has focused the museum's art education efforts on visual literacy, which he defines as \"learning to read, understand and write visual language.\"   Initiatives have included baby and toddler tours, specialized training for all staff, docents, volunteers and the launch of a website, www.vislit.org. In November 2014, the museum hosted the International Visual Literacy Association (IVLA) conference, the first Museum to do so. Kennedy has been a frequent speaker on the topic, including 2010 and 2013 TEDx talks on visual and sensory literacy.\nKennedy has expressed an interest in expanding the museum's collection of contemporary art and art by indigenous peoples. Works by Frank Stella, Sean Scully, Jaume Plensa, Ravinder Reddy and Mary Sibande have been acquired.  In addition, the museum has made major acquisitions of Old Master paintings by Frans Hals and Luca Giordano.During his tenure the Toledo Museum of Art has announced the return of several objects from its collection due to claims the objects were stolen and/or illegally exported prior being sold to the museum.  In 2011 a Meissen sweetmeat stand was returned to Germany followed by an Etruscan Kalpis or water jug to Italy (2013), an Indian sculpture of Ganesha (2014) and an astrological compendium to Germany in 2015.\n\nHood Museum of Art\nKennedy became Director of the Hood Museum of Art in July 2005. During his tenure, he implemented a series of large and small-scale exhibitions and oversaw the production of more than 20 publications to bring greater public attention to the museum's remarkable collections of the arts of America, Europe, Africa, Papua New Guinea and the Polar regions. At 70,000 objects, the Hood has one of the largest collections on any American college of university campus. The exhibition, Black Womanhood: Images, Icons, and Ideologies of the African Body, toured several US venues. Kennedy increased campus curricular use of works of art, with thousands of objects pulled from storage for classes annually. Numerous acquisitions were made with the museum's generous endowments, and he curated several exhibitions: including Wenda Gu: Forest of Stone Steles: Retranslation and Rewriting Tang Dynasty Poetry, Sean Scully: The Art of the Stripe, and Frank Stella: Irregular Polygons.\n\nPublications\nKennedy has written or edited a number of books on art, including:\n\nAlfred Chester Beatty and Ireland 1950-1968: A study in cultural politics, Glendale Press (1988), ISBN 978-0-907606-49-9\nDreams and responsibilities: The state and arts in independent Ireland, Arts Council of Ireland (1990), ISBN 978-0-906627-32-7\nJack B Yeats: Jack Butler Yeats, 1871-1957 (Lives of Irish Artists), Unipub (October 1991), ISBN 978-0-948524-24-0\nThe Anatomy Lesson: Art and Medicine (with Davis Coakley), National Gallery of Ireland (January 1992), ISBN 978-0-903162-65-4\nIreland: Art into History (with Raymond Gillespie), Roberts Rinehart Publishers (1994), ISBN 978-1-57098-005-3\nIrish Painting, Roberts Rinehart Publishers (November 1997),  ISBN 978-1-86059-059-7\nSean Scully: The Art of the Stripe, Hood Museum of Art (October 2008), ISBN 978-0-944722-34-3\nFrank Stella: Irregular Polygons, 1965-1966, Hood Museum of Art (October 2010), ISBN 978-0-944722-39-8\n\nHonors and achievements\nKennedy was awarded the Australian Centenary Medal in 2001 for service to Australian Society and its art. He is a trustee and treasurer of the Association of Art Museum Directors, a peer reviewer for the American Association of Museums and a member of the International Association of Art Critics. In 2013 he was appointed inaugural eminent professor at the University of Toledo and received an honorary doctorate from Lourdes University.

She and her sister were slaves. She spent the rest of her life in Medina and had a son, Ibrahim with Muhammad. The son died as an infant and she died almost five years later.Al-Maqrizi says that she was a native of Hebenu (Coptic: \u2ca1\u2c99\u2c81\u2c9b\u03e9\u2c81\u2c83\u2c93\u2c9b, Koin\u0113 Greek: \u1f08\u03bb\u03ac\u03b2\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03c9\u03bd \u03c0\u03cc\u03bb\u03b9\u03c2 Al\u00e1bastr\u014dn p\u00f3lis, Arabic: \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0641\u0646, romanized: al-Khafn), a village located near Antino\u00f6polis.\n\nBiography\nIn the Islamic year 6 AH (627 \u2013 628 CE), Muhammad is said to have had letters written to the great rulers of the Middle East, proclaiming the continuation of the monotheistic faith with its final messages and inviting the rulers to join. The purported texts of some of the letters are found in Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari's History of the Prophets and Kings. Tabari writes that a deputation was sent to an Egyptian governor named as al-Muqawqis. Maria was a slave who was offered as a gift of goodwill to Muhammad in reply to his envoys inviting the governor of Alexandria to Islam. Muhammad emancipated her after the birth of her son.\nTabari recounts the story of Maria's arrival from Egypt:\n\nIn this year H\u0101tib b. Abi Balta'ah came back from al-Muqawqis bringing M\u0101riyah and her sister S\u012br\u012bn, his female mule Duldul, his donkey Ya'f\u016br, and sets of garments. With the two women al-Muqawqis had sent a eunuch, and the latter stayed with them. H\u0101tib had invited them to become Muslims before he arrived with them, and M\u0101riyah and her sister did so. The Messenger of God, peace and blessings of Allah be upon Him, lodged them with Umm Sulaym bt. Milh\u0101n. M\u0101riyah was beautiful. The prophet sent her sister S\u012br\u012bn to Hass\u0101n b. Th\u0101bit and she bore him 'Abd al-Rahm\u0101n b. Hass\u0101n.\nThe death of Ibrahim caused Muhammad to weep.\n\nStatus as a wife or concubine\nMuhammad's earliest biographers, like Ibn Ishaq, Ibn Sa\u2019d, and al-Tabari, mentioned Mariyah as the Prophet\u2019s slavegirl or concubine in their sirah.Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya is another scholar and biographer of prophet Muhammad who writes a sirah called Zad al-Ma'ad where he mentioned Mariyah as a slave girl.Like Rayhana bint Zayd, there is some debate between historians and scholars as to whether Mariyah ever became Muhammad's wife or remained a concubine. An indication that she was a concubine is that when she bore her son to Muhammad, she was set free.\nIbn \u2018Abbas said: When Maria gave birth to Ibrahim the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) said, \u2018Her son has set her free.\u2019  There is also strong evidence that there was no living quarter for her in the proximity of the Prophet's Mosque. Only the wives of Muhammad had their quarters adjacent to one another in the proximity of his mosque at Medina. Maria was made to reside permanently in an orchard, some three kilometers from the mosque. Evidence that suggests she was a concubine is in the narration:\nAnas said:  The Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) had a female-slave (amat) with whom he had intercourse, but \u2018Aishah and Hafsah would not leave him alone until he said that she was forbidden for him. Then Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, revealed: \u201cO Prophet! Why do you forbid (for yourself) that which Allah has allowed to you.\u2019 until the end of the Verse.\u201d\nThe \u2018female-slave\u2019 referred to in this narration was Maria, the Copt, as specified in a hadith attributed to Umar and classified as sahih by Ibn Kathir, which names her Umm Ibrahim (the mother of Ibrahim).In a report from Ibn \u2018Abbas and \u2018Urwah b. al-Zubair concerning the same incident, Muhammad said to Hafsa:\n\nI make you witness that I my concubine (surriyyati) is now forbidden unto me.\nSome Islamic scholars point to a different Asb\u0101b al-nuz\u016bl (circumstance of revelation) for the above incident, saying it was only caused by Muhammad drinking honey, as narrated in Sahih al-Bukhari by Muhammed's wife Aisha:\nThe Prophet (\ufdfa) used to stay (for a period) in the house of Zaynab bint Jahsh (one of the wives of the Prophet ) and he used to drink honey in her house. Hafsa bint Umar and I decided that when the Prophet (\ufdfa) entered upon either of us, she would say, \"I smell in you the bad smell of Maghafir (a bad smelling raisin). Have you eaten Maghafir?\" When he entered upon one of us, she said that to him. He replied (to her), \"No, but I have drunk honey in the house of Zaynab bint Jahsh, and I will never drink it again.\"\nHowever, another narration in Sunan Abu Dawud indicates that drinking honey is a euphemism for sexual intercourse:\n\nThe Apostle of Allah (peace be upon him) was asked about a man who divorced his wife three times, and she married another who entered upon her, but divorced her before having intercourse with her, whether she was lawful for the former husband. She said: The Prophet (peace be upon him) replied: She is not lawful for the first (husband) until she tastes the honey of the other husband and he tastes her honey.\nAl-Tabari lists Maria as both one of Muhammad's wives and his slave, perhaps using \"wife\" in the sense of one whom Muhammad slept with and who mothered his child.\nMariyah the Copt was presented to the Messenger of God, given to him by al-Muqawqis, the ruler of Alexandria, and she gave birth to the Messenger of God\u2019s son Ibrahim. These were the Messenger of God's wifes.\nThe Prophet admired Umm Ibrahim [\"Mother of Ibrahim,\" Mariyah\u2019s title], who was fair-skinned and beautiful. He lodged her in al-\u2018Aliyah, at the property nowadays called of Umm Ibrahim. He used to visit her there and ordered her to veil herself, [but] he had intercourse with her by virtue of her being his property...\nOne hadith attributed to Mus\u2018ab b. \u2018Abdullah al-Zubairi states that the two were married, though another rendering of the hadith by Mus\u2018ab's nephew Zubair b. al-Bakkar makes no mention of marriage.\n\nSee also\nAisha bint Abu Bakr\nList of non-Arab Sahaba\n\nNotes\nPassage 4:\nIbrahim ibn Muhammad Al ash-Sheikh\nIbrahim ibn Muhammad Al ash-Sheikh  was a leading Salafi scholar in Saudi Arabia and minister of justice between 1975 and 1990.\n\nBackground\nIbrahim ibn Muhammad Al ash-Sheikh was born into the noted family of Saudi religious scholars, the Al ash-Sheikh, descendants of Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab, the influential Muslim scholar. He was the eldest son of Muhammad ibn Ibrahim Al ash-Sheikh, Grand Mufti of Saudi Arabia until 1969.\n\nCareer\nIbrahim ibn Muhammad was one of the most influential religious leaders in the early 1970s. He maintained a close relationship with King Faisal, with whom he met on a weekly basis. He believed that Saudi Arabia should take a leading role in the Arab world and pushed for Saudi involvement in war with Israel.Between 1975 and 1990, he served as minister of justice.\n\nFamily\nHis brother Abdullah ibn Muhammad Al ash-Sheikh, a younger son of the late Grand Mufti, also served as minister of justice, from 1993 to 2009. His grandson Turki is a lawyer practicing in London and Riyadh.\nPassage 5:\nAbdullah ibn Muhammad\n\u02bfAbd All\u0101h ibn Mu\u1e25ammad (Arabic: \u0639\u064e\u0628\u0652\u062f \u0671\u0644\u0644\u064e\u0651\u0670\u0647 \u0671\u0628\u0652\u0646 \u0645\u064f\u062d\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0651\u062f) also known as al-\u1e6c\u0101hir (lit.\u2009'the pure') and al-\u1e6cayyib (lit.\u2009'the good') was one of the sons of Muhammad and Khadija. He died in childhood.\nHis full name was Abd Allah ibn Muhammad ibn Abd Allah ibn Shaiba. His father became a successful merchant and was involved in trade. Due to his upright character Muhammad acquired the nickname \"al-Amin\" (Arabic: \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0645\u064a\u0646), meaning \"faithful, trustworthy\" and \"al-Sadiq\" meaning \"truthful\" and was sought out as an impartial arbitrator. His reputation attracted a proposal in 595 from Khadija, a successful businesswoman. Muhammad consented to the marriage, which by all accounts was a happy one. After the marriage was consummated, his elder brother al-Qasim was born. Qasim was the eldest son of Muhammad and Khadija. After Qasim, his four sisters were born. Abd Allah was born around 611. He was the youngest child of Muhammad and Khadija.\nMuhammad gave him the name of his father. Abd Allah died at 4 in 615 CE.\n\nSiblings\n\nQasim ibn Muhammad\nZainab bint Muhammad\nRuqayya bint Muhammad\nUmm Kulthum bint Muhammad\nFatima bint Muhammad\nIbrahim ibn Muhammad\nPassage 6:\nIbrahim ibn Muhammad\nIbr\u0101h\u012bm ibn Mu\u1e25ammad (Arabic: \u0625\u0650\u0628\u0652\u0631\u064e\u0627\u0647\u0650\u064a\u0645 \u0671\u0628\u0652\u0646 \u0645\u064f\u062d\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0651\u062f), was the son of the Islamic prophet Muhammad and Maria al-Qibtiyya. He died at the age of 2.\n\nEclipse occurrence\nIn his book \"Al-Bid\u0101ya wa-n-Nih\u0101ya\" Ibn Kathir mentions that Ibrahim died on Thursday 10 Rabi' al-Awwal 10 AH, and on the same day right after his death, an eclipse of the sun occurred, so people at the moment started talking that Allah is showing his condolences to his prophet by eclipsing the Sun. Muhammad, not wanting his companions to fall into Fitna by ascribing divinities to him or his son, stood at the mosque and said:  \"The sun and the moon do not eclipse because of the death or life (i.e. birth) of someone. When you see the eclipse pray and invoke Allah.\"\n\nIllness and death\nMuhammad's wife, and the mother of believers, Ibrahim's mother was an Egyptian woman who came from Byzantine official to Muhammad in 628. According to Ibn Kathir, quoting Ibn Sa'd, he was born in the last month of the year 8 AH, equivalent of 630 CE. Muslim scholars such as Muslim ibn al-Hajjaj and Al-Nasa'i mention that Al-Waqidi is not reliable and is not trustworthy to be quoted. The child was named after Abraham (or Ibrahim in Arabic) the Biblical prophet revered in Jewish, Christian and Muslim traditions. Ibrahim was placed in the care of a nurse called Umm Sayf, wife of Abu Sayf, the blacksmith, in the tradition of the Arabs of the time, to whom Muhammad gave some goats to complement her milk supply. When he fell ill he was moved to a date orchard near the residence of his mother, under the care of her and her sister Sirin. When it was clear that he would not likely survive, Muhammad was informed. His reaction to the news is reported as:\n\nHe was so shocked at the news that he felt his knees could no longer carry him, and asked `Abd al Rahman ibn `Awf to give him his hand to lean upon. He proceeded immediately to the orchard and arrived in time to bid farewell to an infant dying in his mother's lap. Prophet Muhammad took the child and laid him in his own lap while shaking his hand. His heart was torn apart by the new tragedy, and his face mirrored his inner pain. Choking with sorrow, he said to his son, \"O Ibrahim, against the judgement of God, we cannot avail you a thing,\" and then fell silent. Tears flowed from his eyes. The child lapsed gradually, and his mother and aunt watched and cried incessantly, and the Prophet never ordered them to stop. As Ibrahim surrendered to death, Prophet Muhammad's hope which had consoled him for a brief while completely crumbled. With tears in his eyes he talked once more to the dead child: \"O Ibrahim, were the truth not certain that the last of us will join the first, we would have mourned you even more than we do now.\" A moment later he said: \"The eyes send their tears and the heart is saddened, but we do not say anything except that which pleases our Lord. Indeed, O Ibrahim, we are bereaved by your departure from us.\"\n\nBurial\nMuhammad is also reported as having informed Maria and Sirin that Ibrahim would have his own nurse in Paradise. Different accounts relate that the ghusl for Ibrahim was performed by either Umm Burdah, or al-Fadl ibn \u02bfAbbas, in preparation for burial. Thereafter, he was carried to the cemetery upon a little bier by Muhammad, his uncle al-\u02bfAbbas, and others. Here, after a funeral prayer led by Muhammad, he was interred. Muhammad then filled the grave with sand, sprinkled some water upon it, and placed a landmark on it, saying that \"Tombstones do neither good nor ill, but they help appease the living.

She and her sister were slaves. She spent the rest of her life in Medina and had a son, Ibrahim with Muhammad. The son died as an infant and she died almost five years later.Al-Maqrizi says that she was a native of Hebenu (Coptic: \u2ca1\u2c99\u2c81\u2c9b\u03e9\u2c81\u2c83\u2c93\u2c9b, Koin\u0113 Greek: \u1f08\u03bb\u03ac\u03b2\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03c9\u03bd \u03c0\u03cc\u03bb\u03b9\u03c2 Al\u00e1bastr\u014dn p\u00f3lis, Arabic: \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0641\u0646, romanized: al-Khafn), a village located near Antino\u00f6polis.\n\nBiography\nIn the Islamic year 6 AH (627 \u2013 628 CE), Muhammad is said to have had letters written to the great rulers of the Middle East, proclaiming the continuation of the monotheistic faith with its final messages and inviting the rulers to join. The purported texts of some of the letters are found in Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari's History of the Prophets and Kings. Tabari writes that a deputation was sent to an Egyptian governor named as al-Muqawqis. Maria was a slave who was offered as a gift of goodwill to Muhammad in reply to his envoys inviting the governor of Alexandria to Islam. Muhammad emancipated her after the birth of her son.\nTabari recounts the story of Maria's arrival from Egypt:\n\nIn this year H\u0101tib b. Abi Balta'ah came back from al-Muqawqis bringing M\u0101riyah and her sister S\u012br\u012bn, his female mule Duldul, his donkey Ya'f\u016br, and sets of garments. With the two women al-Muqawqis had sent a eunuch, and the latter stayed with them. H\u0101tib had invited them to become Muslims before he arrived with them, and M\u0101riyah and her sister did so. The Messenger of God, peace and blessings of Allah be upon Him, lodged them with Umm Sulaym bt. Milh\u0101n. M\u0101riyah was beautiful. The prophet sent her sister S\u012br\u012bn to Hass\u0101n b. Th\u0101bit and she bore him 'Abd al-Rahm\u0101n b. Hass\u0101n.\nThe death of Ibrahim caused Muhammad to weep.\n\nStatus as a wife or concubine\nMuhammad's earliest biographers, like Ibn Ishaq, Ibn Sa\u2019d, and al-Tabari, mentioned Mariyah as the Prophet\u2019s slavegirl or concubine in their sirah.Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya is another scholar and biographer of prophet Muhammad who writes a sirah called Zad al-Ma'ad where he mentioned Mariyah as a slave girl.Like Rayhana bint Zayd, there is some debate between historians and scholars as to whether Mariyah ever became Muhammad's wife or remained a concubine. An indication that she was a concubine is that when she bore her son to Muhammad, she was set free.\nIbn \u2018Abbas said: When Maria gave birth to Ibrahim the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) said, \u2018Her son has set her free.\u2019  There is also strong evidence that there was no living quarter for her in the proximity of the Prophet's Mosque. Only the wives of Muhammad had their quarters adjacent to one another in the proximity of his mosque at Medina. Maria was made to reside permanently in an orchard, some three kilometers from the mosque. Evidence that suggests she was a concubine is in the narration:\nAnas said:  The Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) had a female-slave (amat) with whom he had intercourse, but \u2018Aishah and Hafsah would not leave him alone until he said that she was forbidden for him. Then Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, revealed: \u201cO Prophet! Why do you forbid (for yourself) that which Allah has allowed to you.\u2019 until the end of the Verse.\u201d\nThe \u2018female-slave\u2019 referred to in this narration was Maria, the Copt, as specified in a hadith attributed to Umar and classified as sahih by Ibn Kathir, which names her Umm Ibrahim (the mother of Ibrahim).In a report from Ibn \u2018Abbas and \u2018Urwah b. al-Zubair concerning the same incident, Muhammad said to Hafsa:\n\nI make you witness that I my concubine (surriyyati) is now forbidden unto me.\nSome Islamic scholars point to a different Asb\u0101b al-nuz\u016bl (circumstance of revelation) for the above incident, saying it was only caused by Muhammad drinking honey, as narrated in Sahih al-Bukhari by Muhammed's wife Aisha:\nThe Prophet (\ufdfa) used to stay (for a period) in the house of Zaynab bint Jahsh (one of the wives of the Prophet ) and he used to drink honey in her house. Hafsa bint Umar and I decided that when the Prophet (\ufdfa) entered upon either of us, she would say, \"I smell in you the bad smell of Maghafir (a bad smelling raisin). Have you eaten Maghafir?\" When he entered upon one of us, she said that to him. He replied (to her), \"No, but I have drunk honey in the house of Zaynab bint Jahsh, and I will never drink it again.\"\nHowever, another narration in Sunan Abu Dawud indicates that drinking honey is a euphemism for sexual intercourse:\n\nThe Apostle of Allah (peace be upon him) was asked about a man who divorced his wife three times, and she married another who entered upon her, but divorced her before having intercourse with her, whether she was lawful for the former husband. She said: The Prophet (peace be upon him) replied: She is not lawful for the first (husband) until she tastes the honey of the other husband and he tastes her honey.\nAl-Tabari lists Maria as both one of Muhammad's wives and his slave, perhaps using \"wife\" in the sense of one whom Muhammad slept with and who mothered his child.\nMariyah the Copt was presented to the Messenger of God, given to him by al-Muqawqis, the ruler of Alexandria, and she gave birth to the Messenger of God\u2019s son Ibrahim. These were the Messenger of God's wifes.\nThe Prophet admired Umm Ibrahim [\"Mother of Ibrahim,\" Mariyah\u2019s title], who was fair-skinned and beautiful. He lodged her in al-\u2018Aliyah, at the property nowadays called of Umm Ibrahim. He used to visit her there and ordered her to veil herself, [but] he had intercourse with her by virtue of her being his property...\nOne hadith attributed to Mus\u2018ab b. \u2018Abdullah al-Zubairi states that the two were married, though another rendering of the hadith by Mus\u2018ab's nephew Zubair b. al-Bakkar makes no mention of marriage.\n\nSee also\nAisha bint Abu Bakr\nList of non-Arab Sahaba\n\nNotes\nPassage 4:\nIbrahim ibn Muhammad Al ash-Sheikh\nIbrahim ibn Muhammad Al ash-Sheikh  was a leading Salafi scholar in Saudi Arabia and minister of justice between 1975 and 1990.\n\nBackground\nIbrahim ibn Muhammad Al ash-Sheikh was born into the noted family of Saudi religious scholars, the Al ash-Sheikh, descendants of Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab, the influential Muslim scholar. He was the eldest son of Muhammad ibn Ibrahim Al ash-Sheikh, Grand Mufti of Saudi Arabia until 1969.\n\nCareer\nIbrahim ibn Muhammad was one of the most influential religious leaders in the early 1970s. He maintained a close relationship with King Faisal, with whom he met on a weekly basis. He believed that Saudi Arabia should take a leading role in the Arab world and pushed for Saudi involvement in war with Israel.Between 1975 and 1990, he served as minister of justice.\n\nFamily\nHis brother Abdullah ibn Muhammad Al ash-Sheikh, a younger son of the late Grand Mufti, also served as minister of justice, from 1993 to 2009. His grandson Turki is a lawyer practicing in London and Riyadh.\nPassage 5:\nAbdullah ibn Muhammad\n\u02bfAbd All\u0101h ibn Mu\u1e25ammad (Arabic: \u0639\u064e\u0628\u0652\u062f \u0671\u0644\u0644\u064e\u0651\u0670\u0647 \u0671\u0628\u0652\u0646 \u0645\u064f\u062d\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0651\u062f) also known as al-\u1e6c\u0101hir (lit.\u2009'the pure') and al-\u1e6cayyib (lit.\u2009'the good') was one of the sons of Muhammad and Khadija. He died in childhood.\nHis full name was Abd Allah ibn Muhammad ibn Abd Allah ibn Shaiba. His father became a successful merchant and was involved in trade. Due to his upright character Muhammad acquired the nickname \"al-Amin\" (Arabic: \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0645\u064a\u0646), meaning \"faithful, trustworthy\" and \"al-Sadiq\" meaning \"truthful\" and was sought out as an impartial arbitrator. His reputation attracted a proposal in 595 from Khadija, a successful businesswoman. Muhammad consented to the marriage, which by all accounts was a happy one. After the marriage was consummated, his elder brother al-Qasim was born. Qasim was the eldest son of Muhammad and Khadija. After Qasim, his four sisters were born. Abd Allah was born around 611. He was the youngest child of Muhammad and Khadija.\nMuhammad gave him the name of his father. Abd Allah died at 4 in 615 CE.\n\nSiblings\n\nQasim ibn Muhammad\nZainab bint Muhammad\nRuqayya bint Muhammad\nUmm Kulthum bint Muhammad\nFatima bint Muhammad\nIbrahim ibn Muhammad\nPassage 6:\nIbrahim ibn Muhammad\nIbr\u0101h\u012bm ibn Mu\u1e25ammad (Arabic: \u0625\u0650\u0628\u0652\u0631\u064e\u0627\u0647\u0650\u064a\u0645 \u0671\u0628\u0652\u0646 \u0645\u064f\u062d\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0651\u062f), was the son of the Islamic prophet Muhammad and Maria al-Qibtiyya. He died at the age of 2.\n\nEclipse occurrence\nIn his book \"Al-Bid\u0101ya wa-n-Nih\u0101ya\" Ibn Kathir mentions that Ibrahim died on Thursday 10 Rabi' al-Awwal 10 AH, and on the same day right after his death, an eclipse of the sun occurred, so people at the moment started talking that Allah is showing his condolences to his prophet by eclipsing the Sun. Muhammad, not wanting his companions to fall into Fitna by ascribing divinities to him or his son, stood at the mosque and said:  \"The sun and the moon do not eclipse because of the death or life (i.e. birth) of someone. When you see the eclipse pray and invoke Allah.\"\n\nIllness and death\nMuhammad's wife, and the mother of believers, Ibrahim's mother was an Egyptian woman who came from Byzantine official to Muhammad in 628. According to Ibn Kathir, quoting Ibn Sa'd, he was born in the last month of the year 8 AH, equivalent of 630 CE. Muslim scholars such as Muslim ibn al-Hajjaj and Al-Nasa'i mention that Al-Waqidi is not reliable and is not trustworthy to be quoted. The child was named after Abraham (or Ibrahim in Arabic) the Biblical prophet revered in Jewish, Christian and Muslim traditions. Ibrahim was placed in the care of a nurse called Umm Sayf, wife of Abu Sayf, the blacksmith, in the tradition of the Arabs of the time, to whom Muhammad gave some goats to complement her milk supply. When he fell ill he was moved to a date orchard near the residence of his mother, under the care of her and her sister Sirin. When it was clear that he would not likely survive, Muhammad was informed. His reaction to the news is reported as:\n\nHe was so shocked at the news that he felt his knees could no longer carry him, and asked `Abd al Rahman ibn `Awf to give him his hand to lean upon. He proceeded immediately to the orchard and arrived in time to bid farewell to an infant dying in his mother's lap. Prophet Muhammad took the child and laid him in his own lap while shaking his hand. His heart was torn apart by the new tragedy, and his face mirrored his inner pain. Choking with sorrow, he said to his son, \"O Ibrahim, against the judgement of God, we cannot avail you a thing,\" and then fell silent. Tears flowed from his eyes. The child lapsed gradually, and his mother and aunt watched and cried incessantly, and the Prophet never ordered them to stop. As Ibrahim surrendered to death, Prophet Muhammad's hope which had consoled him for a brief while completely crumbled. With tears in his eyes he talked once more to the dead child: \"O Ibrahim, were the truth not certain that the last of us will join the first, we would have mourned you even more than we do now.\" A moment later he said: \"The eyes send their tears and the heart is saddened, but we do not say anything except that which pleases our Lord. Indeed, O Ibrahim, we are bereaved by your departure from us.\"\n\nBurial\nMuhammad is also reported as having informed Maria and Sirin that Ibrahim would have his own nurse in Paradise. Different accounts relate that the ghusl for Ibrahim was performed by either Umm Burdah, or al-Fadl ibn \u02bfAbbas, in preparation for burial. Thereafter, he was carried to the cemetery upon a little bier by Muhammad, his uncle al-\u02bfAbbas, and others. Here, after a funeral prayer led by Muhammad, he was interred. Muhammad then filled the grave with sand, sprinkled some water upon it, and placed a landmark on it, saying that \"Tombstones do neither good nor ill, but they help appease the living. Anything that man does, God wishes him to do well.\"\n\nSiblings\nQasim ibn Muhammad\nAbd Allah ibn Muhammad\nZainab bint Muhammad\nRuqayya bint Muhammad\nUmm Kulthum bint Muhammad\nFatimah al-Zahra bint Muhammad\n\nSee also\nIslam and children\nPassage 7:\nIbrahim ibn al-Husayn (Ibn al-Walid)\nIbrahim ibn al-Husayn ibn Ali ibn Muhammad ibn al-Walid (Arabic: \u0625\u0628\u0631\u0627\u0647\u064a\u0645 \u0628\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0633\u064a\u0646 \u0628\u0646 \u0639\u0644\u064a \u0628\u0646 \u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0628\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0648\u0644\u064a\u062f, romanized: Ibr\u0101h\u012bm ibn al-\u1e24usayn ibn \u02bfAl\u012b ibn Mu\u1e25ammad ibn al-Wal\u012bd) was the eleventh Tayyibi Isma'ili D\u0101\u02bf\u012b al-Mu\u1e6dlaq in Yemen, from 1287 to his death in 1328.\n\nLife\nIbrahim was a member of the Banu al-Walid al-Anf family, that dominated the office of D\u0101\u02bf\u012b al-Mu\u1e6dlaq almost continuously in the 13th to early 16th centuries.

It was Fassbinder's last film, released shortly after his death at the age of 37.\n\nPlot\nThe plot centers on the handsome Belgian sailor Georges Querelle, who is also a thief and murderer. When his ship, Le Vengeur, arrives in Brest, he visits the Feria, a bar and brothel for sailors run by the Madame Lysiane, whose lover, Robert, is Querelle's brother. Querelle has a love/hate relationship with his brother: when they meet at La Feria, they embrace, but also punch one another slowly and repeatedly in the belly. Lysiane's husband Nono works behind the bar and also manages La Feria's underhanded affairs with the assistance of his friend, the corrupt police captain Mario.\nQuerelle makes a deal to sell opium to Nono. During the execution of the deal, he murders his accomplice Vic by slitting his throat.  After delivering the drugs, Querelle announces that he wants to sleep with Lysiane.  He knows that this means he will have to throw dice with Nono, who has the privilege of playing a game of chance with all of her prospective lovers. If Nono loses, the suitor is allowed to proceed with his affair. If the suitor loses, however, he must submit to anal sex with Nono first, according to Nono's maxim that \"That way, I can say my wife only sleeps with arseholes.\" Querelle deliberately loses the game, allowing himself to be sodomized by Nono. When Nono gloats about Querelle's \"loss\" to Robert, who won his dice game, the brothers end up in a violent fight.  Later, Querelle becomes Lysiane's lover, and also has sex with Mario.\nLuckily for Querelle, a builder, Gil, murders his work mate Theo, who had been harassing and sexually assaulting him.  Gil hides from the police in an abandoned prison, and Roger, who is in love with Gil, establishes contact between Querelle and Gil in the hopes that Querelle can help Gil flee. Querelle falls in love with Gil, who closely resembles his brother.  Gil returns his affections, but Querelle betrays Gil by tipping off the police. Querelle cleverly arranged it so that the murder of Vic is also blamed on Gil.\nQuerelle's superior, Lieutenant Seblon, is in love with Querelle, and constantly tries to prove his manliness to him. Seblon is aware that Querelle murdered Vic, but chooses to protect him.  Later, Seblon reveals his love and concern to a drunken Querelle, and they kiss and embrace before returning to Le Vengeur.\n\nCast\nBrad Davis as Querelle\nFranco Nero as Lieutenant Seblon\nJeanne Moreau as Lysiane\nLaurent Malet as Roger Bataille\nHanno P\u00f6schl as Robert / Gil\nG\u00fcnther Kaufmann as Nono\nBurkhard Driest as Mario\nRoger Fritz as Marcellin\nDieter Schidor as Vic Rivette\nNatja Brunckhorst as Paulette\nWerner Asam as Worker\nAxel Bauer as Worker\nNeil Bell as Theo\nRobert van Ackeren as Drunken legionnaire\nWolf Gremm as Drunken legionnaire\nFrank Ripploh as Drunken legionnaire\n\nProduction\nAccording to Genet's biographer Edmund White, Querelle was originally going to be made by Werner Schroeter, with a scenario by Burkhard Driest, and produced by Dieter Schidor. However, Schidor could not find the money to finance a film by Schroeter, and therefore turned to other directors, including John Schlesinger and Sam Peckinpah, before finally settling on Fassbinder. Driest wrote a radically different script for Fassbinder, who then \"took the linear narrative and jumbled it up\". White quotes Schidor as saying \"Fassbinder did something totally different, he took the words of Genet and tried to meditate on something other than the story. The story became totally unimportant for him. He also said publicly that the story was a sort of third-rate police story that wouldn't be worth making a movie about without putting a particular moral impact into it\".Schroeter had wanted to make a black and white film with amateur actors and location shots, but Fassbinder instead shot it with professional actors in a lurid, expressionist color, and on sets in the studio. Edmund White comments that the result is a film in which, \"Everything is bathed in an artificial light and the architectural elements are all symbolic.\"\n\nSoundtrack\nJeanne Moreau \u2013 \"Each Man Kills the Things He Loves\" (music by Peer Raben, lyrics from Oscar Wilde's poem \"The Ballad of Reading Gaol\")\n\"Young and Joyful Bandit\" (Music by Peer Raben, lyrics by Jeanne Moreau)Both songs were nominated to the 1984 Razzie Awards for \"Worst Original Song\".\n\nRelease\nQuerelle sold more than 100,000 tickets in the first three weeks after its release in Paris, the first time that a film with a gay theme had achieved such success. On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, which categorizes reviews as positive or negative only, the film has an approval rating of 57% calculated based on 14 critics comments. By comparison, with the same opinions being calculated using a weighted arithmetic mean, the rating is 6.10/10. Writing for The New York Times critic Vincent Canby noted that Querelle was \"a mess...a detour that leads to a dead end.\"\nPenny Ashbrook calls Querelle Fassbinder's \"perfect epitaph: an intensely personal statement that is the most uncompromising portrayal of gay male sensibility to come from a major filmmaker.\" Edmund White considers Querelle the only film based on Genet's book that works, calling it \"visually as artificial and menacing as Genet's prose.\" Genet, in discussion with Schidor, said that he had not seen the film, commenting \"You can't smoke at the movies.\"\nPassage 10:\nIronmaster (film)\nIronmaster (Italian: La guerra del ferro: Ironmaster) is a 1983 film directed by Umberto Lenzi.\n\nProduction\nIronmaster was filmed on location at Custer State Park in South Dakota with interiors shot at RPA-Elios Studios in Rome.\n\nRelease\nIronmaster was released in Italy on 10 March 1983. The film was released on Blu-ray on 23 January 2017 in North America by Code Red and on 10 April 2017 in the United Kingdom by 88 Films.\n\nReception\nAccording to Michael Klossner, author of Prehistoric Humans in Film and Television, while Ironmaster received \"few and very bad notices [and is] simple, only modestly ambitious and has its share of flaws \u2026 it's hard not to like a film which shows intelligent, articulate prehistoric people making discoveries, facing moral issues and showing capacity for great evil and finally for good.\" Hal Erickson wrote in AllMovie that \"Seldom has there been a more predictable 98 minutes' worth of Sword and Sorcery, but that doesn't mean it isn't enjoyable.\"\n\nAnswer the question based on the given passages.

It was Fassbinder's last film, released shortly after his death at the age of 37.\n\nPlot\nThe plot centers on the handsome Belgian sailor Georges Querelle, who is also a thief and murderer. When his ship, Le Vengeur, arrives in Brest, he visits the Feria, a bar and brothel for sailors run by the Madame Lysiane, whose lover, Robert, is Querelle's brother. Querelle has a love/hate relationship with his brother: when they meet at La Feria, they embrace, but also punch one another slowly and repeatedly in the belly. Lysiane's husband Nono works behind the bar and also manages La Feria's underhanded affairs with the assistance of his friend, the corrupt police captain Mario.\nQuerelle makes a deal to sell opium to Nono. During the execution of the deal, he murders his accomplice Vic by slitting his throat.  After delivering the drugs, Querelle announces that he wants to sleep with Lysiane.  He knows that this means he will have to throw dice with Nono, who has the privilege of playing a game of chance with all of her prospective lovers. If Nono loses, the suitor is allowed to proceed with his affair. If the suitor loses, however, he must submit to anal sex with Nono first, according to Nono's maxim that \"That way, I can say my wife only sleeps with arseholes.\" Querelle deliberately loses the game, allowing himself to be sodomized by Nono. When Nono gloats about Querelle's \"loss\" to Robert, who won his dice game, the brothers end up in a violent fight.  Later, Querelle becomes Lysiane's lover, and also has sex with Mario.\nLuckily for Querelle, a builder, Gil, murders his work mate Theo, who had been harassing and sexually assaulting him.  Gil hides from the police in an abandoned prison, and Roger, who is in love with Gil, establishes contact between Querelle and Gil in the hopes that Querelle can help Gil flee. Querelle falls in love with Gil, who closely resembles his brother.  Gil returns his affections, but Querelle betrays Gil by tipping off the police. Querelle cleverly arranged it so that the murder of Vic is also blamed on Gil.\nQuerelle's superior, Lieutenant Seblon, is in love with Querelle, and constantly tries to prove his manliness to him. Seblon is aware that Querelle murdered Vic, but chooses to protect him.  Later, Seblon reveals his love and concern to a drunken Querelle, and they kiss and embrace before returning to Le Vengeur.\n\nCast\nBrad Davis as Querelle\nFranco Nero as Lieutenant Seblon\nJeanne Moreau as Lysiane\nLaurent Malet as Roger Bataille\nHanno P\u00f6schl as Robert / Gil\nG\u00fcnther Kaufmann as Nono\nBurkhard Driest as Mario\nRoger Fritz as Marcellin\nDieter Schidor as Vic Rivette\nNatja Brunckhorst as Paulette\nWerner Asam as Worker\nAxel Bauer as Worker\nNeil Bell as Theo\nRobert van Ackeren as Drunken legionnaire\nWolf Gremm as Drunken legionnaire\nFrank Ripploh as Drunken legionnaire\n\nProduction\nAccording to Genet's biographer Edmund White, Querelle was originally going to be made by Werner Schroeter, with a scenario by Burkhard Driest, and produced by Dieter Schidor. However, Schidor could not find the money to finance a film by Schroeter, and therefore turned to other directors, including John Schlesinger and Sam Peckinpah, before finally settling on Fassbinder. Driest wrote a radically different script for Fassbinder, who then \"took the linear narrative and jumbled it up\". White quotes Schidor as saying \"Fassbinder did something totally different, he took the words of Genet and tried to meditate on something other than the story. The story became totally unimportant for him. He also said publicly that the story was a sort of third-rate police story that wouldn't be worth making a movie about without putting a particular moral impact into it\".Schroeter had wanted to make a black and white film with amateur actors and location shots, but Fassbinder instead shot it with professional actors in a lurid, expressionist color, and on sets in the studio. Edmund White comments that the result is a film in which, \"Everything is bathed in an artificial light and the architectural elements are all symbolic.\"\n\nSoundtrack\nJeanne Moreau \u2013 \"Each Man Kills the Things He Loves\" (music by Peer Raben, lyrics from Oscar Wilde's poem \"The Ballad of Reading Gaol\")\n\"Young and Joyful Bandit\" (Music by Peer Raben, lyrics by Jeanne Moreau)Both songs were nominated to the 1984 Razzie Awards for \"Worst Original Song\".\n\nRelease\nQuerelle sold more than 100,000 tickets in the first three weeks after its release in Paris, the first time that a film with a gay theme had achieved such success. On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, which categorizes reviews as positive or negative only, the film has an approval rating of 57% calculated based on 14 critics comments. By comparison, with the same opinions being calculated using a weighted arithmetic mean, the rating is 6.10/10. Writing for The New York Times critic Vincent Canby noted that Querelle was \"a mess...a detour that leads to a dead end.\"\nPenny Ashbrook calls Querelle Fassbinder's \"perfect epitaph: an intensely personal statement that is the most uncompromising portrayal of gay male sensibility to come from a major filmmaker.\" Edmund White considers Querelle the only film based on Genet's book that works, calling it \"visually as artificial and menacing as Genet's prose.\" Genet, in discussion with Schidor, said that he had not seen the film, commenting \"You can't smoke at the movies.\"\nPassage 10:\nIronmaster (film)\nIronmaster (Italian: La guerra del ferro: Ironmaster) is a 1983 film directed by Umberto Lenzi.\n\nProduction\nIronmaster was filmed on location at Custer State Park in South Dakota with interiors shot at RPA-Elios Studios in Rome.\n\nRelease\nIronmaster was released in Italy on 10 March 1983. The film was released on Blu-ray on 23 January 2017 in North America by Code Red and on 10 April 2017 in the United Kingdom by 88 Films.\n\nReception\nAccording to Michael Klossner, author of Prehistoric Humans in Film and Television, while Ironmaster received \"few and very bad notices [and is] simple, only modestly ambitious and has its share of flaws \u2026 it's hard not to like a film which shows intelligent, articulate prehistoric people making discoveries, facing moral issues and showing capacity for great evil and finally for good.\" Hal Erickson wrote in AllMovie that \"Seldom has there been a more predictable 98 minutes' worth of Sword and Sorcery, but that doesn't mean it isn't enjoyable.\"", "answers": ["Mickey'S Tent Show"], "length": 2858, "dataset": "2wikimqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "4adca5ba1654b740d1e25c6e73d45aa2f3621537bed9086b", "pred": " Mickey'S Tent Show.

In the following game, the last away match of the season, he took 10 Hampshire wickets for 150 runs in the match at Bournemouth. In the 1948 season as a whole, he took 91 wickets at an average of 28.07. As a tail-end left-handed batsman, he managed just 93 runs in the season at an average of 4.22.The emergence of Tony Lock as a slow left-arm bowler in 1949 brought a stuttering end of McMahon's Surrey career. Though he played in 12 first-class matches in the 1949 season, McMahon took only 19 wickets; a similar number of matches in 1950 brought 34 wickets. In 1951, he played just seven times and in 1952 only three times. In 1953, Lock split the first finger of his left hand, and played in only 11 of Surrey's County Championship matches; McMahon played as his deputy in 14 Championship matches, though a measure of their comparative merits was that Lock's 11 games produced 67 wickets at 12.38 runs apiece, while McMahon's 14 games brought him 45 wickets at the, for him, low average of 21.53. At the end of the 1953 season, McMahon was allowed to leave Surrey to join Somerset, then languishing at the foot of the County Championship and recruiting widely from other counties and other countries.\n\nSomerset cricketer\nSomerset's slow bowling in 1954 was in the hands of leg-spinner Johnny Lawrence, with support from the off-spin of Jim Hilton while promising off-spinner Brian Langford was on national service. McMahon filled a vacancy for a left-arm orthodox spinner that had been there since the retirement of Horace Hazell at the end of the 1952 season; Hazell's apparent successor, Roy Smith, had failed to realise his promise as a bowler in 1953, though his batting had advanced significantly.\nMcMahon instantly became a first-team regular and played in almost every match during his four years with the county, not missing a single Championship game until he was controversially dropped from the side in August 1957, after which he did not play in the Championship again.In the 1954 season, McMahon, alongside fellow newcomer Hilton, was something of a disappointment, according to Wisden: \"The new spin bowlers, McMahon and Hilton, did not attain to the best standards of their craft in a wet summer, yet, like the rest of the attack, they would have fared better with reasonable support in the field and from their own batsmen,\" it said. McMahon took 85 wickets at an average of 27.47 (Hilton took only 42 at a higher average). His best match was against Essex at Weston-super-Mare where he took six for 96 in the first innings and five for 45 in the second to finish with match figures of 11 for 141, which were the best of his career. He was awarded his county cap in the 1954 season, but Somerset remained at the bottom of the table.\nThe figures for the 1955 were similar: McMahon this time took 75 wickets at 28.77 apiece. There was a small improvement in his batting and the arrival of Bryan Lobb elevated McMahon to No 10 in the batting order for most of the season, and he responded with 262 runs and an average of 9.03. This included his highest-ever score, 24, made in the match against Sussex at Frome. A week later in Somerset's next match, he equalled his best-ever bowling performance, taking eight Kent wickets for 46 runs in the first innings of a match at Yeovil through what Wisden called \"clever variation of flight and spin\". These matches brought two victories for Somerset, but there were only two others in the 1955 season and the side finished at the bottom of the Championship for the fourth season running.At the end of the 1955 season, Lawrence retired and McMahon became Somerset's senior spin bowler for the 1956 season, with Langford returning from National Service as the main support. McMahon responded with his most successful season so far, taking 103 wickets at an average of 25.57, the only season in his career in which he exceeded 100 wickets. The bowling average improved still further in 1957 to 23.10 when McMahon took 86 wickets. But his season came to an abrupt end in mid-August 1957 when, after 108 consecutive Championship matches, he was dropped from the first team during the Weston-super-Mare festival. Though he played some games for the second eleven later in August, he regained his place in the first team for only a single end-of-season friendly match, and he was told that his services were not required for the future, a decision, said Wisden, that \"proved highly controversial\".\n\nSacked by Somerset\nThe reason behind McMahon's sacking did not become public knowledge for many years. In its obituary of him in 2002, McMahon was described by Wisden as \"a man who embraced the antipodean virtues of candour and conviviality\". It went on: \"Legend tells of a night at the Flying Horse Inn in Nottingham when he beheaded the gladioli with an ornamental sword, crying: 'When Mac drinks, everybody drinks!'\" The obituary recounts a further escapade in second eleven match at Midsomer Norton where a curfew imposed on the team was circumvented by \"a POW-type loop\" organised by McMahon, \"with his team-mates escaping through a ground-storey window and then presenting themselves again\". As the only Somerset second eleven match that McMahon played in at Midsomer Norton was right at the end of the 1957 season, this may have been the final straw. But in any case there had been \"an embarrassing episode at Swansea's Grand Hotel\" earlier in the season, also involving Jim Hilton, who was also dismissed at the end of the season. Team-mates and club members petitioned for McMahon to be reinstated, but the county club was not to be moved.\nAfter a period in Lancashire League cricket with Milnrow Cricket Club, McMahon moved back to London where he did office work, later contributing some articles to cricket magazines.\n\n\n== Notes and references ==\nPassage 9:\nAvital Tamir\nAvital Tamir (Hebrew: \u05d0\u05d1\u05d9\u05d8\u05dc \u05ea\u05de\u05d9\u05e8) is an Israeli musician best known for his work as the lead singer for metal band Betzefer and for his experimental pop trio On Shoulders of Giants.

In 2005, the band released its first full-length album Down Low.\nTamir was the vocalist for the band since its formation and appeared on all of the band's releases, until his departure in 2016. He was replaced by Aharon Ragoza.\n\nNail Within (2003, 2007)\nIn 2003, after Nail Within vocalist Yishay Swearts left, guitarist Matan Cohen brought his Betzefer bandmates Avital Tamir (on vocals) and Rotem Inbar (on bass) to play with the band. After few rehearsals the idea fell through and the band disbanded. Although, before those events, Tamir did guest on some live shows of Nail Within. \n\nIn 2007, before reuniting the whole line-up, Cohen brought Tamir once again to rehearse with the band.

He went to England at the end of World War II as a member of the Royal Air Force, and settled in Kidderminster in Worcestershire in 1947, where he worked as a civilian lorry driver for the RAF. He began playing for Kidderminster Cricket Club in the Birmingham League, and at the start of the 1952 season, opening the bowling for the club's senior team, he had figures of 7 for 9 and 7 for 37.Worcestershire invited him to play for them, and he made his first-class debut against Sussex in July 1952. He took five wickets in the match (his maiden victim being Ken Suttle) and then held on for 4 not out with Peter Richardson (20 not out) to add the 12 runs needed for a one-wicket victory after his county had collapsed from 192 for 2 to 238 for 9. A week later he claimed four wickets against Warwickshire, then a few days later still he managed 6 for 52 (five of his victims bowled) in what was otherwise a disastrous innings defeat to Derbyshire. In the last match of the season he took a career-best 6 for 51 against Glamorgan; he and Reg Perks (4 for 59) bowled unchanged throughout the first innings. Worcestershire won the game and Lobban finished the season with 23 wickets at 23.69.He took 23 wickets again in 1953, but at a considerably worse average of 34.43, and had only two really successful games: against Oxford University in June, when he took 5 for 70, and then against Sussex in July. On this occasion Lobban claimed eight wickets, his most in a match, including 6 for 103 in the first innings. He also made his highest score with the bat, 18, but Sussex won by five wickets.In 1954 Lobban made only two first-class appearances, and managed only the single wicket of Gloucestershire tail-ender Bomber Wells. In his final game, against Warwickshire at Dudley, his nine first-innings overs cost 51. He bowled just two overs in the second innings as Warwickshire completed an easy ten-wicket win. Lobban played one more Second XI game, against Glamorgan II at Cardiff Arms Park; in this he picked up five wickets.\nHe was also a professional boxer and played rugby union for Kidderminster.He later moved to Canada, where he worked as a teacher in Burnaby, British Columbia.

In consecutive seasons, 1876\u201377 and 1877\u201378, playing for Canterbury, he made the highest score in the short New Zealand first-class season: 76 and 75 respectively. His 76 came in his first match for Canterbury, against Otago. He went to the wicket early on the first day with the score at 7 for 2 and put on 99 for the third wicket with Charles Corfe before he was out with the score at 106 for 3 after a \"very fine exhibition of free hitting, combined with good defence\". Canterbury were all out for 133, but went on to win the match. His 75 came in the next season's match against Otago, when he took the score from 22 for 2 to 136 for 6. The New Zealand cricket historian Tom Reese said, \"Right from the beginning he smote the bowling hip and thigh, going out of his ground to indulge in some forceful driving.\" Canterbury won again.Moore led the batting averages in the Canterbury Cricket Association in 1877\u201378 with 379 runs at an average of 34.4. Also in 1877\u201378, he was a member of the Canterbury team that inflicted the only defeat on the touring Australians.

In the first innings of his first match, against Lancashire at The Oval, he took five wickets for 81 runs.In his first full season, 1948, he was Surrey's leading wicket-taker and in the last home game of the season he was awarded his county cap \u2013 he celebrated by taking eight Northamptonshire wickets for 46 runs at The Oval, six of them coming in the space of 6.3 overs for seven runs. This would remain the best bowling performance of his first-class career, not surpassed, but he did equal it seven years later. In the following game, the last away match of the season, he took 10 Hampshire wickets for 150 runs in the match at Bournemouth. In the 1948 season as a whole, he took 91 wickets at an average of 28.07. As a tail-end left-handed batsman, he managed just 93 runs in the season at an average of 4.22.The emergence of Tony Lock as a slow left-arm bowler in 1949 brought a stuttering end of McMahon's Surrey career. Though he played in 12 first-class matches in the 1949 season, McMahon took only 19 wickets; a similar number of matches in 1950 brought 34 wickets. In 1951, he played just seven times and in 1952 only three times. In 1953, Lock split the first finger of his left hand, and played in only 11 of Surrey's County Championship matches; McMahon played as his deputy in 14 Championship matches, though a measure of their comparative merits was that Lock's 11 games produced 67 wickets at 12.38 runs apiece, while McMahon's 14 games brought him 45 wickets at the, for him, low average of 21.53. At the end of the 1953 season, McMahon was allowed to leave Surrey to join Somerset, then languishing at the foot of the County Championship and recruiting widely from other counties and other countries.\n\nSomerset cricketer\nSomerset's slow bowling in 1954 was in the hands of leg-spinner Johnny Lawrence, with support from the off-spin of Jim Hilton while promising off-spinner Brian Langford was on national service. McMahon filled a vacancy for a left-arm orthodox spinner that had been there since the retirement of Horace Hazell at the end of the 1952 season; Hazell's apparent successor, Roy Smith, had failed to realise his promise as a bowler in 1953, though his batting had advanced significantly.\nMcMahon instantly became a first-team regular and played in almost every match during his four years with the county, not missing a single Championship game until he was controversially dropped from the side in August 1957, after which he did not play in the Championship again.In the 1954 season, McMahon, alongside fellow newcomer Hilton, was something of a disappointment, according to Wisden: \"The new spin bowlers, McMahon and Hilton, did not attain to the best standards of their craft in a wet summer, yet, like the rest of the attack, they would have fared better with reasonable support in the field and from their own batsmen,\" it said. McMahon took 85 wickets at an average of 27.47 (Hilton took only 42 at a higher average). His best match was against Essex at Weston-super-Mare where he took six for 96 in the first innings and five for 45 in the second to finish with match figures of 11 for 141, which were the best of his career. He was awarded his county cap in the 1954 season, but Somerset remained at the bottom of the table.\nThe figures for the 1955 were similar: McMahon this time took 75 wickets at 28.77 apiece. There was a small improvement in his batting and the arrival of Bryan Lobb elevated McMahon to No 10 in the batting order for most of the season, and he responded with 262 runs and an average of 9.03. This included his highest-ever score, 24, made in the match against Sussex at Frome. A week later in Somerset's next match, he equalled his best-ever bowling performance, taking eight Kent wickets for 46 runs in the first innings of a match at Yeovil through what Wisden called \"clever variation of flight and spin\". These matches brought two victories for Somerset, but there were only two others in the 1955 season and the side finished at the bottom of the Championship for the fourth season running.At the end of the 1955 season, Lawrence retired and McMahon became Somerset's senior spin bowler for the 1956 season, with Langford returning from National Service as the main support. McMahon responded with his most successful season so far, taking 103 wickets at an average of 25.57, the only season in his career in which he exceeded 100 wickets. The bowling average improved still further in 1957 to 23.10 when McMahon took 86 wickets. But his season came to an abrupt end in mid-August 1957 when, after 108 consecutive Championship matches, he was dropped from the first team during the Weston-super-Mare festival. Though he played some games for the second eleven later in August, he regained his place in the first team for only a single end-of-season friendly match, and he was told that his services were not required for the future, a decision, said Wisden, that \"proved highly controversial\".\n\nSacked by Somerset\nThe reason behind McMahon's sacking did not become public knowledge for many years. In its obituary of him in 2002, McMahon was described by Wisden as \"a man who embraced the antipodean virtues of candour and conviviality\". It went on: \"Legend tells of a night at the Flying Horse Inn in Nottingham when he beheaded the gladioli with an ornamental sword, crying: 'When Mac drinks, everybody drinks!'\" The obituary recounts a further escapade in second eleven match at Midsomer Norton where a curfew imposed on the team was circumvented by \"a POW-type loop\" organised by McMahon, \"with his team-mates escaping through a ground-storey window and then presenting themselves again\". As the only Somerset second eleven match that McMahon played in at Midsomer Norton was right at the end of the 1957 season, this may have been the final straw. But in any case there had been \"an embarrassing episode at Swansea's Grand Hotel\" earlier in the season, also involving Jim Hilton, who was also dismissed at the end of the season. Team-mates and club members petitioned for McMahon to be reinstated, but the county club was not to be moved.\nAfter a period in Lancashire League cricket with Milnrow Cricket Club, McMahon moved back to London where he did office work, later contributing some articles to cricket magazines.\n\n\n== Notes and references ==\nPassage 9:\nAvital Tamir\nAvital Tamir (Hebrew: \u05d0\u05d1\u05d9\u05d8\u05dc \u05ea\u05de\u05d9\u05e8) is an Israeli musician best known for his work as the lead singer for metal band Betzefer and for his experimental pop trio On Shoulders of Giants. He was also briefly a member of fellow Betzefer bandmate Matan Cohen's death metal band Nail Within.\n\nMusical career\nBetzefer (1998\u20132016)\nAvital Tamir formed Betzefer along with guitarist Matan Cohen and drummer Roey Berman as a one-off band for a high school gig in 1998.\nWhat started as a high school gig became a big part of the lives of the band members and since then the band started working, first as a cover band and later they started recording their own material, releasing Pitz Aachbar in 2000 and the EP New Hate in 2003. In 2005, the band released its first full-length album Down Low.\nTamir was the vocalist for the band since its formation and appeared on all of the band's releases, until his departure in 2016. He was replaced by Aharon Ragoza.\n\nNail Within (2003, 2007)\nIn 2003, after Nail Within vocalist Yishay Swearts left, guitarist Matan Cohen brought his Betzefer bandmates Avital Tamir (on vocals) and Rotem Inbar (on bass) to play with the band. After few rehearsals the idea fell through and the band disbanded. Although, before those events, Tamir did guest on some live shows of Nail Within. \n\nIn 2007, before reuniting the whole line-up, Cohen brought Tamir once again to rehearse with the band. Again, the collaboration wasn't long and soon the whole old line-up reunited.\nIt is being rumored that Avital Tamir, along with Betzefer bassist Rotem Inbar, will be involved in the new proposed album by Nail Within, though this wasn't confirmed, but it is known that Matan Cohen, Avital Tamir and Rotem Inbar, are all active in Nail Within.\n\nOn Shoulders of Giants (2006\u2013present)\nIn 2006, Avital took time off from touring with Betzefer to start a new project dubbed On Shoulders of Giants together with 7% Mind Usage guitarist Idan Epshtein and Jerusalem based singer Katie Danielson. The three recorded their debut album titled Come Crashing, which was released independently on September 17, 2009. Avital handled most of the guitar duties on the record as well as the vocals, and the bass.\n\nBlack Swan (2010\u2013present)\nIn early 2010, Tamir has started the alternative/garage rock band Black Swan with ex-Got No Shame lead guitarist Matan Ergas (AKA Nose). The band has played extensively in Israel through 2010 while Betzefer was on hiatus, playing both full band electric shows, as well as many stripped-down acoustic shows, even playing one whole show in two parts: opening with acoustic and main show as a full-band.\nThe band has recorded several demos which were upped to the band's Facebook page. The band planned to record the album sometime in 2011. Around that time, Tamir promoted Betzefer's second album Freedom to the Slave Makers released in February 2011.\n\nDiscography\nBetzefer\nPitz Aachbar (2000)\nSome Tits, But No Bush (2001)\nNew Hate (2003)\nDown Low (2005)\nFreedom to The Slave Makers (2011)\nThe Devil Went Down to the Holy Land (2013)\n\nOn Shoulders of Giants\nCome Crashing (2009)\nPassage 10:\nTom Dickinson\nThomas or Tom Dickinson may refer to: \n\nThomas Dickenson, or Dickinson, merchant and politician of York, England\nThomas R.

French director Abel Gance's Napol\u00e9on (1927) had a final widescreen segment in what Gance called Polyvision. Paramount released Old Ironsides (1927), with two sequences in a widescreen process called \"Magnascope\", while MGM released Trail of '98 (1928) in a widescreen process called \"Fanthom Screen\".The film features an array of stars who were contracted to William Fox's  Fox Film Corporation at that time, including Marjorie White, Will Rogers, Charles Farrell, Janet Gaynor, George Jessel, El Brendel, Ann Pennington, Victor McLaglen, Dixie Lee, Edmund Lowe, and Frank Richardson. It also featured the first appearance of Betty Grable on film, aged 12, as a chorus girl, and Sir Harry Lauder's nephew, Harry Lauder II, a conductor for Fox, who was drafted into the chorus.\n\nPlot\nOriginally titled New Orleans Frolic, the story centers around Margie (played by Marjorie White), a singer on a showboat who, when she hears that the showboat is in financial trouble, travels to New York City in an effort to persuade all the boat's former stars to perform in a show to rescue it. She is successful and the stars all fly to New Orleans to surprise the showboat's owner, Colonel Billy Blacher, with a grand show, the proceeds of which will go to rescue the showboat.\n\nCast\nCharles E.

It was also shown in Grandeur at the Carthay Circle Theatre in Los Angeles, from February 28, 1930.\nAt a screening at the Roxy Theater, film critic Mordaunt Hall praised the cinematography, which was noted to be enhanced by the wider format. However, he regarded the film itself as \"not one that gives as full a conception of the possibilities as future films of this type will probably do.\"Owing to the Great Depression, few movie theaters invested in equipment for this format and it was soon abandoned. Fox Film Corporation's heavy investment in Grandeur technology led to William Fox losing his business, which was eventually merged in 1935 with Twentieth Century Pictures to form 20th Century Fox.

French director Abel Gance's Napol\u00e9on (1927) had a final widescreen segment in what Gance called Polyvision.

It was also shown in Grandeur at the Carthay Circle Theatre in Los Angeles, from February 28, 1930.\nAt a screening at the Roxy Theater, film critic Mordaunt Hall praised the cinematography, which was noted to be enhanced by the wider format. However, he regarded the film itself as \"not one that gives as full a conception of the possibilities as future films of this type will probably do.\"Owing to the Great Depression, few movie theaters invested in equipment for this format and it was soon abandoned. Fox Film Corporation's heavy investment in Grandeur technology led to William Fox losing his business, which was eventually merged in 1935 with Twentieth Century Pictures to form 20th Century Fox.

He directed more than 90 films between 1934 and 1978. His 1958 film That Won't Keep a Sailor Down was entered into the 1st Moscow International Film Festival. Two years later, his 1960 film Big Request Concert was entered into the 2nd Moscow International Film Festival. His career encompassed both Nazi cinema and West German productions. He also wrote several books on the 1930s and 1940s wave of German cinema.\n\nCareer\nIn his early teens, Rabenalt began his stage career directing operas at theatres in Darmstadt, Berlin and Gera. From then on to the mid-1920s he worked (though uncredited) as a production assistant on several films such including G. W. Pabst's Joyless Street (1925). After Nazi's rise to power, Rabenalt made his feature film debut directing the musical comedy, What Am I Without You (1934), which was then shortly followed with the release of the comedy Pappi (1934). He continued to work in different genres, including The Love of the Maharaja (1936), and Men Are That Way and Midsummer Night's Fire which were released in 1939.        \nThrough out the 1940s, Rabaenalt worked with melodramatic dramas and comedy. Some of his early films in the 1940s, such as Riding for Germany, supported Nazi ideology. In 1989, he said \"I had only made circus films and chamber-type entertainment films since 1941. The only Nazi film I knew was ... rides for Germany (1941), and it was admired. The first films of mine that were distributed again after the war were Circus Renz (1943) and Regimental Music (shot in 1944 under the title The Guilty of Gabriele Rottweil, the film only came to the cinemas in 1950). The controversy about ... rides for Germany came much later.After the war he resumed his stage career as a director, beginning with the East German production, Chemistry and Love (1948), satire on anti-capitalism based on a play by Bela Balasz.

During World War II, when he was 13, he left his parents home and lived alone in Budapest. During the Holocaust, his mother and two younger sisters were murdered, while his father, brother and older sister were saved. Later, he was taken to a labor camp in Yugoslavia and worked in copper mining until he was liberated by local partisans, whom he joined in fighting the Germans until his immigration to Palestine in 1944 at age 18. Atzmoni wanted to join the military, but was concerned that his slim figure would cause him to be rejected, so he said he was two years older than he was.\n\nMilitary career\nAfter immigrating to Palestine, Atzmoni joined the Jewish Settlement Police and dealt with Naharayim. Following an Arab Legion attack, he retreated with the guards and reached the nearby base of the 12th Battalion of the Golani Brigade. He joined the ranks of the brigade and after a sergeant course was stationed as a company sergeant and served in this position during the 1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War. Later, He joined the artillery corps, where he served in reserves for many years. In 1969, following severe manpower shortage in the Israel Defense Forces, he responded to a request by its Chief of General Staff and returned for a year of voluntary service in the artillery corps.\n\nDecorations\nIn September 1948, Atzmoni cleared a fire-focused ammunition box during battle and received a commendation from the brigade commander.In January 1949, Atzmoni's unit was attacked near Rafah. A military car was blocking the artillery's line of sight, preventing an effective response. Atzmoni ran, under heavy fire, and was able to start the car and move it, thus clearing the way for the artillery to act and destroy 18 enemy vehicles. For this he was awarded the Hero of Israel commendation, which is the highest commendation ever awarded by the IDF, given to only twelve soldiers:\n\n On January 4, 1949, in the battle for the cemetery in Rafah, our artillery car was stopped in the field and the entire sector was concealed in front of our cannon position. The enemy, which attacked tanks and armored vehicles accompanied by infantry, rained fire on the outpost and prevented any action to remove the car from the area. Lt. Col. Arieh Otzmany, whose job was to bring ammunition and digging equipment to the outpost, jumped at the car, managed to start it, and drove it from the front to the rear, enabling our anti-tank cannon to launch an operation that resulted in the use of nine tanks and other enemy vehicles.\n\nLater life and death\nFollowing his discharge from the military, Atzmoni settled in the Hadar neighborhood in Haifa with his wife Lea (n\u00e9e Lustig), and worked as a cab driver. Concurrently, he imported and sold car parts. The two then established the Haifa branch of car rental company Hertz, which flourished. They then established their own car rental agency, also successful, allowing him donate some earnings to charity. After decades, the couple retired to the Ahuza retirement home. He died on March 30, 2005, and was buried in Haifa with a military ceremony. He had a son, daughter and four grandchildren.\nPassage 10:\nThe Hero of My Dreams\nThe Hero of My Dreams (German: Der Held meiner Tr\u00e4ume) is a 1960 West German romantic comedy film directed by Arthur Maria Rabenalt and starring Carlos Thompson, Heidi Br\u00fchl and Peter Vogel.It was shot at the Bavaria Studios in Munich.

He directed more than 90 films between 1934 and 1978. His 1958 film That Won't Keep a Sailor Down was entered into the 1st Moscow International Film Festival. Two years later, his 1960 film Big Request Concert was entered into the 2nd Moscow International Film Festival. His career encompassed both Nazi cinema and West German productions. He also wrote several books on the 1930s and 1940s wave of German cinema.\n\nCareer\nIn his early teens, Rabenalt began his stage career directing operas at theatres in Darmstadt, Berlin and Gera. From then on to the mid-1920s he worked (though uncredited) as a production assistant on several films such including G. W. Pabst's Joyless Street (1925). After Nazi's rise to power, Rabenalt made his feature film debut directing the musical comedy, What Am I Without You (1934), which was then shortly followed with the release of the comedy Pappi (1934). He continued to work in different genres, including The Love of the Maharaja (1936), and Men Are That Way and Midsummer Night's Fire which were released in 1939.        \nThrough out the 1940s, Rabaenalt worked with melodramatic dramas and comedy. Some of his early films in the 1940s, such as Riding for Germany, supported Nazi ideology. In 1989, he said \"I had only made circus films and chamber-type entertainment films since 1941. The only Nazi film I knew was ... rides for Germany (1941), and it was admired. The first films of mine that were distributed again after the war were Circus Renz (1943) and Regimental Music (shot in 1944 under the title The Guilty of Gabriele Rottweil, the film only came to the cinemas in 1950). The controversy about ... rides for Germany came much later.After the war he resumed his stage career as a director, beginning with the East German production, Chemistry and Love (1948), satire on anti-capitalism based on a play by Bela Balasz. He continued to work on productions for East German state studio DEFA until 1948. In the 1950s, he moved into more mainstream entertainment, including the Weimar horror remake of Alraune (1952), which starred Hildegard Knef and Erich von Stroheim.            \nFrom 1960, Rabanalt worked only in television, adapting classic comedies and operettas for a mainstream audience.

During World War II, when he was 13, he left his parents home and lived alone in Budapest. During the Holocaust, his mother and two younger sisters were murdered, while his father, brother and older sister were saved. Later, he was taken to a labor camp in Yugoslavia and worked in copper mining until he was liberated by local partisans, whom he joined in fighting the Germans until his immigration to Palestine in 1944 at age 18. Atzmoni wanted to join the military, but was concerned that his slim figure would cause him to be rejected, so he said he was two years older than he was.\n\nMilitary career\nAfter immigrating to Palestine, Atzmoni joined the Jewish Settlement Police and dealt with Naharayim. Following an Arab Legion attack, he retreated with the guards and reached the nearby base of the 12th Battalion of the Golani Brigade. He joined the ranks of the brigade and after a sergeant course was stationed as a company sergeant and served in this position during the 1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War. Later, He joined the artillery corps, where he served in reserves for many years. In 1969, following severe manpower shortage in the Israel Defense Forces, he responded to a request by its Chief of General Staff and returned for a year of voluntary service in the artillery corps.\n\nDecorations\nIn September 1948, Atzmoni cleared a fire-focused ammunition box during battle and received a commendation from the brigade commander.In January 1949, Atzmoni's unit was attacked near Rafah. A military car was blocking the artillery's line of sight, preventing an effective response. Atzmoni ran, under heavy fire, and was able to start the car and move it, thus clearing the way for the artillery to act and destroy 18 enemy vehicles. For this he was awarded the Hero of Israel commendation, which is the highest commendation ever awarded by the IDF, given to only twelve soldiers:\n\n On January 4, 1949, in the battle for the cemetery in Rafah, our artillery car was stopped in the field and the entire sector was concealed in front of our cannon position. The enemy, which attacked tanks and armored vehicles accompanied by infantry, rained fire on the outpost and prevented any action to remove the car from the area. Lt. Col. Arieh Otzmany, whose job was to bring ammunition and digging equipment to the outpost, jumped at the car, managed to start it, and drove it from the front to the rear, enabling our anti-tank cannon to launch an operation that resulted in the use of nine tanks and other enemy vehicles.\n\nLater life and death\nFollowing his discharge from the military, Atzmoni settled in the Hadar neighborhood in Haifa with his wife Lea (n\u00e9e Lustig), and worked as a cab driver. Concurrently, he imported and sold car parts. The two then established the Haifa branch of car rental company Hertz, which flourished. They then established their own car rental agency, also successful, allowing him donate some earnings to charity. After decades, the couple retired to the Ahuza retirement home. He died on March 30, 2005, and was buried in Haifa with a military ceremony. He had a son, daughter and four grandchildren.\nPassage 10:\nThe Hero of My Dreams\nThe Hero of My Dreams (German: Der Held meiner Tr\u00e4ume) is a 1960 West German romantic comedy film directed by Arthur Maria Rabenalt and starring Carlos Thompson, Heidi Br\u00fchl and Peter Vogel.It was shot at the Bavaria Studios in Munich.

He is best known for his recordings of \"Skylark\" and \"'Round Midnight\" from the late 1940s to the early 1950s.\n\nMusic career\nEarly years\nParis was born and raised in Nutley, New Jersey, to an Italian-American family, where he attended Nutley High School. His uncle Chick had been a guitarist with Paul Whiteman's orchestra. Paris was a popular child entertainer in vaudeville who shared the stage with Bill \"Bojangles\" Robinson and the Mills Brothers. He tap danced from his youth and into his years in the US Army.\nAfter serving in the army during World War II, he was inspired by his friend Nat King Cole to assemble a trio featuring himself on guitar and vocals. The Jackie Paris Trio was a hit at the Onyx Club on New York's 52nd Street.\n\nRecording and performing\nHe recorded from the 1940s into the 2000s. His albums include Songs by Jackie Paris (EmArcy), Jackie Paris Sings the Lyrics of Ira Gershwin (Time), and The Song Is Paris (Impulse!). The first song that he recorded was \"Skylark\", on one of two sessions made by his trio for MGM Records in 1947. He recorded Thelonious Monk's \"Round Midnight\", which was produced by the critic Leonard Feather and featured a young Dick Hyman on piano.\nIn 1949, he toured with the Lionel Hampton Orchestra and was invited to join Duke Ellington's Orchestra, but he was too exhausted to take it. Paris was part of the Lionel Hampton Orchestra that played at the famed Cavalcade of Jazz in Los Angeles at Wrigley Field which was produced by Leon Hefflin Sr. on July 10, 1949. They did a second concert at Lane Field in San Diego on September 3, 1949. He was the only vocalist to tour as a regular member of the Charlie Parker Quintet. Unfortunately, no recordings exist of the Parker\u2013Paris combination, but there is a photograph of the two working together. He worked often with Charles Mingus, who called Paris his favorite singer and recorded with him often, including 1952's \"Paris in Blue\" and \"Duke Ellington's Sound of Love\" on the album Changes Two in 1974.\nDuring the 1960s\u201370s, Paris frequently performed with his wife at the time Anne Marie Moss.Paris performed or recorded with Bobby Scott, Charlie Shavers, Coleman Hawkins, Dizzy Gillespie, Donald Byrd, Eddie Costa, Gigi Gryce, Hank Jones, Joe Wilder, Johnny Mandel, Lee Konitz, Max Roach, Neal Hefti, Oscar Pettiford, Ralph Burns, Terry Gibbs, Tony Scott, and Wynton Kelly.\nA documentary about him, 'Tis Autumn: The Search for Jackie Paris came out in 2006.\n\nRecognition\nHe won many jazz polls and awards, including those of Down Beat, Playboy, Swing Journal, and Metronome. In 1953, he was named Best New Male Vocalist of the Year in the first Down Beat Critics Poll. The winning female vocalist was Ella Fitzgerald, who repeatedly named Paris as one of her favorites.\nIn 2001, Paris played to a standing room crowd \u2013 and to a standing ovation \u2013 at New York's Birdland jazz club in Times Square. He was virtually the only performer to have appeared at every incarnation of the famed night spot, from the legendary Birdland of the 1950s to the present.\nHe was praised by comic Lenny Bruce, who shared the bill with him on many occasions. Bruce said, \"I dig his talent. The audience loves him and he gets laughs. He is too much!\"\n\nAwards and honors\nNew Star Male Vocalist, Down Beat Critics Poll, 1953\nBest Male Vocalist, Playboy Musicians & Critics Poll, 1957\u20131961\nGold Disc Award, Lucky to Be Me, Swing Journal, 1989\n\nDiscography\nSongs by Jackie Paris (Wing, 1956)\nSkylark (Brunswick, 1957)\nThe Jackie Paris Sound (EastWest, 1958)\nThe Song Is Paris (Impulse!, 1962)\nSings the Lyrics of Ira Gershwin (Time, 1962)\nLive at the Maisonette with Anne Marie Moss (Differant Drummer, 1975)\nJackie Paris (Audiophile, 1981)\nNobody Else but Me (Audiophile, 1988)\nLucky to Be Me (EmArcy, 1989)\nLove Songs (EmArcy, 1990)\nThe Intimate Jackie Paris (Hudson, 2001)\nPassage 9:\n55 (number)\n55 (fifty-five) is the natural number following 54 and preceding 56.\n\nMathematics\n55 is \n\na triangular number (the sum of the consecutive numbers 1 to 10), and a doubly triangular number.\nthe 10th Fibonacci number.

He is best known for his recordings of \"Skylark\" and \"'Round Midnight\" from the late 1940s to the early 1950s.\n\nMusic career\nEarly years\nParis was born and raised in Nutley, New Jersey, to an Italian-American family, where he attended Nutley High School. His uncle Chick had been a guitarist with Paul Whiteman's orchestra. Paris was a popular child entertainer in vaudeville who shared the stage with Bill \"Bojangles\" Robinson and the Mills Brothers. He tap danced from his youth and into his years in the US Army.\nAfter serving in the army during World War II, he was inspired by his friend Nat King Cole to assemble a trio featuring himself on guitar and vocals. The Jackie Paris Trio was a hit at the Onyx Club on New York's 52nd Street.\n\nRecording and performing\nHe recorded from the 1940s into the 2000s. His albums include Songs by Jackie Paris (EmArcy), Jackie Paris Sings the Lyrics of Ira Gershwin (Time), and The Song Is Paris (Impulse!). The first song that he recorded was \"Skylark\", on one of two sessions made by his trio for MGM Records in 1947. He recorded Thelonious Monk's \"Round Midnight\", which was produced by the critic Leonard Feather and featured a young Dick Hyman on piano.\nIn 1949, he toured with the Lionel Hampton Orchestra and was invited to join Duke Ellington's Orchestra, but he was too exhausted to take it. Paris was part of the Lionel Hampton Orchestra that played at the famed Cavalcade of Jazz in Los Angeles at Wrigley Field which was produced by Leon Hefflin Sr. on July 10, 1949. They did a second concert at Lane Field in San Diego on September 3, 1949. He was the only vocalist to tour as a regular member of the Charlie Parker Quintet. Unfortunately, no recordings exist of the Parker\u2013Paris combination, but there is a photograph of the two working together. He worked often with Charles Mingus, who called Paris his favorite singer and recorded with him often, including 1952's \"Paris in Blue\" and \"Duke Ellington's Sound of Love\" on the album Changes Two in 1974.\nDuring the 1960s\u201370s, Paris frequently performed with his wife at the time Anne Marie Moss.Paris performed or recorded with Bobby Scott, Charlie Shavers, Coleman Hawkins, Dizzy Gillespie, Donald Byrd, Eddie Costa, Gigi Gryce, Hank Jones, Joe Wilder, Johnny Mandel, Lee Konitz, Max Roach, Neal Hefti, Oscar Pettiford, Ralph Burns, Terry Gibbs, Tony Scott, and Wynton Kelly.\nA documentary about him, 'Tis Autumn: The Search for Jackie Paris came out in 2006.\n\nRecognition\nHe won many jazz polls and awards, including those of Down Beat, Playboy, Swing Journal, and Metronome. In 1953, he was named Best New Male Vocalist of the Year in the first Down Beat Critics Poll. The winning female vocalist was Ella Fitzgerald, who repeatedly named Paris as one of her favorites.\nIn 2001, Paris played to a standing room crowd \u2013 and to a standing ovation \u2013 at New York's Birdland jazz club in Times Square. He was virtually the only performer to have appeared at every incarnation of the famed night spot, from the legendary Birdland of the 1950s to the present.\nHe was praised by comic Lenny Bruce, who shared the bill with him on many occasions. Bruce said, \"I dig his talent. The audience loves him and he gets laughs. He is too much!\"\n\nAwards and honors\nNew Star Male Vocalist, Down Beat Critics Poll, 1953\nBest Male Vocalist, Playboy Musicians & Critics Poll, 1957\u20131961\nGold Disc Award, Lucky to Be Me, Swing Journal, 1989\n\nDiscography\nSongs by Jackie Paris (Wing, 1956)\nSkylark (Brunswick, 1957)\nThe Jackie Paris Sound (EastWest, 1958)\nThe Song Is Paris (Impulse!, 1962)\nSings the Lyrics of Ira Gershwin (Time, 1962)\nLive at the Maisonette with Anne Marie Moss (Differant Drummer, 1975)\nJackie Paris (Audiophile, 1981)\nNobody Else but Me (Audiophile, 1988)\nLucky to Be Me (EmArcy, 1989)\nLove Songs (EmArcy, 1990)\nThe Intimate Jackie Paris (Hudson, 2001)\nPassage 9:\n55 (number)\n55 (fifty-five) is the natural number following 54 and preceding 56.\n\nMathematics\n55 is \n\na triangular number (the sum of the consecutive numbers 1 to 10), and a doubly triangular number.\nthe 10th Fibonacci number.

{"prompt": "Answer the question based on the given passages. Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\nAnne Elizabeth Rector\nAnne Elizabeth Rector (June 26, 1899 \u2013 February 17, 1970) was an American artist.\nRector was the daughter of Enoch J. Rector and she attended the Art Students League of New York studying under John French Sloan. Ann also studied landscape painting under Andrew Dasburg. She married Edmund Duffy and they moved to New York City in 1948, when her husband began work for the Saturday Evening Post. She later headed Rector Studios that manufactured glass top tables. Her daughter married Ivan Chermayeff, the son of Serge Ivan Chermayeff.Rector's childhood diaries were published in 2004. They had been found many years after Rector's death and described her life for the year of 1912.\nPassage 2:\nEdmund Duffy\nEdmund Duffy (March 1, 1899 \u2013 September 12, 1962), was an American editorial cartoonist.  He grew up in Jersey City, New Jersey, eventually moving to metropolitan areas. Duffy did not attend high school, but instead went into the Art Students League of New York. Duffy's career took him to London, Paris, New York, and finally to Baltimore, where he spent the majority of his professional career working for The Baltimore Sun.\nDuffy won three Pulitzer Prizes for Editorial Cartooning in 1931, 1934, and 1940. Duffy began working for the Baltimore Sun in 1924, when he was only about 25 years old, and he received high praise from the famous journalist H.L. Mencken.\n\nJournalism career\nDuffy first came into the journalism field with his submission of a page of sketches for Armistice Day. The sketches were put into the New York Tribune in the Sunday section. Duffy worked on a variety of assignments in order to save up money, then launching his European career. He moved to London and worked for the London Evening News. Duffy worked in Paris for a few years, and he finally returned to the United States in 1922. He worked for two years with both the New York Leader and the Brooklyn Eagle.\nThe longest period of his career began in 1924 when he began working for The Baltimore Sun. Duffy worked there until 1948, in order to work a less tiring job, working for the Saturday Evening Post.  Duffy drew numerous noteworthy cartoons, approaching major issues and incidents, such as lynching and the Ku Klux Klan, but also the famous Monkey Scopes Trial of 1925.\n\nDenouncing racism through art\nDuffy was known for his daring nature in relation to his work. H.L. Mencken saw promise in his work and \u201cDuffy with his sometimes savage artwork, did the kind of thing that delighted Mencken, who loved nothing more than to \u2018stir up the animals\u2019\u201d. Duffy was not afraid to please Mencken, and held nothing back  He was one of the few people of his time that would boldly approach the topic of racism.  He blatantly condemned lynching and the actions of the KKK.  This was one of his main issues that he approached during his career.  During the time period that Duffy worked it was not popular to advocate against racism, so Duffy was civil rights before it was a wide movement in the United States. S.L. Harrison, a late professor of Communication at the University of Miami, wrote that Duffy \u201cdisplayed uncommon vigor in attacking the Ku Klux Klan\u201d.\n\nScopes Trial\nJust a year after Duffy began working for The Baltimore Sun, 1925, a famous trial began in Tennessee.  Tennessee had passed a law, the Butler Act, barring teachers against the topic of evolution in the classroom, but one biology teacher, John T. Scopes, ignored the law and taught his students evolution.  Scopes decided that the students should learn evolution, even if it went against the teachings of the bible.  Since the trial was popular and a nationwide topic, Mencken took a staff from The Sun, including Duffy, to cover the trial.  \u201c[Edmund Duffy\u2019s] graphic artwork played a significant role in the public\u2019s perception of the trial proceedings reported in the pages of The Sun, then one of America\u2019s most influential newspapers\u201d.  His cartoons brought more attention to the issue, as he derided Tennessee for crushing knowledge in one of his more notable cartoons from the trial called \u2018A Closed Book in Tennessee.\u2019 \nIn this cartoon, Duffy shows a man, representing Tennessee, holding a sign that says \u201cFundamentalists Only Wanted as Teachers.\u201d  The man is standing on top of the book of knowledge, holding it shut.  Duffy knew that this powerful cartoon would cause a great response, but that is exactly what Mencken wanted and expected from him.  Many more of his cartoons from the trial held the same message, in which he was publicly shaming Tennessee for the law, the trial, and the verdict.  Mencken once said that with a good cartoonist he would not need a whole editorial staff, and a great cartoonist he found in Duffy.\n\nPulitzer Prizes\nOver Edmund Duffy's career, he won three Pulitzer Prizes, which is a lot compared to other recipients over the years.  His three prize winning cartoons are the following:\n\u201cAn Old Struggle Still Going On\u201d (1931)\nThis cartoon references the anti-communism era that began in the 1920s and 1930s.  At the time, communism was seen as being anti-religion, which is what Duffy conveys in the cartoon.  \n\u201cCalifornia Points with Pride!\u201d (1934)\nThis cartoon is one of Duffy's many anti-lynching pieces.  This one, however, deals with white on white lynching.  In California, people took two kidnappers from prison and lynched them in a park, but the Governor praised the people that did the lynching.  Duffy condemned the Governor in this cartoon.\n\u201cThe 'Outstretched Hand'\u201d (1940)\nIn this cartoon, Duffy's topic is Adolf Hitler and his brutality.  By the time the cartoon was drawn, Germany had already invaded Poland, and Duffy shows Hitler's broken promises and peace offerings.  Hitler's hand drips with blood in the image.\nPassage 3:\nAnne Evans\nAnne or Ann Evans may refer to:\n\nAnn Evans (midwife) (1840\u20131916), New Zealand nurse\nAnne Evans (poet) (1820\u20131870), English poet and composer\nAnne Evans (arts patron) (1871\u20131941), art patron in Colorado\nAnne Evans (soprano) (born 1941), British operatic soprano\nAnne Evans Estabrook, American real estate developer\n\nSee also\nMary Ann Evans, writer better known as George Eliot\nMary Anne Disraeli, n\u00e9e Evans, wife of Disraeli\nEvans (surname)\nPassage 4:\nJames Randall Marsh\nJames Randall Marsh (1896\u20131966) was an American artist and the husband of Anne Steele Marsh.\n\nBiography\nMarsh was born in 1896 in Paris, France. He was the son of Frederick Dana Marsh and Alice Randall Marsh. He was the brother of the painter Reginald Marsh.He married Anne Steele in 1925 and the couple settled in Essex Fells, New Jersey. There Marsh set up a metal forge which he used to create industrial and residential lighting fixtures. In 1948, the Marshes relocated to Pittstown, New Jersey where James continued operating a forge, expanding the operation to include decorative metal work. His work was mainly in the American Arts and Craft style.\nIn 1952, Marsh was instrumental in establishing the Hunterdon Art Museum. When an 1836 stone mill became available for sale, Marsh and his neighbors decided to turn it into an art center, with Marsh providing most of the purchase price. The museum, with workshops, is still in operation and the building is listed as Dunham's Mill on the National Register of Historic Places listings in Hunterdon County, New Jersey.In 1964, he purchased the M. C. Mulligan & Sons Quarry, also listed on the NRHP, and donated it to the Clinton Historical Museum, now known as the Red Mill Museum Village. On October 9, 1965, the James Randall Marsh Historical Park was dedicated at the museum.Marsh died on January 20, 1966, in Flemington.\nPassage 5:\nMichael Rector\nMichael Rector (born December 16, 1993) is a former American football wide receiver.

He was waived by the Lions on September 2, 2017.\nPassage 6:\nStan Rice\nStanley Travis Rice Jr. (November 7, 1942 \u2013 December 9, 2002) was an American poet and artist. He was the husband of author Anne Rice.\n\nBiography\nRice was born in Dallas, Texas, in 1942. He met his future wife Anne O'Brien in high school. They briefly attended North Texas State University together, before marrying in 1961 and moving to San Francisco in 1962, to enroll at San Francisco State University, where they both earned their bachelor's and master's degrees.\nRice was a professor of English and Creative Writing at San Francisco State University. In 1977, he received the Academy of American Poets' Edgar Allan Poe Award for Whiteboy, and in subsequent years was also the recipient of the Joseph Henry Jackson Award, as well as a writing fellowship from the National Endowment for the Arts. Rice retired after 22 years as Chairman of the Creative Writing program as well as Assistant Director of the Poetry Center in 1989.It was the death of his and Anne's first child, daughter Michele (1966\u20131972), at age six of leukemia, which led to Stan Rice becoming a published author. His first book of poems, based on his daughter's illness and death, was titled Some Lamb, and was published in 1975. He encouraged his wife to quit her work as a waitress, cook and theater usher in order to devote herself full-time to her writing, and both eventually encouraged their son, novelist Christopher Rice, to become a published author as well.\n\nRice, his wife and his son moved to Garden District, New Orleans, in 1988, where he eventually opened the Stan Rice Gallery. In 1989, they purchased the Brevard-Rice House, 1239 First Street, built in 1857 for Albert Hamilton Brevard.\nStan Rice's paintings are represented in the collections of the Ogden Museum of Southern Art and the New Orleans Museum of Art. He had a one-person show at the James W. Palmer Gallery, Vassar College, Poughkeepsie, New York. The Art Galleries of Southeastern Louisiana presented an exhibition of selected paintings in March 2005. Prospective plans are underway to present exhibitions of Rice's paintings at various locations in Mexico.In Prism of the Night, Anne Rice said of Stan: \"He's a model to me of a man who doesn't look to heaven or hell to justify his feelings about life itself. His capacity for action is admirable. Very early on he said to me, 'What more could you ask for than life itself'?\"\nPoet Deborah Garrison was Rice's editor at Alfred A. Knopf for his 2002 collection, Red to the Rind, which was dedicated to novelist son Christopher, in whose success as a writer his father greatly rejoiced. Garrison said of Rice: \"Stan really attempted to kind of stare down the world, and I admire that.\"Knopf's Victoria Wilson, who edited Anne's novels and worked with Stan Rice on his 1997 book, Paintings, was particularly impressed by his refusal to sell his artworks, saying, \"The great thing about Stan is that he refused to play the game as a painter, and he refused to play the game as a poet.\"\n\nPersonal life\nRice was an atheist.\n\nDeath\nStan Rice died of brain cancer at age 60, on December 9, 2002, in New Orleans where he lived and was survived by Anne and Christopher, as well as his mother, Margaret; a brother, Larry; and two sisters, Nancy and Cynthia.\nRice is entombed in Metairie Cemetery in New Orleans.\n\nPoetry collections\nSome Lamb (1975)\nWhiteboy (1976) (earned the Edgar Allan Poe Award from the Academy of American Poets)\nBody of Work (1983)\nSinging Yet: New and Selected Poems (1992)\nFear Itself (1997)\nThe Radiance of Pigs (1999)\nRed to the Rind (2002)\nFalse Prophet (2003) (Posthumous)\n\nPoetry video recordings\nTwo series of recordings \u2013 one from 1973 at San Francisco State University and the other from 1996 at the poet's New Orleans home by filmmaker Blair Murphy \u2013 capturing Stan Rice reading several of his poems are on the YouTube site dedicated to the poet.\n\nOther books\nPaintings (1997)\n\nFootnotes\nNotes\nPassage 7:\nStan Marks\nStan Marks is an Australian writer and journalist.

He also served as the first gentleman of Rajasthan and also as mayor of Amravati. He was a member of the Indian National Congress.\n\nEarly life\nDevisingh Ramsingh Shekhawat, who was then a lecturer in chemistry, married Pratibha Patil on 7 July 1965. The couple had a daughter and a son, Raosaheb Shekhawat, who is also a politician.Shekhawat was awarded a PhD from the University of Mumbai in 1972. Prior to his wife's elevation to her presidential role, he had been principal of a college operated by his wife's Vidya Bharati Shikshan Sanstha foundation and also a First Mayor of Amravati (1991\u20131992). Like his wife, he was a member of the Indian National Congress party. He was also an agriculturalist and a former member of the Legislative Assembly, being elected for the period 1985\u20131990 from the Amravati constituency in the Maharashtra state legislature. He lost his deposit in the 1995 contest for that constituency.Various accusations against Shekhawat and Patil emerged after the latter was nominated for the office of president. Among these was the case of Kisan Dhage, a teacher in a school run by Vidya Prasarak Shikshan Mandal in Buldana district, who committed suicide in November 1998. He left a note saying that he was committing suicide because he was tired of the mental harassment caused by Shekhawat, who was chairman of the institution, and four others. When the police registered the case as \"accidental death\", Dhage's wife appealed to the Judicial Magistrate First Class (JMFC) in Jalgaon Jamod, a tehsil in Buldana district. The JMFC ordered the police to start criminal proceedings. Shekhawat petitioned the courts seeking dismissal of charges of abetting Dhage's suicide. Two lower courts turned down this plea and by June 2007 the issue was pending in the Bombay High Court.

Rector and she attended the Art Students League of New York studying under John French Sloan. Ann also studied landscape painting under Andrew Dasburg. She married Edmund Duffy and they moved to New York City in 1948, when her husband began work for the Saturday Evening Post. She later headed Rector Studios that manufactured glass top tables. Her daughter married Ivan Chermayeff, the son of Serge Ivan Chermayeff.Rector's childhood diaries were published in 2004. They had been found many years after Rector's death and described her life for the year of 1912.\nPassage 2:\nEdmund Duffy\nEdmund Duffy (March 1, 1899 \u2013 September 12, 1962), was an American editorial cartoonist.  He grew up in Jersey City, New Jersey, eventually moving to metropolitan areas. Duffy did not attend high school, but instead went into the Art Students League of New York. Duffy's career took him to London, Paris, New York, and finally to Baltimore, where he spent the majority of his professional career working for The Baltimore Sun.\nDuffy won three Pulitzer Prizes for Editorial Cartooning in 1931, 1934, and 1940. Duffy began working for the Baltimore Sun in 1924, when he was only about 25 years old, and he received high praise from the famous journalist H.L. Mencken.\n\nJournalism career\nDuffy first came into the journalism field with his submission of a page of sketches for Armistice Day. The sketches were put into the New York Tribune in the Sunday section. Duffy worked on a variety of assignments in order to save up money, then launching his European career. He moved to London and worked for the London Evening News. Duffy worked in Paris for a few years, and he finally returned to the United States in 1922. He worked for two years with both the New York Leader and the Brooklyn Eagle.\nThe longest period of his career began in 1924 when he began working for The Baltimore Sun. Duffy worked there until 1948, in order to work a less tiring job, working for the Saturday Evening Post.  Duffy drew numerous noteworthy cartoons, approaching major issues and incidents, such as lynching and the Ku Klux Klan, but also the famous Monkey Scopes Trial of 1925.\n\nDenouncing racism through art\nDuffy was known for his daring nature in relation to his work. H.L. Mencken saw promise in his work and \u201cDuffy with his sometimes savage artwork, did the kind of thing that delighted Mencken, who loved nothing more than to \u2018stir up the animals\u2019\u201d. Duffy was not afraid to please Mencken, and held nothing back  He was one of the few people of his time that would boldly approach the topic of racism.  He blatantly condemned lynching and the actions of the KKK.  This was one of his main issues that he approached during his career.  During the time period that Duffy worked it was not popular to advocate against racism, so Duffy was civil rights before it was a wide movement in the United States. S.L. Harrison, a late professor of Communication at the University of Miami, wrote that Duffy \u201cdisplayed uncommon vigor in attacking the Ku Klux Klan\u201d.\n\nScopes Trial\nJust a year after Duffy began working for The Baltimore Sun, 1925, a famous trial began in Tennessee.  Tennessee had passed a law, the Butler Act, barring teachers against the topic of evolution in the classroom, but one biology teacher, John T. Scopes, ignored the law and taught his students evolution.  Scopes decided that the students should learn evolution, even if it went against the teachings of the bible.  Since the trial was popular and a nationwide topic, Mencken took a staff from The Sun, including Duffy, to cover the trial.  \u201c[Edmund Duffy\u2019s] graphic artwork played a significant role in the public\u2019s perception of the trial proceedings reported in the pages of The Sun, then one of America\u2019s most influential newspapers\u201d.  His cartoons brought more attention to the issue, as he derided Tennessee for crushing knowledge in one of his more notable cartoons from the trial called \u2018A Closed Book in Tennessee.\u2019 \nIn this cartoon, Duffy shows a man, representing Tennessee, holding a sign that says \u201cFundamentalists Only Wanted as Teachers.\u201d  The man is standing on top of the book of knowledge, holding it shut.  Duffy knew that this powerful cartoon would cause a great response, but that is exactly what Mencken wanted and expected from him.  Many more of his cartoons from the trial held the same message, in which he was publicly shaming Tennessee for the law, the trial, and the verdict.  Mencken once said that with a good cartoonist he would not need a whole editorial staff, and a great cartoonist he found in Duffy.\n\nPulitzer Prizes\nOver Edmund Duffy's career, he won three Pulitzer Prizes, which is a lot compared to other recipients over the years.  His three prize winning cartoons are the following:\n\u201cAn Old Struggle Still Going On\u201d (1931)\nThis cartoon references the anti-communism era that began in the 1920s and 1930s.  At the time, communism was seen as being anti-religion, which is what Duffy conveys in the cartoon.  \n\u201cCalifornia Points with Pride!\u201d (1934)\nThis cartoon is one of Duffy's many anti-lynching pieces.  This one, however, deals with white on white lynching.  In California, people took two kidnappers from prison and lynched them in a park, but the Governor praised the people that did the lynching.  Duffy condemned the Governor in this cartoon.\n\u201cThe 'Outstretched Hand'\u201d (1940)\nIn this cartoon, Duffy's topic is Adolf Hitler and his brutality.  By the time the cartoon was drawn, Germany had already invaded Poland, and Duffy shows Hitler's broken promises and peace offerings.  Hitler's hand drips with blood in the image.\nPassage 3:\nAnne Evans\nAnne or Ann Evans may refer to:\n\nAnn Evans (midwife) (1840\u20131916), New Zealand nurse\nAnne Evans (poet) (1820\u20131870), English poet and composer\nAnne Evans (arts patron) (1871\u20131941), art patron in Colorado\nAnne Evans (soprano) (born 1941), British operatic soprano\nAnne Evans Estabrook, American real estate developer\n\nSee also\nMary Ann Evans, writer better known as George Eliot\nMary Anne Disraeli, n\u00e9e Evans, wife of Disraeli\nEvans (surname)\nPassage 4:\nJames Randall Marsh\nJames Randall Marsh (1896\u20131966) was an American artist and the husband of Anne Steele Marsh.\n\nBiography\nMarsh was born in 1896 in Paris, France. He was the son of Frederick Dana Marsh and Alice Randall Marsh. He was the brother of the painter Reginald Marsh.He married Anne Steele in 1925 and the couple settled in Essex Fells, New Jersey. There Marsh set up a metal forge which he used to create industrial and residential lighting fixtures. In 1948, the Marshes relocated to Pittstown, New Jersey where James continued operating a forge, expanding the operation to include decorative metal work. His work was mainly in the American Arts and Craft style.\nIn 1952, Marsh was instrumental in establishing the Hunterdon Art Museum. When an 1836 stone mill became available for sale, Marsh and his neighbors decided to turn it into an art center, with Marsh providing most of the purchase price. The museum, with workshops, is still in operation and the building is listed as Dunham's Mill on the National Register of Historic Places listings in Hunterdon County, New Jersey.In 1964, he purchased the M. C. Mulligan & Sons Quarry, also listed on the NRHP, and donated it to the Clinton Historical Museum, now known as the Red Mill Museum Village.

Rice retired after 22 years as Chairman of the Creative Writing program as well as Assistant Director of the Poetry Center in 1989.It was the death of his and Anne's first child, daughter Michele (1966\u20131972), at age six of leukemia, which led to Stan Rice becoming a published author. His first book of poems, based on his daughter's illness and death, was titled Some Lamb, and was published in 1975. He encouraged his wife to quit her work as a waitress, cook and theater usher in order to devote herself full-time to her writing, and both eventually encouraged their son, novelist Christopher Rice, to become a published author as well.\n\nRice, his wife and his son moved to Garden District, New Orleans, in 1988, where he eventually opened the Stan Rice Gallery.

His capacity for action is admirable. Very early on he said to me, 'What more could you ask for than life itself'?\"\nPoet Deborah Garrison was Rice's editor at Alfred A. Knopf for his 2002 collection, Red to the Rind, which was dedicated to novelist son Christopher, in whose success as a writer his father greatly rejoiced. Garrison said of Rice: \"Stan really attempted to kind of stare down the world, and I admire that.\"Knopf's Victoria Wilson, who edited Anne's novels and worked with Stan Rice on his 1997 book, Paintings, was particularly impressed by his refusal to sell his artworks, saying, \"The great thing about Stan is that he refused to play the game as a painter, and he refused to play the game as a poet.\"\n\nPersonal life\nRice was an atheist.\n\nDeath\nStan Rice died of brain cancer at age 60, on December 9, 2002, in New Orleans where he lived and was survived by Anne and Christopher, as well as his mother, Margaret; a brother, Larry; and two sisters, Nancy and Cynthia.\nRice is entombed in Metairie Cemetery in New Orleans.\n\nPoetry collections\nSome Lamb (1975)\nWhiteboy (1976) (earned the Edgar Allan Poe Award from the Academy of American Poets)\nBody of Work (1983)\nSinging Yet: New and Selected Poems (1992)\nFear Itself (1997)\nThe Radiance of Pigs (1999)\nRed to the Rind (2002)\nFalse Prophet (2003) (Posthumous)\n\nPoetry video recordings\nTwo series of recordings \u2013 one from 1973 at San Francisco State University and the other from 1996 at the poet's New Orleans home by filmmaker Blair Murphy \u2013 capturing Stan Rice reading several of his poems are on the YouTube site dedicated to the poet.\n\nOther books\nPaintings (1997)\n\nFootnotes\nNotes\nPassage 7:\nStan Marks\nStan Marks is an Australian writer and journalist.

In the first innings of his first match, against Lancashire at The Oval, he took five wickets for 81 runs.In his first full season, 1948, he was Surrey's leading wicket-taker and in the last home game of the season he was awarded his county cap \u2013 he celebrated by taking eight Northamptonshire wickets for 46 runs at The Oval, six of them coming in the space of 6.3 overs for seven runs. This would remain the best bowling performance of his first-class career, not surpassed, but he did equal it seven years later. In the following game, the last away match of the season, he took 10 Hampshire wickets for 150 runs in the match at Bournemouth. In the 1948 season as a whole, he took 91 wickets at an average of 28.07. As a tail-end left-handed batsman, he managed just 93 runs in the season at an average of 4.22.The emergence of Tony Lock as a slow left-arm bowler in 1949 brought a stuttering end of McMahon's Surrey career. Though he played in 12 first-class matches in the 1949 season, McMahon took only 19 wickets; a similar number of matches in 1950 brought 34 wickets. In 1951, he played just seven times and in 1952 only three times. In 1953, Lock split the first finger of his left hand, and played in only 11 of Surrey's County Championship matches; McMahon played as his deputy in 14 Championship matches, though a measure of their comparative merits was that Lock's 11 games produced 67 wickets at 12.38 runs apiece, while McMahon's 14 games brought him 45 wickets at the, for him, low average of 21.53. At the end of the 1953 season, McMahon was allowed to leave Surrey to join Somerset, then languishing at the foot of the County Championship and recruiting widely from other counties and other countries.\n\nSomerset cricketer\nSomerset's slow bowling in 1954 was in the hands of leg-spinner Johnny Lawrence, with support from the off-spin of Jim Hilton while promising off-spinner Brian Langford was on national service. McMahon filled a vacancy for a left-arm orthodox spinner that had been there since the retirement of Horace Hazell at the end of the 1952 season; Hazell's apparent successor, Roy Smith, had failed to realise his promise as a bowler in 1953, though his batting had advanced significantly.\nMcMahon instantly became a first-team regular and played in almost every match during his four years with the county, not missing a single Championship game until he was controversially dropped from the side in August 1957, after which he did not play in the Championship again.In the 1954 season, McMahon, alongside fellow newcomer Hilton, was something of a disappointment, according to Wisden: \"The new spin bowlers, McMahon and Hilton, did not attain to the best standards of their craft in a wet summer, yet, like the rest of the attack, they would have fared better with reasonable support in the field and from their own batsmen,\" it said. McMahon took 85 wickets at an average of 27.47 (Hilton took only 42 at a higher average). His best match was against Essex at Weston-super-Mare where he took six for 96 in the first innings and five for 45 in the second to finish with match figures of 11 for 141, which were the best of his career. He was awarded his county cap in the 1954 season, but Somerset remained at the bottom of the table.\nThe figures for the 1955 were similar: McMahon this time took 75 wickets at 28.77 apiece. There was a small improvement in his batting and the arrival of Bryan Lobb elevated McMahon to No 10 in the batting order for most of the season, and he responded with 262 runs and an average of 9.03. This included his highest-ever score, 24, made in the match against Sussex at Frome. A week later in Somerset's next match, he equalled his best-ever bowling performance, taking eight Kent wickets for 46 runs in the first innings of a match at Yeovil through what Wisden called \"clever variation of flight and spin\". These matches brought two victories for Somerset, but there were only two others in the 1955 season and the side finished at the bottom of the Championship for the fourth season running.At the end of the 1955 season, Lawrence retired and McMahon became Somerset's senior spin bowler for the 1956 season, with Langford returning from National Service as the main support. McMahon responded with his most successful season so far, taking 103 wickets at an average of 25.57, the only season in his career in which he exceeded 100 wickets. The bowling average improved still further in 1957 to 23.10 when McMahon took 86 wickets. But his season came to an abrupt end in mid-August 1957 when, after 108 consecutive Championship matches, he was dropped from the first team during the Weston-super-Mare festival. Though he played some games for the second eleven later in August, he regained his place in the first team for only a single end-of-season friendly match, and he was told that his services were not required for the future, a decision, said Wisden, that \"proved highly controversial\".\n\nSacked by Somerset\nThe reason behind McMahon's sacking did not become public knowledge for many years. In its obituary of him in 2002, McMahon was described by Wisden as \"a man who embraced the antipodean virtues of candour and conviviality\". It went on: \"Legend tells of a night at the Flying Horse Inn in Nottingham when he beheaded the gladioli with an ornamental sword, crying: 'When Mac drinks, everybody drinks!'\" The obituary recounts a further escapade in second eleven match at Midsomer Norton where a curfew imposed on the team was circumvented by \"a POW-type loop\" organised by McMahon, \"with his team-mates escaping through a ground-storey window and then presenting themselves again\". As the only Somerset second eleven match that McMahon played in at Midsomer Norton was right at the end of the 1957 season, this may have been the final straw. But in any case there had been \"an embarrassing episode at Swansea's Grand Hotel\" earlier in the season, also involving Jim Hilton, who was also dismissed at the end of the season. Team-mates and club members petitioned for McMahon to be reinstated, but the county club was not to be moved.\nAfter a period in Lancashire League cricket with Milnrow Cricket Club, McMahon moved back to London where he did office work, later contributing some articles to cricket magazines.\n\n\n== Notes and references ==\nPassage 9:\nHenry Moore (cricketer)\nHenry Walter Moore (1849 \u2013 20 August 1916) was an English-born first-class cricketer who spent most of his life in New Zealand.\n\nLife and family\nHenry Moore was born in Cranbrook, Kent, in 1849. He was the son of the Reverend Edward Moore and Lady Harriet Janet Sarah Montagu-Scott, who was one of the daughters of the 4th Duke of Buccleuch. One of his brothers, Arthur, became an admiral and was knighted. Their great \ngrandfather was John Moore, Archbishop of Canterbury from 1783 to 1805. One of their sisters was a maid of honour to Queen Victoria.Moore went to New Zealand in the 1870s and lived in Geraldine and Christchurch. He married Henrietta Lysaght of H\u0101wera in November 1879, and they had one son. In May 1884 she died a few days after giving birth to a daughter, who also died.In 1886 Moore became a Justice of the Peace in Geraldine. In 1897 he married Alice Fish of Geraldine. They moved to England four years before his death in 1916.\n\nCricket career\nMoore was a right-handed middle-order batsman. In consecutive seasons, 1876\u201377 and 1877\u201378, playing for Canterbury, he made the highest score in the short New Zealand first-class season: 76 and 75 respectively. His 76 came in his first match for Canterbury, against Otago. He went to the wicket early on the first day with the score at 7 for 2 and put on 99 for the third wicket with Charles Corfe before he was out with the score at 106 for 3 after a \"very fine exhibition of free hitting, combined with good defence\". Canterbury were all out for 133, but went on to win the match. His 75 came in the next season's match against Otago, when he took the score from 22 for 2 to 136 for 6. The New Zealand cricket historian Tom Reese said, \"Right from the beginning he smote the bowling hip and thigh, going out of his ground to indulge in some forceful driving.\" Canterbury won again.Moore led the batting averages in the Canterbury Cricket Association in 1877\u201378 with 379 runs at an average of 34.4. Also in 1877\u201378, he was a member of the Canterbury team that inflicted the only defeat on the touring Australians. In 1896\u201397, at the age of 47, he top-scored in each innings for a South Canterbury XVIII against the touring Queensland cricket team.\nPassage 10:\nHartley Lobban\nHartley W Lobban (9 May 1926 \u2013 15 October 2004) was a Jamaican-born first-class cricketer who played 17 matches for Worcestershire in the early 1950s.\n\nLife and career\nLobban played little cricket in Jamaica. He went to England at the end of World War II as a member of the Royal Air Force, and settled in Kidderminster in Worcestershire in 1947, where he worked as a civilian lorry driver for the RAF. He began playing for Kidderminster Cricket Club in the Birmingham League, and at the start of the 1952 season, opening the bowling for the club's senior team, he had figures of 7 for 9 and 7 for 37.Worcestershire invited him to play for them, and he made his first-class debut against Sussex in July 1952. He took five wickets in the match (his maiden victim being Ken Suttle) and then held on for 4 not out with Peter Richardson (20 not out) to add the 12 runs needed for a one-wicket victory after his county had collapsed from 192 for 2 to 238 for 9. A week later he claimed four wickets against Warwickshire, then a few days later still he managed 6 for 52 (five of his victims bowled) in what was otherwise a disastrous innings defeat to Derbyshire. In the last match of the season he took a career-best 6 for 51 against Glamorgan; he and Reg Perks (4 for 59) bowled unchanged throughout the first innings. Worcestershire won the game and Lobban finished the season with 23 wickets at 23.69.He took 23 wickets again in 1953, but at a considerably worse average of 34.43, and had only two really successful games: against Oxford University in June, when he took 5 for 70, and then against Sussex in July. On this occasion Lobban claimed eight wickets, his most in a match, including 6 for 103 in the first innings. He also made his highest score with the bat, 18, but Sussex won by five wickets.In 1954 Lobban made only two first-class appearances, and managed only the single wicket of Gloucestershire tail-ender Bomber Wells. In his final game, against Warwickshire at Dudley, his nine first-innings overs cost 51. He bowled just two overs in the second innings as Warwickshire completed an easy ten-wicket win. Lobban played one more Second XI game, against Glamorgan II at Cardiff Arms Park; in this he picked up five wickets.\nHe was also a professional boxer and played rugby union for Kidderminster.He later moved to Canada, where he worked as a teacher in Burnaby, British Columbia.

In the first innings of his first match, against Lancashire at The Oval, he took five wickets for 81 runs.In his first full season, 1948, he was Surrey's leading wicket-taker and in the last home game of the season he was awarded his county cap \u2013 he celebrated by taking eight Northamptonshire wickets for 46 runs at The Oval, six of them coming in the space of 6.3 overs for seven runs. This would remain the best bowling performance of his first-class career, not surpassed, but he did equal it seven years later. In the following game, the last away match of the season, he took 10 Hampshire wickets for 150 runs in the match at Bournemouth. In the 1948 season as a whole, he took 91 wickets at an average of 28.07. As a tail-end left-handed batsman, he managed just 93 runs in the season at an average of 4.22.The emergence of Tony Lock as a slow left-arm bowler in 1949 brought a stuttering end of McMahon's Surrey career. Though he played in 12 first-class matches in the 1949 season, McMahon took only 19 wickets; a similar number of matches in 1950 brought 34 wickets. In 1951, he played just seven times and in 1952 only three times. In 1953, Lock split the first finger of his left hand, and played in only 11 of Surrey's County Championship matches; McMahon played as his deputy in 14 Championship matches, though a measure of their comparative merits was that Lock's 11 games produced 67 wickets at 12.38 runs apiece, while McMahon's 14 games brought him 45 wickets at the, for him, low average of 21.53. At the end of the 1953 season, McMahon was allowed to leave Surrey to join Somerset, then languishing at the foot of the County Championship and recruiting widely from other counties and other countries.\n\nSomerset cricketer\nSomerset's slow bowling in 1954 was in the hands of leg-spinner Johnny Lawrence, with support from the off-spin of Jim Hilton while promising off-spinner Brian Langford was on national service. McMahon filled a vacancy for a left-arm orthodox spinner that had been there since the retirement of Horace Hazell at the end of the 1952 season; Hazell's apparent successor, Roy Smith, had failed to realise his promise as a bowler in 1953, though his batting had advanced significantly.\nMcMahon instantly became a first-team regular and played in almost every match during his four years with the county, not missing a single Championship game until he was controversially dropped from the side in August 1957, after which he did not play in the Championship again.In the 1954 season, McMahon, alongside fellow newcomer Hilton, was something of a disappointment, according to Wisden: \"The new spin bowlers, McMahon and Hilton, did not attain to the best standards of their craft in a wet summer, yet, like the rest of the attack, they would have fared better with reasonable support in the field and from their own batsmen,\" it said. McMahon took 85 wickets at an average of 27.47 (Hilton took only 42 at a higher average). His best match was against Essex at Weston-super-Mare where he took six for 96 in the first innings and five for 45 in the second to finish with match figures of 11 for 141, which were the best of his career. He was awarded his county cap in the 1954 season, but Somerset remained at the bottom of the table.\nThe figures for the 1955 were similar: McMahon this time took 75 wickets at 28.77 apiece. There was a small improvement in his batting and the arrival of Bryan Lobb elevated McMahon to No 10 in the batting order for most of the season, and he responded with 262 runs and an average of 9.03. This included his highest-ever score, 24, made in the match against Sussex at Frome. A week later in Somerset's next match, he equalled his best-ever bowling performance, taking eight Kent wickets for 46 runs in the first innings of a match at Yeovil through what Wisden called \"clever variation of flight and spin\". These matches brought two victories for Somerset, but there were only two others in the 1955 season and the side finished at the bottom of the Championship for the fourth season running.At the end of the 1955 season, Lawrence retired and McMahon became Somerset's senior spin bowler for the 1956 season, with Langford returning from National Service as the main support. McMahon responded with his most successful season so far, taking 103 wickets at an average of 25.57, the only season in his career in which he exceeded 100 wickets. The bowling average improved still further in 1957 to 23.10 when McMahon took 86 wickets. But his season came to an abrupt end in mid-August 1957 when, after 108 consecutive Championship matches, he was dropped from the first team during the Weston-super-Mare festival. Though he played some games for the second eleven later in August, he regained his place in the first team for only a single end-of-season friendly match, and he was told that his services were not required for the future, a decision, said Wisden, that \"proved highly controversial\".\n\nSacked by Somerset\nThe reason behind McMahon's sacking did not become public knowledge for many years. In its obituary of him in 2002, McMahon was described by Wisden as \"a man who embraced the antipodean virtues of candour and conviviality\". It went on: \"Legend tells of a night at the Flying Horse Inn in Nottingham when he beheaded the gladioli with an ornamental sword, crying: 'When Mac drinks, everybody drinks!'\" The obituary recounts a further escapade in second eleven match at Midsomer Norton where a curfew imposed on the team was circumvented by \"a POW-type loop\" organised by McMahon, \"with his team-mates escaping through a ground-storey window and then presenting themselves again\". As the only Somerset second eleven match that McMahon played in at Midsomer Norton was right at the end of the 1957 season, this may have been the final straw. But in any case there had been \"an embarrassing episode at Swansea's Grand Hotel\" earlier in the season, also involving Jim Hilton, who was also dismissed at the end of the season. Team-mates and club members petitioned for McMahon to be reinstated, but the county club was not to be moved.\nAfter a period in Lancashire League cricket with Milnrow Cricket Club, McMahon moved back to London where he did office work, later contributing some articles to cricket magazines.\n\n\n== Notes and references ==\nPassage 9:\nHenry Moore (cricketer)\nHenry Walter Moore (1849 \u2013 20 August 1916) was an English-born first-class cricketer who spent most of his life in New Zealand.\n\nLife and family\nHenry Moore was born in Cranbrook, Kent, in 1849.

The setting of the story is transplanted from Stockholm to San Francisco. It was directed by Stuart Rosenberg and features Walter Matthau as Detective Jake Martin.\n\nPlot\nA busload of passengers, including off-duty police detective Dave Evans, are gunned down and killed. Evans, on his own time, has been following a man named Gus Niles in search of information linking businessman Henry Camarero to the murder of his wife, Teresa, two years earlier.\nEvans was the partner of Detective Sergeant Jake Martin, a veteran but cynical member of the Homicide Detail working the bus massacre investigation. Jake originally investigated the Teresa Camarero case and has been obsessed with his failure to \"make\" Camarero for the murder. Jake returns to it after many dead-end leads (including a disastrous confrontation with a deranged amputee who takes hostages at gunpoint) in the bus investigation. Niles was killed on the bus as well, and it was Niles who provided the alibi that enabled Camarero to cover up his wife's murder.\nThe sullen Jake and enthusiastic but impulsive Inspector Leo Larsen are paired to interview suspects. Jake shuts out Larsen from his deductions, while Larsen, despite a loose-on-the-rules and brutal side, tries to understand and gain the confidence of his new partner. Defying the orders of their police superior Lt. Steiner, they seek, find and then smoke out Camarero, leading to a chase through the streets of San Francisco and a confrontation aboard another bus.\n\nCast\nWalter Matthau as Sgt.

It provides the special delight we get from gradually unraveling a complicated case... The direction is by Stuart Rosenberg, and marks a comeback of sorts... With The Laughing Policeman, he takes a labyrinthine plot and leads us through it at a gallop; he respects our intelligence and doesn't bother to throw in a lot of scenes where everything is explained. All the pieces in the puzzle do fit together, you realize after the movie is over, and part of the fun is assembling them yourself. And there are a couple of scenes that are really stunning, like the bus shooting, and an emergency room operation, and scenes where the partners try to shake up street people to get a lead out of them. Police movies so often depend on sheer escapist action that it's fun to find a good one.\nVariety praised the film saying that \"After an extremely overdone prolog of violent mass murder on a bus, The Laughing Policeman becomes a handsomely made manhunt actioner, starring Walter Matthau and Bruce Dern in excellent performances as two San Francisco detectives\".According to Chris Petit of Time Out, \"By the end, complete with car chase and split-second shooting, the film has become indistinguishable from all those movies it's trying so hard to disown\".The Laughing Policeman was released on Blu-ray on November 15, 2016. Matthew Hartman of High-Def Digest, who reviewed it, wrote \"[the film] could have been a great and gritty 70s thriller, unfortunately, it's primary story doesn't live up to the potential of the opening scene\".\n\nSee also\nList of American films of 1973\nPassage 4:\nPiero Schivazappa\nPiero Schivazappa (born  14 April 1935) is an Italian film and television director and screenwriter.\n\nLife and career\nBorn in Colorno, Schivazappa entered the film industry in 1959 as an assistant director, collaborating with Valerio Zurlini, Mario Monicelli and  Carlo Lizzani, among others.

The setting of the story is transplanted from Stockholm to San Francisco. It was directed by Stuart Rosenberg and features Walter Matthau as Detective Jake Martin.\n\nPlot\nA busload of passengers, including off-duty police detective Dave Evans, are gunned down and killed. Evans, on his own time, has been following a man named Gus Niles in search of information linking businessman Henry Camarero to the murder of his wife, Teresa, two years earlier.\nEvans was the partner of Detective Sergeant Jake Martin, a veteran but cynical member of the Homicide Detail working the bus massacre investigation. Jake originally investigated the Teresa Camarero case and has been obsessed with his failure to \"make\" Camarero for the murder. Jake returns to it after many dead-end leads (including a disastrous confrontation with a deranged amputee who takes hostages at gunpoint) in the bus investigation. Niles was killed on the bus as well, and it was Niles who provided the alibi that enabled Camarero to cover up his wife's murder.\nThe sullen Jake and enthusiastic but impulsive Inspector Leo Larsen are paired to interview suspects. Jake shuts out Larsen from his deductions, while Larsen, despite a loose-on-the-rules and brutal side, tries to understand and gain the confidence of his new partner. Defying the orders of their police superior Lt. Steiner, they seek, find and then smoke out Camarero, leading to a chase through the streets of San Francisco and a confrontation aboard another bus.\n\nCast\nWalter Matthau as Sgt.

It provides the special delight we get from gradually unraveling a complicated case... The direction is by Stuart Rosenberg, and marks a comeback of sorts... With The Laughing Policeman, he takes a labyrinthine plot and leads us through it at a gallop; he respects our intelligence and doesn't bother to throw in a lot of scenes where everything is explained. All the pieces in the puzzle do fit together, you realize after the movie is over, and part of the fun is assembling them yourself. And there are a couple of scenes that are really stunning, like the bus shooting, and an emergency room operation, and scenes where the partners try to shake up street people to get a lead out of them. Police movies so often depend on sheer escapist action that it's fun to find a good one.\nVariety praised the film saying that \"After an extremely overdone prolog of violent mass murder on a bus, The Laughing Policeman becomes a handsomely made manhunt actioner, starring Walter Matthau and Bruce Dern in excellent performances as two San Francisco detectives\".According to Chris Petit of Time Out, \"By the end, complete with car chase and split-second shooting, the film has become indistinguishable from all those movies it's trying so hard to disown\".The Laughing Policeman was released on Blu-ray on November 15, 2016. Matthew Hartman of High-Def Digest, who reviewed it, wrote \"[the film] could have been a great and gritty 70s thriller, unfortunately, it's primary story doesn't live up to the potential of the opening scene\".\n\nSee also\nList of American films of 1973\nPassage 4:\nPiero Schivazappa\nPiero Schivazappa (born  14 April 1935) is an Italian film and television director and screenwriter.\n\nLife and career\nBorn in Colorno, Schivazappa entered the film industry in 1959 as an assistant director, collaborating with Valerio Zurlini, Mario Monicelli and  Carlo Lizzani, among others.

He was the second son of Cleombrotus I, and grandfather of Areus I, who succeeded him. Although he reigned for more than 60 years, his life is completely unknown, apart from a victory at the Pythian Games in 336 BC. Several theories have been suggested by modern historians to explain such inactivity, but none has gained consensus.\n\nLife and reign\nCleomenes was the second son of king Cleombrotus I (r.\u2009380\u2013371), who belonged to the Agiad dynasty, one of the two royal families of Sparta (the other being the Eurypontids). Cleombrotus died fighting Thebes at the famous Battle of Leuctra in 371. His eldest son Agesipolis II succeeded him, but he died soon after in 370. Cleomenes' reign was instead exceptionally long, lasting 60 years and 10 months according to Diodorus of Sicily, a historian of the 1st century BC. In a second statement, Diodorus nevertheless tells that Cleomenes II reigned 34 years, but he confused him with his namesake Cleomenes I (r.\u2009524\u2013490).\n\nDespite the outstanding length of his reign, very little can be said about Cleomenes. He has been described by modern historians as a \"nonentity\". Perhaps that the apparent weakness of Cleomenes inspired the negative opinion of the hereditary kingship at Sparta expressed by Aristotle in his Politics (written between 336 and 322). However, Cleomenes may have focused on internal politics within Sparta, because military duties were apparently given to the Eurypontid Agesilaus II (r.\u2009400\u2013c.360), Archidamus III (r.\u2009360\u2013338), and Agis III (r.\u2009338\u2013331). As the Spartans notably kept their policies secret from foreign eyes, it would explain the silence of ancient sources on Cleomenes. Another explanation is that his duties were assumed by his elder son Acrotatus, described as a military leader by Diodorus, who mentions him in the aftermath of the Battle of Megalopolis in 331, and again in 315.Cleomenes' only known deed was his chariot race victory at the Pythian Games in Delphi in 336. In the following autumn, he gave the small sum of 510 drachmas for the reconstruction of the Temple of Apollo at Delphi, which had been destroyed by an earthquake in 373. Cleomenes might have made this gift as a pretext to go to Delphi and engage in informal diplomacy with other Greek states, possibly to discuss the consequences of the recent assassination of the Macedonian king Philip II.One short witticism of Cleomenes regarding cockfighting is preserved in the Moralia, written by the philosopher Plutarch in the early 2nd century AD:\nSomebody promised to give to Cleomenes cocks that would die fighting, but he retorted, \"No, don't, but give me those that kill fighting.\"\nAs Acrotatus died before Cleomenes, the latter's grandson Areus I succeeded him while still very young, so Cleomenes' second son Cleonymus acted as regent until Areus' majority. Some modern scholars also give Cleomenes a daughter named Archidamia, who played an important role during Pyrrhus' invasion of the Peloponnese, but the age difference makes it unlikely.\nPassage 7:\nObata Toramori\nObata Toramori (\u5c0f\u7560\u864e\u76db, 1491 \u2013 July 14, 1561) was Japanese samurai warrior of the Sengoku Period. He is known as one of the \"Twenty-Four Generals of Takeda Shingen\" \nHe also recorded as having been wounded 41 times in 36 encounters. \nHe was the father of Obata Masamori.\n\nSee also\nIsao Obata\nPassage 8:\nLars Eliasson\nLars Eliasson  (December 8, 1914 \u2013 June 5, 2002) was a Swedish politician.

Reshammiya plays a singer who falls in love with a bar dancer and the film is centred on how they find true love.

Rajiv then contemplates suicide but the eyes of a ravishing beauty strikes his own eyes. A chase ensues, until another man appears and takes the \"beauty\" in his own hands.

He was the second son of Cleombrotus I, and grandfather of Areus I, who succeeded him. Although he reigned for more than 60 years, his life is completely unknown, apart from a victory at the Pythian Games in 336 BC. Several theories have been suggested by modern historians to explain such inactivity, but none has gained consensus.\n\nLife and reign\nCleomenes was the second son of king Cleombrotus I (r.\u2009380\u2013371), who belonged to the Agiad dynasty, one of the two royal families of Sparta (the other being the Eurypontids). Cleombrotus died fighting Thebes at the famous Battle of Leuctra in 371. His eldest son Agesipolis II succeeded him, but he died soon after in 370. Cleomenes' reign was instead exceptionally long, lasting 60 years and 10 months according to Diodorus of Sicily, a historian of the 1st century BC. In a second statement, Diodorus nevertheless tells that Cleomenes II reigned 34 years, but he confused him with his namesake Cleomenes I (r.\u2009524\u2013490).\n\nDespite the outstanding length of his reign, very little can be said about Cleomenes. He has been described by modern historians as a \"nonentity\". Perhaps that the apparent weakness of Cleomenes inspired the negative opinion of the hereditary kingship at Sparta expressed by Aristotle in his Politics (written between 336 and 322). However, Cleomenes may have focused on internal politics within Sparta, because military duties were apparently given to the Eurypontid Agesilaus II (r.\u2009400\u2013c.360), Archidamus III (r.\u2009360\u2013338), and Agis III (r.\u2009338\u2013331). As the Spartans notably kept their policies secret from foreign eyes, it would explain the silence of ancient sources on Cleomenes. Another explanation is that his duties were assumed by his elder son Acrotatus, described as a military leader by Diodorus, who mentions him in the aftermath of the Battle of Megalopolis in 331, and again in 315.Cleomenes' only known deed was his chariot race victory at the Pythian Games in Delphi in 336. In the following autumn, he gave the small sum of 510 drachmas for the reconstruction of the Temple of Apollo at Delphi, which had been destroyed by an earthquake in 373. Cleomenes might have made this gift as a pretext to go to Delphi and engage in informal diplomacy with other Greek states, possibly to discuss the consequences of the recent assassination of the Macedonian king Philip II.One short witticism of Cleomenes regarding cockfighting is preserved in the Moralia, written by the philosopher Plutarch in the early 2nd century AD:\nSomebody promised to give to Cleomenes cocks that would die fighting, but he retorted, \"No, don't, but give me those that kill fighting.\"\nAs Acrotatus died before Cleomenes, the latter's grandson Areus I succeeded him while still very young, so Cleomenes' second son Cleonymus acted as regent until Areus' majority. Some modern scholars also give Cleomenes a daughter named Archidamia, who played an important role during Pyrrhus' invasion of the Peloponnese, but the age difference makes it unlikely.\nPassage 7:\nObata Toramori\nObata Toramori (\u5c0f\u7560\u864e\u76db, 1491 \u2013 July 14, 1561) was Japanese samurai warrior of the Sengoku Period. He is known as one of the \"Twenty-Four Generals of Takeda Shingen\" \nHe also recorded as having been wounded 41 times in 36 encounters. \nHe was the father of Obata Masamori.\n\nSee also\nIsao Obata\nPassage 8:\nLars Eliasson\nLars Eliasson  (December 8, 1914 \u2013 June 5, 2002) was a Swedish politician.

The name Coca-Cola was also chosen \"because it was euphonious, and on account of my familiarity with such names as 'S.S.S; and 'B.B.B'\" said Robinson himself. He was also responsible for writing the Coca-Cola name in Spencerian script which was popular with bookkeepers of the era and remains one of the most recognized trademarks in the world. \nThe formula was introduced in May 1886 at the Jacobs Pharmacy in Atlanta. It sold 25 US gallons (95 L) the first year. The next year sales increased to 1,049 US gallons (3,970 L). In 1888 Pemberton sold the formula to Asa G. Candler, another Atlanta pharmacist and businessman, for a total investment of $2,300 before Pemberton died. Coca-Cola was granted a charter in 1892 and became the official Georgia Corporation named the Coca-Cola Company with Asa G. Candler, his brother John S. Candler, Frank M. Robinson and two other associates.  Robinson served as treasurer and secretary and changed the Coca-Cola syrup formula so as not to include any faint traces of cocaine by the time of the Pure Food and Drug Act initiated by the Federal Government in 1906. The starting capitalization for the company was at $100,000.Robinson overall was responsible for the early advertising of Coca-Cola before and after Candler bought the name and syrup formula from Pemberton, the first ads appearing in The Atlanta Journal in 1887. While still working with Pemberton, Robinson had the initial ads display short phrases such as \"Coca-Cola! Delicious! Refreshing! Exhilarating! Invigorating! The new and popular soda fountain drink containing the properties of the wonderful Coca plant and the famous Cola nut.\" Marketing for the drink showed the syrup beverage with medicinal properties curing headaches but with a unique taste. The initial ads distributed invited citizens to try \"the new and popular soda fountain drink.\" Hand painted oil cloth signs were put outside stores displaying the Coca-Cola brand name with catchy words such as \"Drink\" in order to inform customers and other people passing by about the new medicinal beverage that was also a soda fountain drink. First year sales showed an average of nine bottles sold per day.Robinson later retired in 1914, but remained one of the company's directors. In The Columbus Enquirer-Sun a newspaper founded in 1874, published an article in 1906 praising Robinson's work with Coca-Cola: \"there is one person to whom particular credit is due for the fact that the Coca-Cola formula remained, in the hands of the Georgians, and the further fact that the drink soon became so popular. He is Mr. Robinson, and the present secretary of the Coca-Cola Company...In developing the drink, Mr. Robinson has also developed. He is said to be one of the best posted experts on advertising in America today, all due to his experience in advertising and pushing Coca-Cola.\"\n\nPersonal life\nOriginally from Maine, as a young man he was in Iowa where he married Laura Clapp. Robinson had a home in Druid Hills, an early suburb of Atlanta.

Makavejev's most internationally successful film was the 1971 political satire W.R.: Mysteries of the Organism, which he both directed and wrote.\n\nCareer\nMakavejev's first three feature films, Man Is Not a Bird (1965, starring actress and icon of the \"Black Wave\" period in film, Milena Dravi\u0107), Love Affair, or the Case of the Missing Switchboard Operator (1967, starring actress and icon of the \"Black Wave\" period in film, Eva Ras) and Innocence Unprotected (1968), all won him international acclaim. The last-mentioned won  the Silver Bear Extraordinary Prize of the Jury at the 18th Berlin International Film Festival. In 1970 he was a member of the jury at the 20th Berlin International Film Festival. In 1991 he was a member of the jury at the 17th Moscow International Film Festival.His 1971 movie W.R.: Mysteries of the Organism (starring Milena Dravi\u0107, Jagoda Kaloper, and Ivica Vidovi\u0107) was banned in Yugoslavia due to its sexual and political content. He described authoritarian figures in the film as people who are not in control of themselves striving to control others. The political scandal surrounding Makavejev's film was symptomatic of an increasingly oppressive political climate in Yugoslavia that effectively ended the director's domestic career and resulted in his leaving Yugoslavia to live and work abroad in Europe and North America. Makavejev's next film, Sweet Movie (1974), was the first feature work that the director produced entirely outside of Yugoslavia (the film was made in Canada). The film's explicit depiction of sex together with its bold treatment of the more taboo dimensions of sexuality reduced the size of its audience (i.e. it was largely confined to the art house context) and also resulted in the film's being censored in several countries. Makavejev said: \"After Sweet Movie it was as if I had burned all my bridges. I just lost the chance to talk to producers.\"\nAfter a seven-year hiatus in feature film production, Makavejev released the comparatively more conventional black comedy entitled Montenegro (1981). The director's next feature film, The Coca-Cola Kid (1985), which was based on short stories by Frank Moorhouse and featured performances by Eric Roberts and Greta Scacchi, is arguably his most accessible picture.\nMakavejev appears as one of the narrators in the 2007 Serbian documentary film Zabranjeni bez zabrane (Banned without being banned), which gives profound insight into the history and the nature of Yugoslav film censorship through its investigation of the country's distinctive political-cultural mechanisms for unofficially banning politically controversial films. The film contains original interviews with key filmmakers from the communist era.He published two books of selected articles: Poljubac za drugaricu parolu (1960) and 24 sli\u010dice u sekundi (1965).\n\nViews\nIn 1993 Makavejev wrote and appeared in a half hour televised Opinions lecture in Britain, produced by Open Media for Channel 4 and subsequently published in The Times. Makavejev speaks of himself as a citizen of the world but \"of the leftovers of Yugoslavia too\". He cites Jacques Tourneur's Hollywood horror classic Cat People as one of the rare films in the history of the cinema that mention Serbs, \"a people from an obscure region who were haunted by evil; when hurt they turn into ferocious cats, like panthers, and killed those whom they thought to be the source of hurt of rejection\". He comments on the division of Bosnia on ethnic lines:\n\n\"Creators of nationalist myths, both Serbs and Croats, came from the same mountainous region that was probably the source of this Hollywood story. Before the armed conflict, these people were whipping up nationalist fever and indoctrination until conflict became inevitable and both nations were trapped in a bloody embrace...How long will it take for an ethnically \"clean\" state for every single person who miraculously stays alive? A state for each family, a state for the father in case he is a Croat, a state for the mother in case she is a Muslim, a state for the daughter in case she is a Yugoslav, a state for the son in case he is a Serb, a specific flag for the dog, a currency for the cat.\"\n\nFilmography\nFeature films\n\nShort films\n\nJatgan mala (1953)\nPe\u010dat (1955)\nAntonijevo razbijeno ogledalo (1957)\nSpomenicima ne treba verovati (1958)\nOsmjeh '61 (1961)\nEci peci pec (1961)\nParada (1962)\nNova doma\u0107a \u017eivotinja (1964)\nPassage 10:\nK.

The film is based on the short stories The Americans, Baby, and The Electrical Experience by Frank Moorhouse, who wrote the screenplay. It was entered into the 1985 Cannes Film Festival.\n\nPlot\nBecker, a hotshot American marketing executive (played by Roberts) from The Coca-Cola Company, visits their Australian operations in Sydney and tries to figure out why a tiny corner of Australia (the fictional town of Anderson Valley) has so far resisted all of Coke's products. He literally bumps into the secretary (played by Scacchi) who is assigned to help him.\nBecker discovers that a local producer of soft drinks run by an old eccentric has been successfully fending off the American brand name products. The executive vows an all out marketing war with the eccentric but eventually comes to reconsider his role as a cog in Coca-Cola's giant corporate machinery. Along the way there are humorous subplots involving the office manager's violent ex-husband, Becker's attempt to find the 'Australian sound', and an odd waiter who is under the mistaken belief that Becker is a secret agent.\n\nCast\nProduction\nDavid Stratton gave a copy of Frank Moorhouse's book The Americans, Baby to Dusan Makavejev when he attended the Sydney Film Festival in 1975 with Sweet Movie.

Makavejev's most internationally successful film was the 1971 political satire W.R.: Mysteries of the Organism, which he both directed and wrote.\n\nCareer\nMakavejev's first three feature films, Man Is Not a Bird (1965, starring actress and icon of the \"Black Wave\" period in film, Milena Dravi\u0107), Love Affair, or the Case of the Missing Switchboard Operator (1967, starring actress and icon of the \"Black Wave\" period in film, Eva Ras) and Innocence Unprotected (1968), all won him international acclaim. The last-mentioned won  the Silver Bear Extraordinary Prize of the Jury at the 18th Berlin International Film Festival. In 1970 he was a member of the jury at the 20th Berlin International Film Festival. In 1991 he was a member of the jury at the 17th Moscow International Film Festival.His 1971 movie W.R.: Mysteries of the Organism (starring Milena Dravi\u0107, Jagoda Kaloper, and Ivica Vidovi\u0107) was banned in Yugoslavia due to its sexual and political content. He described authoritarian figures in the film as people who are not in control of themselves striving to control others. The political scandal surrounding Makavejev's film was symptomatic of an increasingly oppressive political climate in Yugoslavia that effectively ended the director's domestic career and resulted in his leaving Yugoslavia to live and work abroad in Europe and North America. Makavejev's next film, Sweet Movie (1974), was the first feature work that the director produced entirely outside of Yugoslavia (the film was made in Canada). The film's explicit depiction of sex together with its bold treatment of the more taboo dimensions of sexuality reduced the size of its audience (i.e. it was largely confined to the art house context) and also resulted in the film's being censored in several countries. Makavejev said: \"After Sweet Movie it was as if I had burned all my bridges. I just lost the chance to talk to producers.\"\nAfter a seven-year hiatus in feature film production, Makavejev released the comparatively more conventional black comedy entitled Montenegro (1981). The director's next feature film, The Coca-Cola Kid (1985), which was based on short stories by Frank Moorhouse and featured performances by Eric Roberts and Greta Scacchi, is arguably his most accessible picture.\nMakavejev appears as one of the narrators in the 2007 Serbian documentary film Zabranjeni bez zabrane (Banned without being banned), which gives profound insight into the history and the nature of Yugoslav film censorship through its investigation of the country's distinctive political-cultural mechanisms for unofficially banning politically controversial films. The film contains original interviews with key filmmakers from the communist era.He published two books of selected articles: Poljubac za drugaricu parolu (1960) and 24 sli\u010dice u sekundi (1965).\n\nViews\nIn 1993 Makavejev wrote and appeared in a half hour televised Opinions lecture in Britain, produced by Open Media for Channel 4 and subsequently published in The Times. Makavejev speaks of himself as a citizen of the world but \"of the leftovers of Yugoslavia too\". He cites Jacques Tourneur's Hollywood horror classic Cat People as one of the rare films in the history of the cinema that mention Serbs, \"a people from an obscure region who were haunted by evil; when hurt they turn into ferocious cats, like panthers, and killed those whom they thought to be the source of hurt of rejection\". He comments on the division of Bosnia on ethnic lines:\n\n\"Creators of nationalist myths, both Serbs and Croats, came from the same mountainous region that was probably the source of this Hollywood story. Before the armed conflict, these people were whipping up nationalist fever and indoctrination until conflict became inevitable and both nations were trapped in a bloody embrace...How long will it take for an ethnically \"clean\" state for every single person who miraculously stays alive? A state for each family, a state for the father in case he is a Croat, a state for the mother in case she is a Muslim, a state for the daughter in case she is a Yugoslav, a state for the son in case he is a Serb, a specific flag for the dog, a currency for the cat.\"\n\nFilmography\nFeature films\n\nShort films\n\nJatgan mala (1953)\nPe\u010dat (1955)\nAntonijevo razbijeno ogledalo (1957)\nSpomenicima ne treba verovati (1958)\nOsmjeh '61 (1961)\nEci peci pec (1961)\nParada (1962)\nNova doma\u0107a \u017eivotinja (1964)\nPassage 10:\nK.

On 20 October 2010 he made his first-team \u2013 and UEFA Champions League \u2013 debut, playing the last 12 minutes of a 0\u20130 home draw against Rubin Kazan, thus becoming the youngest Greek ever to appear in the competition, and the second youngest overall (only behind Celestine Babayaro, being surpassed later by Alen Halilovi\u0107, Youri Tielemans and Rayan Cherki). Four days later he made his league debut, again as a substitute in a 0\u20131 loss at AEK.\nMavrias scored his first professional goal on 18 February 2012, netting his side's last of a 2\u20130 success at Ergotellis; he scored his first European goal on 31 July 2012, again netted the last of a 2\u20130 win at Motherwell in the first leg of the third qualifying round of the Champions League, one minute after coming onto the pitch as a substitute.\n\nSunderland\nOn 22 August 2013, Mavrias joined English Premier League side Sunderland on a four-year contract, for an undisclosed fee, rumoured to be \u00a32-3 million. However, he was left out of the squad to play Southampton due to lack of match fitness.\nMavrias made his debut five days later, coming on as a second-half substitute in a 4\u20132 home success over Milton Keynes Dons, for the campaign's Football League Cup. He scored his first goal on 25 January of the following year, netting the winner against Kidderminster Harriers in the fourth round of the FA Cup.On 2 February 2015, it was confirmed Mavrias had joined his former club Panathinaikos on loan until the end of the 2014\u201315 season.\nMavrias returned to Sunderland where he has been training and playing for the Black Cats Under-21s \u2013 and is understood to have impressed the club's coaching staff with his attitude and contribution. But Mavrias has not come close to being included in the first-team squad, however is not bitter over seeing his career stall on Wearside. \u201cI took the decision to leave Panathinaikos and go to Sunderland, and I think anyone in my position would take this decision,\u201d he told the Greek press. On 9 January 2016, almost two years after his last match with the first team, Mavrias entered the game in second half as a substitute in a 3\u20131 away loss against Arsenal for FA Cup.\n\nFortuna D\u00fcsseldorf\nHe was loaned to Fortuna D\u00fcsseldorf on 27 January 2016.\nMavrias - who has 18 months remaining on his Sunderland contract - now has a chance to play regular first-team football after joining D\u00fcsseldorf until the end of the campaign, with a view to a permanent switch next summer. On 6 February 2016, he made his debut with a club, in a 0\u20131 home loss against Heidenheim.\nMavrias performance in D\u00fcsseldorf was satisfying, leading the club to set an offer for the Greek international winger. Unfortunately on 24 June 2016, Sunderland reject Fortuna D\u00fcsseldorf's lower bid than the \u00a3400,000 clause to convert the loan into a permanent switch.\n\nKarlsruher SC\nOn 6 September 2016, after three seasons spent playing for Sunderland, only 7 official caps overall collected as a Black Cats man, plus 2 experiences as a loanee (at Fortuna D\u00fcsseldorf and Panathinaikos), he joined 2. Bundesliga side Karlsruher SC for a three-years contract. On 10 September 2016, he made his debut with the club in a 4\u20130 away loss against Union Berlin. Unfortunately, KSC harboured hopes of promotion back to the Bundesliga this summer, after finishing seventh last term had erupted during the year as the club relegated to Germany's third tier.\n\nRijeka\nOn 24 August 2017, Mavrias joined Rijeka in the Croatian First Football League on a one-year contract with a three-year extension option.\n\nHibernian\nMavrias signed with Scottish Premiership club Hibernian in October 2018 on a short-term contract, following a trial period. He made two first-team appearances for Hibernian, but then suffered a hamstring injury and was released at the end of his contract.\n\nOmonia\nOn 29 December 2018, Omonia officially announced the signing of Mavrias on a 2,5 year contract. He made his debut for the team on 13 January 2019, on a match against Apollon Limassol for the Cypriot First Division, replacing Sa\u0161a \u017divec on the 41st minute. On February 10, he scored his first goal on a match against Doxa Katokopias.\n\nApollon Limassol\nOn 11 June 2021, Apollon Limassol announced him, with a contract lasting until 2023.\n\nInternational career\nOn 19 March 2019, Greece head coach Angelos Anastasiadis announced the call up of Mavrias for the match against Liechtenstein and Bosnia and Herzegovina for UEFA Euro 2020. Mavrias's talent is undoubted and has added versatility to his game, demonstrating he is able to operate as a right back if need be.

He is a Fellow at American Academy in Rome.He received a B.A. ('69) and B.Arch. ('72) from Rice University and a MFA in Design from the California Institute of the Arts. \nIn 2002, he founded the Rice School of Architecture in Paris (RSAP), an advanced program of study for Rice graduate architecture students, located in 12th arrondissement in Paris.

At age 16 he was working as a painter for his father, but then established himself as a magician, daredevil, and escapologist, sometimes with the spelling Harry Herd, as \"The world\u2019s youngest Handcuff King,\" an English version of Harry Houdini, although it's uncertain whether he met Houdini or saw him perform.\n\nActing career\nHeard began his film career in 1912 and used the name Harry Lorraine throughout his acting career. It appears to have been strictly a stage name, as he used the surname Heard on his marriage certificate in 1932, and there is no known documentation of a legal name change.Lorraine's first acting role was Little John in Robin Hood Outlawed. The next month, he took the lead role of Lieutenant Rose in Lieutenant Rose and the Train Wreckers. In this movie, typical for the time period, Lorraine's character is traveling on a train which has been directed to a siding by the enemy, and \u2013 all while the smallest slip means certain death \u2013 as the train is hurtling along, he climbs out of the carriage, swings himself between two coaches, and disconnects the couplings, thereby saving the day by sending on the bulk of the train to destruction while his own carriage remains safely on the track.Lorraine did his own stunts in movies, drawing on his natural strength and the physical skills he had developed prior to acting. During a time when it seemed audiences wanted more and every action movie had to outdo previous movies \u2013 and with only visual effects and music \u2013 some were quite challenging and even dangerous. Examples of some of the daredevil stunts Lorraine performed include diving into a pool of sharks (filming on location in Jamaica), being thrown bound hand and foot from Walton Bridge into the river thirty feet below, fighting six men single-handedly and getting thrown down onto a table with such force that it splintered (this was an unrehearsed and unexpected thrill), jumping from an airplane, dangling from the jib of a very tall crane while bound, being dragged by a taxicab, and sundry chase scenes.Lorraine's acting career spanned three decades, and its end probably had as much to do with the near-standstill of the British film industry during World War II as with his advancing age for the types of characters he usually played.\n\nPersonal life\nIn 1932, Lorraine married Gladys Seals in Kingston. His name was recorded as Harry Heard on the marriage certificate. He was forty-five years old and his occupation was listed as film director; she was twenty-four. Gladys used the name Tonie throughout her life. They had two boys, both born in Staines, whose surnames were registered as both Heard and Lorraine, and adopted to use the surname Lorraine.The British film industry was decimated by the effects of World War II, and after the war Lorraine left acting to manage his father\u2019s building business. Known as Lorraine Estates, it was initially involved in repairing bomb damage to property in Battersea and other sites in and around London. Lorraine continued working in the building business almost until his death at age 85 on 27 March 1970, and was recorded as \"film director (retired)\" on his death certificate. Tonie died in 2002, at age 94.\n\nSelected filmography\nNotes\nCopies of some of Lorraine's movies are no longer extant, and there are only brief synopses for some. For others, even story lines and listing of credits are not available.\nDuring Lorraine's career, there was another actor name Harry Lorraine, an American silent film actor who was noted for comedy and romance films, not action films. Their careers largely overlapped, and due to incomplete records and because the English Harry Lorraine spent time and is thought to filmed movies in the United States, their filmographies have not yet been disambiguated with certainty.\n\nAnswer the question based on the given passages.

On 20 October 2010 he made his first-team \u2013 and UEFA Champions League \u2013 debut, playing the last 12 minutes of a 0\u20130 home draw against Rubin Kazan, thus becoming the youngest Greek ever to appear in the competition, and the second youngest overall (only behind Celestine Babayaro, being surpassed later by Alen Halilovi\u0107, Youri Tielemans and Rayan Cherki). Four days later he made his league debut, again as a substitute in a 0\u20131 loss at AEK.\nMavrias scored his first professional goal on 18 February 2012, netting his side's last of a 2\u20130 success at Ergotellis; he scored his first European goal on 31 July 2012, again netted the last of a 2\u20130 win at Motherwell in the first leg of the third qualifying round of the Champions League, one minute after coming onto the pitch as a substitute.\n\nSunderland\nOn 22 August 2013, Mavrias joined English Premier League side Sunderland on a four-year contract, for an undisclosed fee, rumoured to be \u00a32-3 million.

He scored his first goal on 25 January of the following year, netting the winner against Kidderminster Harriers in the fourth round of the FA Cup.On 2 February 2015, it was confirmed Mavrias had joined his former club Panathinaikos on loan until the end of the 2014\u201315 season.\nMavrias returned to Sunderland where he has been training and playing for the Black Cats Under-21s \u2013 and is understood to have impressed the club's coaching staff with his attitude and contribution. But Mavrias has not come close to being included in the first-team squad, however is not bitter over seeing his career stall on Wearside. \u201cI took the decision to leave Panathinaikos and go to Sunderland, and I think anyone in my position would take this decision,\u201d he told the Greek press. On 9 January 2016, almost two years after his last match with the first team, Mavrias entered the game in second half as a substitute in a 3\u20131 away loss against Arsenal for FA Cup.\n\nFortuna D\u00fcsseldorf\nHe was loaned to Fortuna D\u00fcsseldorf on 27 January 2016.\nMavrias - who has 18 months remaining on his Sunderland contract - now has a chance to play regular first-team football after joining D\u00fcsseldorf until the end of the campaign, with a view to a permanent switch next summer. On 6 February 2016, he made his debut with a club, in a 0\u20131 home loss against Heidenheim.\nMavrias performance in D\u00fcsseldorf was satisfying, leading the club to set an offer for the Greek international winger. Unfortunately on 24 June 2016, Sunderland reject Fortuna D\u00fcsseldorf's lower bid than the \u00a3400,000 clause to convert the loan into a permanent switch.\n\nKarlsruher SC\nOn 6 September 2016, after three seasons spent playing for Sunderland, only 7 official caps overall collected as a Black Cats man, plus 2 experiences as a loanee (at Fortuna D\u00fcsseldorf and Panathinaikos), he joined 2. Bundesliga side Karlsruher SC for a three-years contract. On 10 September 2016, he made his debut with the club in a 4\u20130 away loss against Union Berlin.

Mavrias's talent is undoubted and has added versatility to his game, demonstrating he is able to operate as a right back if need be. His form in Cyprus has been patchy which again makes his selection fascinating. Anastasiadis may see him as a \u2018wildcard\u2019 option to throw on off the bench as his speed could add another dimension to a team severely lacking such a trait.

{"prompt": "Answer the question based on the given passages. Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\nWorskla Forest\nThe Worskla Forest (\u043d\u0430 \u0412\u043e\u0440\u0441\u043a\u043b\u0435) is in the Belgorod Oblast of Russia. It is part of the (Sapowednik) Belogorye Nature Reserve.\nIt lies on the high right side of the Worskla river, between the Worskla and the Gotnja rivers. It covers an area of 1,038 hectares (2,560 acres). Geographically the area belongs to the southern part of the forest-steppe zone. The nature reserve is bordered to the north-west by the village of Krasny Kutok, to the southeast by Borisovka, and in the north and the south and west by the Worsklatal. On the left bank of the Vorskla, is the village of Dubino (Landsgemeinde Belenkoje). The territory of the forest itself is part of the rural community Kryukovo.\n\nGeography\nThe western, northwestern and southern edges form the river terraces and slopes of Woskla and Loknjatal Rivers. The highest point in the forest at 217 metres (712 ft) is located in the northeastern part of the forest. The lowest point (137 metres (449 ft)) is located in Worsklatal. Through the forest run numerous small gullies that are called in this region \"Jar\".\nIn the forest there are no springs and watercourses although the forest is quite wet at the beginning of spring, after the snow melts, flowing rivulets at the bottom of canyons. The rivers Vorskla, Gotnja and Loknja flow along the forest edge for a distance of 10 to 900 metres (33 to 2,953 ft).\nOn the territory of the forest there is no natural pond. Only in the protection zone of the nature reserve, in the Worsklatalaue, there are small backwaters. In the 20th century, ponds were built in the Klosterrunse whose dams broke through snow meltwater. Only a pond remained at the top of the gully.\n\nSoils\nThe soils of the forest at the Vorskla developed on different parent materials, especially on the loam, which is found in the eastern half of the forest. In the northwestern part of the forest, old alluvium sands play a role. They are distributed on the river terraces of Gotnja and Loknja. At the southern and south-eastern edge of the forest an oligoz\u00e4nischer sandy loam is common parent rock. In some places in the southern part of the forest, a rust-colored clay comes out. The oligoz\u00e4nische sandy loam and the rust-colored clay are the starting materials of soil formation, where erosion has removed the loess. Under the oligoz\u00e4nischen clay are rocks from the Cretaceous, which do not appear on the surface in the territory of the forest.\nHere 20 different soil types are distinguished. They differ on the degree of podsolisation and the humus content. All floors of the Forest on the Vorskla are based on the Russian soil classification from 1977 about the types of gray forest soils.  According to the USDA soil classification they belong to the Alfi sols, after the German soil classification if they were classified as Luvisols.\n\nHistory\nUntil the 17th century, the Worskla forest was a part of an undivided oak forest that stretched along the high right bank of the Vorskla River. Forest was used as a natural barrier against depredations of the Tartars. Therefore, logging of the woods was strictly forbidden. At the end of the 17th century, however, the Tartar threat had diminished.\n\nIn the Early 18th century the forest was protected from being cut down by regulations of Peter I. In 1701, the deforestation along the rivers was banned, then in 1703, the ban was extended to the small rivers. The edict included a ban on grazing and oaks, pines, maples and elms with trunk thicknesses of more than 54 centimetres (21 in) were excluded from felling.In 1705 the forest was owned by Count Boris Sheremetev who created a conservation area and hunting reserve. In 1714 Count Sheremetev founded a nunnery in Borisovka on the edge of the forest, today it is a nature reserve.\nIn the 1880s and 1890s the first major deforestation in the fourth section of the forest and in the northern part of the tenth section the deforestation continued into the 20th century.After the October Revolution, the forest on the Vorskla was in danger with felling beginning in 1917, with grazing and vegetable gardens being introduced. Larger native animals almost disappeared.\nIt fell to the entomologist Malyshev to begin a movement to save the forest. He knew the forest at the Vorskla from the time before the revolution when as a student he undertook entomological research there. In 1919 he wrote appeals to various authorities. He also appeared in the People's Assembly of the residents of Borisovka and made propaganda work for forest conservation in schools and village libraries. His efforts were successful, and after the establishment of Zoopsychologischen Station (in 1922) the forest was made a nature reserve in 1924.  Malyshev organized the protection of forests. In the nature reserve began scientific research, the nature reserve, the Natural History Museum was founded. In Russian and Germany  scientific journals first article on the forest at the Vorskla were published. However, Malyshev was subject to a political witch-hunt under Joseph Stalin and he was dismissed from his role at the Nature Reserve and in 1934, Malyshev was transported to Leningrad.\nIn 1934 the forest was transferred to control of Leningrad University.

The forest is around Mount Cole, which formed 390 million years ago. The Indigenous Australians, the Beeripmo balug people, called it Bereep-bereep, which means wild. The forest covers an area of 12,150 hectares, including the forest around Mount Lonarch.The forest is on a plateau which is above grassy plains. The plateau is about 760 metres above sea level. High peaks in the forest include Mount Buangor (1,090 metres), Mount Cole (899 metres) and Ben Nevis (877 metres).The main trees in the southern part of the forest are Messmate (Eucalyptus obliqua), Manna Gum (Eucalyptus viminalis), and Blue Gums (Eucalyptus globulus). In the north, which is drier, there are Yellow Box (Eucalyptus melliodora), and Red Stringybark (Eucalyptus macrorhyncha). There is also the rare Mount Cole Grevillea, Grevillea montis-cole. On the high peaks there are groups of Snow Gums (Eucalyptus pauciflora).There have been 130 different birds seen in the forest, including the Powerful owl (Ninox strenua). Animals include kangaroos, wallabies, echidna, koalas and possums. In 1954, 160 koalas were set free in the forest to as part of a plan to re-establish the animals in Victorian forests. In the 19th century, deer were introduced and Sambar deer are still living in the wet gullies in the south of the forest.\nActivities in the forest include camping, walking, four wheel driving, horse riding, and bird watching.The purpose of the forest is to supply good quality hardwood logs for sawmills. The management plan for the forest also protects the water catchments of several creeks which supply water to nearby towns.\nOn 24 June 2021, the Andrews State Government, following an extensive review and recommendation, declerated that the Mt Cole State Forest would be added to the National Park register, providing it with additional protections. The proposed Mt Buangor National Park would be staged over the next 8 years in addition to 60,000 hectares of State forests and parks also to be added.\n\nMount Buangor State Park\nAn area of 1,940 hectares, the Mount Buangor State Park, was protected from logging in 1973. This park includes the waterfalls on Middle Creek, and the large rock faces and caves on Cave Hill.\n\nClimate\nAs the ranges face into the prevailing westerly storm track, maximum temperatures are particularly cold for the altitude and latitude. Heavy snowfalls occur regularly throughout the year, and sub-freezing daily maximum temperatures have been recorded well into spring at Lookout Hill (965 metres). Cold weather is present even at the height of summer: on 02 February 2005, the daily maximum temperature did not exceed 4.5 \u00b0C (40.1 \u00b0F) at Lookout Hill. The ranges can be classed as having a cool mediterranean climate. Winters are extraordinarily cloudy, evident from the afternoon relative humidity readings at Lookout Hill.\n\nAnswer the question based on the given passages. Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nQuestion: Which film came out earlier, Olavina Udugore or A Pearl In The Forest?\nAnswer:", "input": "Which film came out earlier, Olavina Udugore or A Pearl In The Forest?", "context": "Passage 1:\nWorskla Forest\nThe Worskla Forest (\u043d\u0430 \u0412\u043e\u0440\u0441\u043a\u043b\u0435) is in the Belgorod Oblast of Russia. It is part of the (Sapowednik) Belogorye Nature Reserve.\nIt lies on the high right side of the Worskla river, between the Worskla and the Gotnja rivers. It covers an area of 1,038 hectares (2,560 acres). Geographically the area belongs to the southern part of the forest-steppe zone. The nature reserve is bordered to the north-west by the village of Krasny Kutok, to the southeast by Borisovka, and in the north and the south and west by the Worsklatal. On the left bank of the Vorskla, is the village of Dubino (Landsgemeinde Belenkoje). The territory of the forest itself is part of the rural community Kryukovo.\n\nGeography\nThe western, northwestern and southern edges form the river terraces and slopes of Woskla and Loknjatal Rivers. The highest point in the forest at 217 metres (712 ft) is located in the northeastern part of the forest. The lowest point (137 metres (449 ft)) is located in Worsklatal. Through the forest run numerous small gullies that are called in this region \"Jar\".\nIn the forest there are no springs and watercourses although the forest is quite wet at the beginning of spring, after the snow melts, flowing rivulets at the bottom of canyons. The rivers Vorskla, Gotnja and Loknja flow along the forest edge for a distance of 10 to 900 metres (33 to 2,953 ft).\nOn the territory of the forest there is no natural pond. Only in the protection zone of the nature reserve, in the Worsklatalaue, there are small backwaters. In the 20th century, ponds were built in the Klosterrunse whose dams broke through snow meltwater. Only a pond remained at the top of the gully.\n\nSoils\nThe soils of the forest at the Vorskla developed on different parent materials, especially on the loam, which is found in the eastern half of the forest. In the northwestern part of the forest, old alluvium sands play a role. They are distributed on the river terraces of Gotnja and Loknja. At the southern and south-eastern edge of the forest an oligoz\u00e4nischer sandy loam is common parent rock. In some places in the southern part of the forest, a rust-colored clay comes out. The oligoz\u00e4nische sandy loam and the rust-colored clay are the starting materials of soil formation, where erosion has removed the loess. Under the oligoz\u00e4nischen clay are rocks from the Cretaceous, which do not appear on the surface in the territory of the forest.\nHere 20 different soil types are distinguished. They differ on the degree of podsolisation and the humus content. All floors of the Forest on the Vorskla are based on the Russian soil classification from 1977 about the types of gray forest soils.  According to the USDA soil classification they belong to the Alfi sols, after the German soil classification if they were classified as Luvisols.\n\nHistory\nUntil the 17th century, the Worskla forest was a part of an undivided oak forest that stretched along the high right bank of the Vorskla River. Forest was used as a natural barrier against depredations of the Tartars. Therefore, logging of the woods was strictly forbidden. At the end of the 17th century, however, the Tartar threat had diminished.\n\nIn the Early 18th century the forest was protected from being cut down by regulations of Peter I. In 1701, the deforestation along the rivers was banned, then in 1703, the ban was extended to the small rivers. The edict included a ban on grazing and oaks, pines, maples and elms with trunk thicknesses of more than 54 centimetres (21 in) were excluded from felling.In 1705 the forest was owned by Count Boris Sheremetev who created a conservation area and hunting reserve. In 1714 Count Sheremetev founded a nunnery in Borisovka on the edge of the forest, today it is a nature reserve.\nIn the 1880s and 1890s the first major deforestation in the fourth section of the forest and in the northern part of the tenth section the deforestation continued into the 20th century.After the October Revolution, the forest on the Vorskla was in danger with felling beginning in 1917, with grazing and vegetable gardens being introduced. Larger native animals almost disappeared.\nIt fell to the entomologist Malyshev to begin a movement to save the forest. He knew the forest at the Vorskla from the time before the revolution when as a student he undertook entomological research there. In 1919 he wrote appeals to various authorities. He also appeared in the People's Assembly of the residents of Borisovka and made propaganda work for forest conservation in schools and village libraries. His efforts were successful, and after the establishment of Zoopsychologischen Station (in 1922) the forest was made a nature reserve in 1924.  Malyshev organized the protection of forests. In the nature reserve began scientific research, the nature reserve, the Natural History Museum was founded. In Russian and Germany  scientific journals first article on the forest at the Vorskla were published. However, Malyshev was subject to a political witch-hunt under Joseph Stalin and he was dismissed from his role at the Nature Reserve and in 1934, Malyshev was transported to Leningrad.\nIn 1934 the forest was transferred to control of Leningrad University. During World War II, the forest fell under German occupation who felled tens of thousands of trees. During the Battle of Kursk, trenches were laid out in the forest, causing soil erosion, which can be seen to this day.In 1994, the Nature Reserve of the University of St. Petersburg was handed over to the Ministry of Natural Resources. Today an area of 160 hectares (400 acres), is the only forest with 300-year-old oak trees to have survived in the European part of the former Soviet Union.\n\nGallery\nPassage 2:\nPearl Airways\nPearl Airways or Pearl Airways Compagne Haitienne was an airline based in Haiti.\nPassage 3:\nOlavina Udugore\nOlavina Udugore is a 1987 Indian Kannada-language film directed, written and co-produced by D.

The forest is around Mount Cole, which formed 390 million years ago. The Indigenous Australians, the Beeripmo balug people, called it Bereep-bereep, which means wild. The forest covers an area of 12,150 hectares, including the forest around Mount Lonarch.The forest is on a plateau which is above grassy plains. The plateau is about 760 metres above sea level. High peaks in the forest include Mount Buangor (1,090 metres), Mount Cole (899 metres) and Ben Nevis (877 metres).The main trees in the southern part of the forest are Messmate (Eucalyptus obliqua), Manna Gum (Eucalyptus viminalis), and Blue Gums (Eucalyptus globulus). In the north, which is drier, there are Yellow Box (Eucalyptus melliodora), and Red Stringybark (Eucalyptus macrorhyncha). There is also the rare Mount Cole Grevillea, Grevillea montis-cole. On the high peaks there are groups of Snow Gums (Eucalyptus pauciflora).There have been 130 different birds seen in the forest, including the Powerful owl (Ninox strenua). Animals include kangaroos, wallabies, echidna, koalas and possums. In 1954, 160 koalas were set free in the forest to as part of a plan to re-establish the animals in Victorian forests. In the 19th century, deer were introduced and Sambar deer are still living in the wet gullies in the south of the forest.\nActivities in the forest include camping, walking, four wheel driving, horse riding, and bird watching.The purpose of the forest is to supply good quality hardwood logs for sawmills. The management plan for the forest also protects the water catchments of several creeks which supply water to nearby towns.\nOn 24 June 2021, the Andrews State Government, following an extensive review and recommendation, declerated that the Mt Cole State Forest would be added to the National Park register, providing it with additional protections. The proposed Mt Buangor National Park would be staged over the next 8 years in addition to 60,000 hectares of State forests and parks also to be added.\n\nMount Buangor State Park\nAn area of 1,940 hectares, the Mount Buangor State Park, was protected from logging in 1973. This park includes the waterfalls on Middle Creek, and the large rock faces and caves on Cave Hill.\n\nClimate\nAs the ranges face into the prevailing westerly storm track, maximum temperatures are particularly cold for the altitude and latitude. Heavy snowfalls occur regularly throughout the year, and sub-freezing daily maximum temperatures have been recorded well into spring at Lookout Hill (965 metres). Cold weather is present even at the height of summer: on 02 February 2005, the daily maximum temperature did not exceed 4.5 \u00b0C (40.1 \u00b0F) at Lookout Hill. The ranges can be classed as having a cool mediterranean climate. Winters are extraordinarily cloudy, evident from the afternoon relative humidity readings at Lookout Hill.", "answers": ["Olavina Udugore"], "length": 3225, "dataset": "2wikimqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "0e1a7715016522e4285d6db621310d72b3db49464271cf47", "pred": " Olavina Udugore (1987) came out earlier than A Pearl In The Forest (2008)."}

It was one of the singles from the soundtrack album for the film Rugrats in Paris: The Movie (known in France as Les Razmokets \u00e0 Paris). With its lyrics written by Farmer and the song being composed and produced by her long-time songwriting collaborator Laurent Boutonnat, \"L'Histoire d'une f\u00e9e, c'est...\" was released on 27 February 2001. The song describes the fairy M\u00e9lusine with \"childish\" lyrics that contrast with double entendres and puns referring to sexual practices. Although the single had no music video nor airplay promotion, it received generally positive reviews from critics and reached top-ten charts in France and Belgium.\n\nBackground and writing\nRugrats in Paris: The Movie was the second in a trilogy of films based on the children's animated television series Rugrats, which features the adventures of a group of toddlers. After filming, the producers wanted to record a soundtrack for the movie with mainly French songs, as well as a few in English. Several singers were contacted, including TLC member Tionne Watkins, the 1990s boys band 2Be3, Sin\u00e9ad O'Connor, Cyndi Lauper and Myl\u00e8ne Farmer. Persistent but unconfirmed rumours claimed that Madonna, as the founder of the Maverick company producing the soundtrack, had expressly asked Farmer to participate in the album. Farmer accepted, but preferred to produce a new song instead of licensing the rights to one of her old compositions. The recording label Maverick signed a contract for an unreleased song, with lyrics written by Farmer and music composed by her songwriting partner Laurent Boutonnat. This was the first time that the singer had recorded a song especially for a movie. An English version was canceled in favour of a French version, and eventually the song only played for about 15 seconds in the movie. The first title chosen, \"Attrapez-moi\", was also quickly abandoned as it was too similar to the Pok\u00e9mon's cry of \"Attrapez-les tous\".\n\nMusic and lyrics\n\"L'Histoire d'une f\u00e9e, c'est...\" is a synthpop song. It tells the story of a mischievous and malicious fairy, M\u00e9lusine, here embodied by Farmer. Lyrically, the song uses words referring to magic, baffling several of Farmer's fans as the lyrics seem to be closer to the themes found in songs by young singers such as Aliz\u00e9e. The lyrics also contain several double entendres and puns which refer to sexual practices. The song's title itself is ambiguous and can be deemed sexually suggestive as it contains a pun in French alluding to spanking: in French, the title \"L'Histoire d'une f\u00e9e, c'est...\" could be phonetically understand as meaning \"L'Histoire d'une fess\u00e9e...\" (translation: \"The Story of a Spanking\").\n\nRelease\nIn Europe the soundtrack release was postponed until 7 February 2001 because Farmer had bought the song's royalties and finally decided to release it as a single, 14 days later. It was only released as a digipack CD single, in which the song's lyrics are written inside, and there was no promotional format. For the second time in the singer's career \u2013 after the song \"XXL\" \u2013 the single cover does not show her, but a drawing of a fairy from the film by Tom Madrid. The song began circulating online a month before the soundtrack's release and was well received by many fans who felt that it could be a hit. The song did not receive much radio airplay, with only Europe 2 playing it regularly. \"L'Histoire d'une f\u00e9e, c'est...\" was also released on the soundtrack of the film in a longer version than the CD single version, and was later included on Myl\u00e8ne Farmer's greatest hits album Les Mots. It was also released as the third track on the European CD maxi \"Les Mots\", released in the Switzerland on 4 September 2002.\n\nCritical reception\nThe song was generally well received by critics, who particularly noted the puns. According to author Erwan Chuberre, the lyrics are \"as funny as disillusioned\" and Farmer uses puns that \"highlight her immoderate pleasure for impolite pleasures\", with a music he deemed \"effective\". Author Thierry Desaules said that the song appears to be a childish fairly tale, but is actually structured in a perverse enough way to address the adult public, as the allusions to the spanking can be seen as references to sadomasochism. Journalist Beno\u00eet Cachin wrote that her puns are \"of the funniest\" and that the singer included in the lyrics \"some very personal thoughts\", including sadness; he added that Farmer appears to be \"fun, dynamic and delightfully mischievous\" on this song.\n\nChart performance\nOn 3 March 2001, the single debuted at a peak of number nine on the French SNEP Singles Chart, providing Farmer her 22nd top ten hit. In the following weeks, the song fell steadily and remained in the top 50 for nine weeks and a total of 15 weeks on the chart. This chart performance was surprising given that the song was aired little on radio, the film met a mixed commercial success in France and there was no music video, no promotion on television, and only one format. According to Instant-Mag the beauty of the single's cover undoubtedly helped increase sales. In Belgium, the single started at number 23 on 15 March 2001, climbed to number 11, then peaked at number 10. Thereafter, it dropped and fell off the Ultratop 50 after 13 weeks. On the 2001 Belgian singles year-end chart, \"L'Histoire d'une f\u00e9e, c'est...\" ranked at number 89.\n\nFormats and track listings\nThese are the formats and track listings of single releases of \"L'Histoire d'une f\u00e9e, c'est...\":\n\nCD single \u2013 Digipack\n\nOfficial versions\nCredits and personnel\nThese are the credits and the personnel as they appear on the back of the single:\n\nMyl\u00e8ne Farmer \u2013 lyrics\nLaurent Boutonnat \u2013 music, producer\nJohn Eng \u2013 artistic director\nGena Kornyshev \u2013 stylist\nTom Madrid \u2013 drawings\nRequiem Publishing \u2013 editions\nPolydor \u2013 recording company\nHenry Neu \u2013 design\nBertrand Chatenet \u2013 mixing\n\nCharts\nRelease history\nPassage 7:\nI Can Change (LCD Soundsystem song)\n\"I Can Change\" is a song by American rock band LCD Soundsystem.

It was one of the singles from the soundtrack album for the film Rugrats in Paris: The Movie (known in France as Les Razmokets \u00e0 Paris). With its lyrics written by Farmer and the song being composed and produced by her long-time songwriting collaborator Laurent Boutonnat, \"L'Histoire d'une f\u00e9e, c'est...\" was released on 27 February 2001. The song describes the fairy M\u00e9lusine with \"childish\" lyrics that contrast with double entendres and puns referring to sexual practices. Although the single had no music video nor airplay promotion, it received generally positive reviews from critics and reached top-ten charts in France and Belgium.\n\nBackground and writing\nRugrats in Paris: The Movie was the second in a trilogy of films based on the children's animated television series Rugrats, which features the adventures of a group of toddlers. After filming, the producers wanted to record a soundtrack for the movie with mainly French songs, as well as a few in English. Several singers were contacted, including TLC member Tionne Watkins, the 1990s boys band 2Be3, Sin\u00e9ad O'Connor, Cyndi Lauper and Myl\u00e8ne Farmer. Persistent but unconfirmed rumours claimed that Madonna, as the founder of the Maverick company producing the soundtrack, had expressly asked Farmer to participate in the album. Farmer accepted, but preferred to produce a new song instead of licensing the rights to one of her old compositions. The recording label Maverick signed a contract for an unreleased song, with lyrics written by Farmer and music composed by her songwriting partner Laurent Boutonnat. This was the first time that the singer had recorded a song especially for a movie. An English version was canceled in favour of a French version, and eventually the song only played for about 15 seconds in the movie. The first title chosen, \"Attrapez-moi\", was also quickly abandoned as it was too similar to the Pok\u00e9mon's cry of \"Attrapez-les tous\".\n\nMusic and lyrics\n\"L'Histoire d'une f\u00e9e, c'est...\" is a synthpop song. It tells the story of a mischievous and malicious fairy, M\u00e9lusine, here embodied by Farmer. Lyrically, the song uses words referring to magic, baffling several of Farmer's fans as the lyrics seem to be closer to the themes found in songs by young singers such as Aliz\u00e9e. The lyrics also contain several double entendres and puns which refer to sexual practices. The song's title itself is ambiguous and can be deemed sexually suggestive as it contains a pun in French alluding to spanking: in French, the title \"L'Histoire d'une f\u00e9e, c'est...\" could be phonetically understand as meaning \"L'Histoire d'une fess\u00e9e...\" (translation: \"The Story of a Spanking\").\n\nRelease\nIn Europe the soundtrack release was postponed until 7 February 2001 because Farmer had bought the song's royalties and finally decided to release it as a single, 14 days later. It was only released as a digipack CD single, in which the song's lyrics are written inside, and there was no promotional format. For the second time in the singer's career \u2013 after the song \"XXL\" \u2013 the single cover does not show her, but a drawing of a fairy from the film by Tom Madrid. The song began circulating online a month before the soundtrack's release and was well received by many fans who felt that it could be a hit. The song did not receive much radio airplay, with only Europe 2 playing it regularly. \"L'Histoire d'une f\u00e9e, c'est...\" was also released on the soundtrack of the film in a longer version than the CD single version, and was later included on Myl\u00e8ne Farmer's greatest hits album Les Mots. It was also released as the third track on the European CD maxi \"Les Mots\", released in the Switzerland on 4 September 2002.\n\nCritical reception\nThe song was generally well received by critics, who particularly noted the puns. According to author Erwan Chuberre, the lyrics are \"as funny as disillusioned\" and Farmer uses puns that \"highlight her immoderate pleasure for impolite pleasures\", with a music he deemed \"effective\". Author Thierry Desaules said that the song appears to be a childish fairly tale, but is actually structured in a perverse enough way to address the adult public, as the allusions to the spanking can be seen as references to sadomasochism. Journalist Beno\u00eet Cachin wrote that her puns are \"of the funniest\" and that the singer included in the lyrics \"some very personal thoughts\", including sadness; he added that Farmer appears to be \"fun, dynamic and delightfully mischievous\" on this song.\n\nChart performance\nOn 3 March 2001, the single debuted at a peak of number nine on the French SNEP Singles Chart, providing Farmer her 22nd top ten hit. In the following weeks, the song fell steadily and remained in the top 50 for nine weeks and a total of 15 weeks on the chart. This chart performance was surprising given that the song was aired little on radio, the film met a mixed commercial success in France and there was no music video, no promotion on television, and only one format. According to Instant-Mag the beauty of the single's cover undoubtedly helped increase sales. In Belgium, the single started at number 23 on 15 March 2001, climbed to number 11, then peaked at number 10. Thereafter, it dropped and fell off the Ultratop 50 after 13 weeks. On the 2001 Belgian singles year-end chart, \"L'Histoire d'une f\u00e9e, c'est...\" ranked at number 89.\n\nFormats and track listings\nThese are the formats and track listings of single releases of \"L'Histoire d'une f\u00e9e, c'est...\":\n\nCD single \u2013 Digipack\n\nOfficial versions\nCredits and personnel\nThese are the credits and the personnel as they appear on the back of the single:\n\nMyl\u00e8ne Farmer \u2013 lyrics\nLaurent Boutonnat \u2013 music, producer\nJohn Eng \u2013 artistic director\nGena Kornyshev \u2013 stylist\nTom Madrid \u2013 drawings\nRequiem Publishing \u2013 editions\nPolydor \u2013 recording company\nHenry Neu \u2013 design\nBertrand Chatenet \u2013 mixing\n\nCharts\nRelease history\nPassage 7:\nI Can Change (LCD Soundsystem song)\n\"I Can Change\" is a song by American rock band LCD Soundsystem.

Mathur was the Director of the Indian Intelligence Bureau between September 1975 and February 1980. He was also the Director General of Police in Punjab.\nPassage 2:\nSweepstakes (film)\nSweepstakes is a 1931 American pre-Code comedy film directed by Albert S. Rogell from a screenplay written by Lew Lipton and Ralph Murphy. The film stars Eddie Quillan, James Gleason, Marian Nixon,  Lew Cody, and Paul Hurst, which centers around the travails and romances of jockey Buddy Doyle, known as the \"Whoop-te-doo Kid\" for his trademark yell during races. Produced by the newly formed RKO Path\u00e9 Pictures, this was the first film Charles R. Rogers would produce for the studio, after he replaced William LeBaron as head of production. The film was released on July 10, 1931, through RKO Radio Pictures.\n\nPlot\nBud Doyle is a jockey who has discovered the secret to get his favorite mount, Six-Shooter, to boost his performance. If he simply chants the phrase, \"Whoop-te-doo\", the horse responds with a burst of speed. There is a special bond between the jockey and his mount, but there is increasing tension between Doyle and the horse's owner, Pop Blake (who also raised Doyle), over Doyle's relationship with local singer Babe Ellis. Blake sees Ellis as a distraction prior to the upcoming big race, the Camden Stakes.\nThe owner of the club where Babe sings, Wally Weber, has his eyes on his horse winning the Camden Stakes. When the issues between Pop and Doyle come to a head, Pop tells Doyle that he has to choose: either he stops seeing Babe, or he'll be replaced as Six-Shooter's jockey in the big race. Angry and frustrated, Doyle quits. Weber approaches him to become the jockey for Rose Dawn, Weber's horse, and Doyle agrees, with the precondition that he not ride Royal Dawn in the Camden Stakes, for he wants Six-Shooter to still win the race.  Weber accedes to that one precondition, however, on the day of the race, he makes it clear that Doyle is under contract, and that he will ride Rose Dawn in the race.\nUpset, Doyle has no choice but to ride Rose Dawn.  However, during the race, he manages to chant his signature \"Whoop-te-doo\" to Six-Shooter, causing his old mount to win the race. Furious that his horse lost, Weber goes to the judges, who rule that Doyle threw the race, pulling back on Rose Dawn, to allow Six-Shooter to win, and suspend Doyle from horse-racing.\nDevastated, Doyle wanders from town to town, riding in small local races, until his identity is uncovered, and he is forced to move on.  Soon, he is out of racing all together, and forced to taking one odd-job after another.  Eventually, he ends up south of the border, in Tijuana, Mexico, working as a waiter. Doyle's friend, Sleepy Jones, hears of Doyle's plight. Jones gets the racing commission to lift the ban, by proving Doyle's innocence.  He then, accompanied by Babe, gets a group to buy Six-Shooter from Pop, and they take the horse down to Tijuana, where there is another big race in the near future, the Tijuana Handicap.\nDoyle is reluctant to ride at first, however, he is eventually cajoled into it by Sleepy and Babe, and of course, his bond with Six-Shooter is there.  He rides the horse to victory, re-establishing his credentials as a rider. The film ends by jumping a few years into the future, which shows Doyle and Babe happily married, with a child of their own.\n\nCast\n(Cast list as per AFI database)\nEddie Quillan as Bud Doyle\nLew Cody as Wally Weber\nJames Gleason as Sleepy Jones\nMarian Nixon as Babe Ellis\nKing Baggot as Mike\nPaul Hurst as Cantina Bartender\nClarence Wilson as Mr. Emory\nFrederick Burton as Pop Blake\nBilly Sullivan as Speed Martin\nLillian Leighton as Ma Clancy\nMike Donlin as The Dude\n\nProduction\nCritical response\nMordaunt Hall of The New York Times gave a very non-committal review of this film, with neither much praise or criticism.

He was the director of the Hood Museum of Art from 2005 to 2010, and the National Gallery of Australia (Canberra) from 1997 to 2004.\n\nCareer\nBrian Kennedy currently lives and works in the United States after leaving Australia in 2005 to direct the Hood Museum of Art at Dartmouth College. In October 2010 he became the ninth Director of the Toledo Museum of Art. On 1 July 2019, he succeeded Dan Monroe as the executive director and CEO of the Peabody Essex Museum.\n\nEarly life and career in Ireland\nKennedy was born in Dublin and attended Clonkeen College. He received B.A. (1982), M.A. (1985) and PhD (1989) degrees from University College-Dublin, where he studied both art history and history.\nHe worked in the Irish Department of Education (1982), the European Commission, Brussels (1983), and in Ireland at the Chester Beatty Library (1983\u201385), Government Publications Office (1985\u201386), and Department of Finance (1986\u201389). He married Mary Fiona Carlin in 1988.He was Assistant Director at the National Gallery of Ireland in Dublin from 1989 to 1997. He was Chair of the Irish Association of Art Historians from 1996 to 1997, and of the Council of Australian Art Museum Directors from 2001 to 2003. In September 1997 he became Director of the National Gallery of Australia.\n\nNational Gallery of Australia (NGA)\nKennedy expanded the traveling exhibitions and loans program throughout Australia, arranged for several major shows of Australian art abroad, increased the number of exhibitions at the museum itself and oversaw the development of an extensive multi-media site.  Although he oversaw several years of the museum's highest ever annual visitation, he discontinued the emphasis of his predecessor, Betty Churcher, on showing \"blockbuster\" exhibitions.\nDuring his directorship, the NGA gained government support for improving the building and significant private donations and corporate sponsorship. However, the initial design for the building proved controversial generating a public dispute with the original architect on moral rights grounds.  As a result, the project was not delivered during Dr Kennedy's tenure, with a significantly altered design completed some years later.  Private funding supported two acquisitions of British art, including David Hockney's A Bigger Grand Canyon in 1999, and Lucian Freud's After C\u00e9zanne in 2001. Kennedy built on the established collections at the museum by acquiring the Holmgren-Spertus collection of Indonesian textiles; the Kenneth Tyler collection of editioned prints, screens, multiples and unique proofs; and the Australian Print Workshop Archive. He was also notable for campaigning for the construction of a new \"front\" entrance to the Gallery, facing King Edward Terrace, which was completed in 2010 (see reference to the building project above).\nKennedy's cancellation of the \"Sensation exhibition\" (scheduled at the NGA from 2 June 2000 to 13 August 2000) was controversial, and seen by some as censorship. He claimed that the decision was due to the exhibition being \"too close to the market\" implying that a national cultural institution cannot exhibit the private collection of a speculative art investor. However, there were other exhibitions at the NGA during his tenure, which could have raised similar concerns. The exhibition featured the privately owned Young British Artists works belonging to Charles Saatchi and attracted large attendances in London and Brooklyn. Its most controversial work was Chris Ofili's The Holy Virgin Mary, a painting which used elephant dung and was accused of being blasphemous. The then-mayor of New York, Rudolph Giuliani, campaigned against the exhibition, claiming it was \"Catholic-bashing\" and an \"aggressive, vicious, disgusting attack on religion.\" In November 1999, Kennedy cancelled the exhibition and stated that the events in New York had \"obscured discussion of the artistic merit of the works of art\". He has said that it \"was the toughest decision of my professional life, so far.\"Kennedy was also repeatedly questioned on his management of a range of issues during the Australian Government's Senate Estimates process - particularly on the NGA's occupational health and safety record and concerns about the NGA's twenty-year-old air-conditioning system. The air-conditioning was finally renovated in 2003. Kennedy announced in 2002 that he would not seek extension of his contract beyond 2004, accepting a seven-year term as had his two predecessors.He became a joint Irish-Australian citizen in 2003.\n\nToledo Museum of Art\nThe Toledo Museum of Art is known for its exceptional collections of European and American paintings and sculpture, glass, antiquities, artist books, Japanese prints and netsuke. The museum offers free admission and is recognized for its historical leadership in the field of art education.  During his tenure, Kennedy has focused the museum's art education efforts on visual literacy, which he defines as \"learning to read, understand and write visual language.\"   Initiatives have included baby and toddler tours, specialized training for all staff, docents, volunteers and the launch of a website, www.vislit.org. In November 2014, the museum hosted the International Visual Literacy Association (IVLA) conference, the first Museum to do so. Kennedy has been a frequent speaker on the topic, including 2010 and 2013 TEDx talks on visual and sensory literacy.\nKennedy has expressed an interest in expanding the museum's collection of contemporary art and art by indigenous peoples. Works by Frank Stella, Sean Scully, Jaume Plensa, Ravinder Reddy and Mary Sibande have been acquired.  In addition, the museum has made major acquisitions of Old Master paintings by Frans Hals and Luca Giordano.During his tenure the Toledo Museum of Art has announced the return of several objects from its collection due to claims the objects were stolen and/or illegally exported prior being sold to the museum.  In 2011 a Meissen sweetmeat stand was returned to Germany followed by an Etruscan Kalpis or water jug to Italy (2013), an Indian sculpture of Ganesha (2014) and an astrological compendium to Germany in 2015.\n\nHood Museum of Art\nKennedy became Director of the Hood Museum of Art in July 2005. During his tenure, he implemented a series of large and small-scale exhibitions and oversaw the production of more than 20 publications to bring greater public attention to the museum's remarkable collections of the arts of America, Europe, Africa, Papua New Guinea and the Polar regions. At 70,000 objects, the Hood has one of the largest collections on any American college of university campus. The exhibition, Black Womanhood: Images, Icons, and Ideologies of the African Body, toured several US venues. Kennedy increased campus curricular use of works of art, with thousands of objects pulled from storage for classes annually. Numerous acquisitions were made with the museum's generous endowments, and he curated several exhibitions: including Wenda Gu: Forest of Stone Steles: Retranslation and Rewriting Tang Dynasty Poetry, Sean Scully: The Art of the Stripe, and Frank Stella: Irregular Polygons.\n\nPublications\nKennedy has written or edited a number of books on art, including:\n\nAlfred Chester Beatty and Ireland 1950-1968: A study in cultural politics, Glendale Press (1988), ISBN 978-0-907606-49-9\nDreams and responsibilities: The state and arts in independent Ireland, Arts Council of Ireland (1990), ISBN 978-0-906627-32-7\nJack B Yeats: Jack Butler Yeats, 1871-1957 (Lives of Irish Artists), Unipub (October 1991), ISBN 978-0-948524-24-0\nThe Anatomy Lesson: Art and Medicine (with Davis Coakley), National Gallery of Ireland (January 1992), ISBN 978-0-903162-65-4\nIreland: Art into History (with Raymond Gillespie), Roberts Rinehart Publishers (1994), ISBN 978-1-57098-005-3\nIrish Painting, Roberts Rinehart Publishers (November 1997),  ISBN 978-1-86059-059-7\nSean Scully: The Art of the Stripe, Hood Museum of Art (October 2008), ISBN 978-0-944722-34-3\nFrank Stella: Irregular Polygons, 1965-1966, Hood Museum of Art (October 2010), ISBN 978-0-944722-39-8\n\nHonors and achievements\nKennedy was awarded the Australian Centenary Medal in 2001 for service to Australian Society and its art.

N. Mathur\nS.N. Mathur was the Director of the Indian Intelligence Bureau between September 1975 and February 1980. He was also the Director General of Police in Punjab.\nPassage 2:\nSweepstakes (film)\nSweepstakes is a 1931 American pre-Code comedy film directed by Albert S. Rogell from a screenplay written by Lew Lipton and Ralph Murphy. The film stars Eddie Quillan, James Gleason, Marian Nixon,  Lew Cody, and Paul Hurst, which centers around the travails and romances of jockey Buddy Doyle, known as the \"Whoop-te-doo Kid\" for his trademark yell during races. Produced by the newly formed RKO Path\u00e9 Pictures, this was the first film Charles R. Rogers would produce for the studio, after he replaced William LeBaron as head of production. The film was released on July 10, 1931, through RKO Radio Pictures.\n\nPlot\nBud Doyle is a jockey who has discovered the secret to get his favorite mount, Six-Shooter, to boost his performance. If he simply chants the phrase, \"Whoop-te-doo\", the horse responds with a burst of speed. There is a special bond between the jockey and his mount, but there is increasing tension between Doyle and the horse's owner, Pop Blake (who also raised Doyle), over Doyle's relationship with local singer Babe Ellis. Blake sees Ellis as a distraction prior to the upcoming big race, the Camden Stakes.\nThe owner of the club where Babe sings, Wally Weber, has his eyes on his horse winning the Camden Stakes. When the issues between Pop and Doyle come to a head, Pop tells Doyle that he has to choose: either he stops seeing Babe, or he'll be replaced as Six-Shooter's jockey in the big race. Angry and frustrated, Doyle quits. Weber approaches him to become the jockey for Rose Dawn, Weber's horse, and Doyle agrees, with the precondition that he not ride Royal Dawn in the Camden Stakes, for he wants Six-Shooter to still win the race.  Weber accedes to that one precondition, however, on the day of the race, he makes it clear that Doyle is under contract, and that he will ride Rose Dawn in the race.\nUpset, Doyle has no choice but to ride Rose Dawn.  However, during the race, he manages to chant his signature \"Whoop-te-doo\" to Six-Shooter, causing his old mount to win the race. Furious that his horse lost, Weber goes to the judges, who rule that Doyle threw the race, pulling back on Rose Dawn, to allow Six-Shooter to win, and suspend Doyle from horse-racing.\nDevastated, Doyle wanders from town to town, riding in small local races, until his identity is uncovered, and he is forced to move on.  Soon, he is out of racing all together, and forced to taking one odd-job after another.  Eventually, he ends up south of the border, in Tijuana, Mexico, working as a waiter. Doyle's friend, Sleepy Jones, hears of Doyle's plight. Jones gets the racing commission to lift the ban, by proving Doyle's innocence.  He then, accompanied by Babe, gets a group to buy Six-Shooter from Pop, and they take the horse down to Tijuana, where there is another big race in the near future, the Tijuana Handicap.\nDoyle is reluctant to ride at first, however, he is eventually cajoled into it by Sleepy and Babe, and of course, his bond with Six-Shooter is there.  He rides the horse to victory, re-establishing his credentials as a rider. The film ends by jumping a few years into the future, which shows Doyle and Babe happily married, with a child of their own.\n\nCast\n(Cast list as per AFI database)\nEddie Quillan as Bud Doyle\nLew Cody as Wally Weber\nJames Gleason as Sleepy Jones\nMarian Nixon as Babe Ellis\nKing Baggot as Mike\nPaul Hurst as Cantina Bartender\nClarence Wilson as Mr. Emory\nFrederick Burton as Pop Blake\nBilly Sullivan as Speed Martin\nLillian Leighton as Ma Clancy\nMike Donlin as The Dude\n\nProduction\nCritical response\nMordaunt Hall of The New York Times gave a very non-committal review of this film, with neither much praise or criticism.

He was the director of the Peabody Essex Museum in Salem for 17 months, resigning December 31, 2020. He was the director of the Toledo Museum of Art in Ohio from 2010 to 2019. He was the director of the Hood Museum of Art from 2005 to 2010, and the National Gallery of Australia (Canberra) from 1997 to 2004.\n\nCareer\nBrian Kennedy currently lives and works in the United States after leaving Australia in 2005 to direct the Hood Museum of Art at Dartmouth College. In October 2010 he became the ninth Director of the Toledo Museum of Art. On 1 July 2019, he succeeded Dan Monroe as the executive director and CEO of the Peabody Essex Museum.\n\nEarly life and career in Ireland\nKennedy was born in Dublin and attended Clonkeen College. He received B.A. (1982), M.A. (1985) and PhD (1989) degrees from University College-Dublin, where he studied both art history and history.\nHe worked in the Irish Department of Education (1982), the European Commission, Brussels (1983), and in Ireland at the Chester Beatty Library (1983\u201385), Government Publications Office (1985\u201386), and Department of Finance (1986\u201389). He married Mary Fiona Carlin in 1988.He was Assistant Director at the National Gallery of Ireland in Dublin from 1989 to 1997. He was Chair of the Irish Association of Art Historians from 1996 to 1997, and of the Council of Australian Art Museum Directors from 2001 to 2003. In September 1997 he became Director of the National Gallery of Australia.\n\nNational Gallery of Australia (NGA)\nKennedy expanded the traveling exhibitions and loans program throughout Australia, arranged for several major shows of Australian art abroad, increased the number of exhibitions at the museum itself and oversaw the development of an extensive multi-media site.  Although he oversaw several years of the museum's highest ever annual visitation, he discontinued the emphasis of his predecessor, Betty Churcher, on showing \"blockbuster\" exhibitions.\nDuring his directorship, the NGA gained government support for improving the building and significant private donations and corporate sponsorship. However, the initial design for the building proved controversial generating a public dispute with the original architect on moral rights grounds.  As a result, the project was not delivered during Dr Kennedy's tenure, with a significantly altered design completed some years later.  Private funding supported two acquisitions of British art, including David Hockney's A Bigger Grand Canyon in 1999, and Lucian Freud's After C\u00e9zanne in 2001. Kennedy built on the established collections at the museum by acquiring the Holmgren-Spertus collection of Indonesian textiles; the Kenneth Tyler collection of editioned prints, screens, multiples and unique proofs; and the Australian Print Workshop Archive. He was also notable for campaigning for the construction of a new \"front\" entrance to the Gallery, facing King Edward Terrace, which was completed in 2010 (see reference to the building project above).\nKennedy's cancellation of the \"Sensation exhibition\" (scheduled at the NGA from 2 June 2000 to 13 August 2000) was controversial, and seen by some as censorship. He claimed that the decision was due to the exhibition being \"too close to the market\" implying that a national cultural institution cannot exhibit the private collection of a speculative art investor. However, there were other exhibitions at the NGA during his tenure, which could have raised similar concerns. The exhibition featured the privately owned Young British Artists works belonging to Charles Saatchi and attracted large attendances in London and Brooklyn. Its most controversial work was Chris Ofili's The Holy Virgin Mary, a painting which used elephant dung and was accused of being blasphemous. The then-mayor of New York, Rudolph Giuliani, campaigned against the exhibition, claiming it was \"Catholic-bashing\" and an \"aggressive, vicious, disgusting attack on religion.\" In November 1999, Kennedy cancelled the exhibition and stated that the events in New York had \"obscured discussion of the artistic merit of the works of art\". He has said that it \"was the toughest decision of my professional life, so far.\"Kennedy was also repeatedly questioned on his management of a range of issues during the Australian Government's Senate Estimates process - particularly on the NGA's occupational health and safety record and concerns about the NGA's twenty-year-old air-conditioning system. The air-conditioning was finally renovated in 2003. Kennedy announced in 2002 that he would not seek extension of his contract beyond 2004, accepting a seven-year term as had his two predecessors.He became a joint Irish-Australian citizen in 2003.\n\nToledo Museum of Art\nThe Toledo Museum of Art is known for its exceptional collections of European and American paintings and sculpture, glass, antiquities, artist books, Japanese prints and netsuke. The museum offers free admission and is recognized for its historical leadership in the field of art education.  During his tenure, Kennedy has focused the museum's art education efforts on visual literacy, which he defines as \"learning to read, understand and write visual language.\"   Initiatives have included baby and toddler tours, specialized training for all staff, docents, volunteers and the launch of a website, www.vislit.org. In November 2014, the museum hosted the International Visual Literacy Association (IVLA) conference, the first Museum to do so. Kennedy has been a frequent speaker on the topic, including 2010 and 2013 TEDx talks on visual and sensory literacy.\nKennedy has expressed an interest in expanding the museum's collection of contemporary art and art by indigenous peoples. Works by Frank Stella, Sean Scully, Jaume Plensa, Ravinder Reddy and Mary Sibande have been acquired.  In addition, the museum has made major acquisitions of Old Master paintings by Frans Hals and Luca Giordano.During his tenure the Toledo Museum of Art has announced the return of several objects from its collection due to claims the objects were stolen and/or illegally exported prior being sold to the museum.  In 2011 a Meissen sweetmeat stand was returned to Germany followed by an Etruscan Kalpis or water jug to Italy (2013), an Indian sculpture of Ganesha (2014) and an astrological compendium to Germany in 2015.\n\nHood Museum of Art\nKennedy became Director of the Hood Museum of Art in July 2005. During his tenure, he implemented a series of large and small-scale exhibitions and oversaw the production of more than 20 publications to bring greater public attention to the museum's remarkable collections of the arts of America, Europe, Africa, Papua New Guinea and the Polar regions. At 70,000 objects, the Hood has one of the largest collections on any American college of university campus. The exhibition, Black Womanhood: Images, Icons, and Ideologies of the African Body, toured several US venues. Kennedy increased campus curricular use of works of art, with thousands of objects pulled from storage for classes annually. Numerous acquisitions were made with the museum's generous endowments, and he curated several exhibitions: including Wenda Gu: Forest of Stone Steles: Retranslation and Rewriting Tang Dynasty Poetry, Sean Scully: The Art of the Stripe, and Frank Stella: Irregular Polygons.\n\nPublications\nKennedy has written or edited a number of books on art, including:\n\nAlfred Chester Beatty and Ireland 1950-1968: A study in cultural politics, Glendale Press (1988), ISBN 978-0-907606-49-9\nDreams and responsibilities: The state and arts in independent Ireland, Arts Council of Ireland (1990), ISBN 978-0-906627-32-7\nJack B Yeats: Jack Butler Yeats, 1871-1957 (Lives of Irish Artists), Unipub (October 1991), ISBN 978-0-948524-24-0\nThe Anatomy Lesson: Art and Medicine (with Davis Coakley), National Gallery of Ireland (January 1992), ISBN 978-0-903162-65-4\nIreland: Art into History (with Raymond Gillespie), Roberts Rinehart Publishers (1994), ISBN 978-1-57098-005-3\nIrish Painting, Roberts Rinehart Publishers (November 1997),  ISBN 978-1-86059-059-7\nSean Scully: The Art of the Stripe, Hood Museum of Art (October 2008), ISBN 978-0-944722-34-3\nFrank Stella: Irregular Polygons, 1965-1966, Hood Museum of Art (October 2010), ISBN 978-0-944722-39-8\n\nHonors and achievements\nKennedy was awarded the Australian Centenary Medal in 2001 for service to Australian Society and its art. He is a trustee and treasurer of the Association of Art Museum Directors, a peer reviewer for the American Association of Museums and a member of the International Association of Art Critics. In 2013 he was appointed inaugural eminent professor at the University of Toledo and received an honorary doctorate from Lourdes University. Most recently, Kennedy received the 2014 Northwest Region, Ohio Art Education Association award for distinguished educator for art education.\n\n\n== Notes ==\nPassage 7:\nJesse E.

He was the younger son of Rudolph I and his wife Matilda of Gleiberg, heiress of Giessen.\n\nLife\nRudolph II inherited the County Palatine of T\u00fcbingen when his elder brother Hugo III died in 1216.  From 1224 onwards, he is described as Count Palatine in many imperial documents, while his younger brother William is merely styled as Count.  Rudolph II supported Bebenhausen Abbey, which his parents had founded. \nNext to his father, Rudolph II is the second most mentioned Count Palatine of T\u00fcbingen in imperial documents, mostly in documents by King Henry (VII) of Germany, the son of Emperor Frederick II, who had been elected King of Germany in 1220, at the age of 8.  Frederick II spent much of his time in Italy, leaving his ancestral Swabia in the hands of his son.  Later, in 1232, Henry revolted against his father, and did everything in his power to win the Swabian nobility over to his side.  Rudolph II appears to have been among the noblemen who sided with Henry VII, at least, he is mentioned in 10 different documents of Henry VII and never by Frederick II.  Considering Rudolph's energetic character, one can assume that he intended to use the conflict between Henry VII and Frederick II to expand his own power and aim at an independent position.Swabian noblemen, including Rudolph II and his brother William, Count Hartmann I of W\u00fcrttemberg and a Count of Dillingen, visited Henry VII in Worms on 8 January 1224.  They met Margrave Herman V of Baden was also present, as was Eberhard, S\u00e9n\u00e9chal of Waldburg and councillor and former guardian of Henry VII in Oppenheim on 5 April 1227 and in Hagenau on 1 May.  In the same year, Rudolph met Duke Louis I of Bavaria, who was an imperial vicar and Conrad of Winterstetten, who was imperial cup-bearer and also a councilor of Henry VII.  He met the Lords of Neuffen and the imperial marshal Anselm of Justingen in Ulm on 23 February 1228.  On 31 August 1228, Rudolph II appears, together with Margrave Herman V of Baden, Count Henry of Wirtemberg, a Count of Dillingen, Conrad of Weinsperg and the councillors mentioned above, as witnesses of a deed in which King henry VII confirms the privileges of Adelber Abbey in Esslingen.  Later that year, Rudolph II appeared as a witness in four deed by Duke Louis I of Bavaria and Bishop Ekbert of Bamberg, together with, among others, Margrave Herman V of Baden, Count Ulrich and Eberhard of Helfenstein, Counts Eberhard and Otto of Eberstein, Count Gottfried of Hohenlohe, and two councilors.Rudolph II stood at the head of a delegation of eight Swabian counts, among them Albert IV of Habsburg, Frederick IV of Zollern and a Count of Eberstein, at the Imperial Diet in Worms on 29 April 1231.  On 22 November 1231, Rudolph II and his brother William met Counts Albert of Rottenburg, Ulrich of Hefenstein and Eberhard of Walpurg at Henry VII's castle in Ulm.  On 31 December 1231, Rudolph witnessed a deed benefiting Neresheim Abbey in Wimpfen, together with Duke Conrad I of Teck and Margrave Hermann V of Baden.  The last time Rudolph II witnessed a deed of Henry VII was on 4 June 1233 in Esslingen, again with his brother William.In 1235, Pope Gregory IX called on the princes of the empire to organize a new crusade into the Holy Land, to render assistance to the beleaguered church there.  Rudolph II is the only Swabian nobleman named in this call to arms; whether he actually went to the Holy Land is unknown.  The fact that he is not mentioned in any deed between 1235 and 1243 suggests that he may have been absent for an extended period.  In particular, no mention is made of his position in the struggle between King Conrad IV of Germany and anti-King Henry Raspe IV, which is remarkable, since this struggle took place mainly in Swabia.  However, a deed in favour of Bebenhausen Abbey which the papal legate made at Rudolph II's request in the army camp outside Ulm on 28 January 1247, suggests that he supported Henry Raspe.\n\nFamily\nThe name of Rudolph II's wife has not been preserved.  She was a daughter of a Margrave Henry from the House of Ronsberg and Udilhild of Gammertingen.

He was the younger son of Rudolph I and his wife Matilda of Gleiberg, heiress of Giessen.\n\nLife\nRudolph II inherited the County Palatine of T\u00fcbingen when his elder brother Hugo III died in 1216.  From 1224 onwards, he is described as Count Palatine in many imperial documents, while his younger brother William is merely styled as Count.  Rudolph II supported Bebenhausen Abbey, which his parents had founded. \nNext to his father, Rudolph II is the second most mentioned Count Palatine of T\u00fcbingen in imperial documents, mostly in documents by King Henry (VII) of Germany, the son of Emperor Frederick II, who had been elected King of Germany in 1220, at the age of 8.  Frederick II spent much of his time in Italy, leaving his ancestral Swabia in the hands of his son.  Later, in 1232, Henry revolted against his father, and did everything in his power to win the Swabian nobility over to his side.  Rudolph II appears to have been among the noblemen who sided with Henry VII, at least, he is mentioned in 10 different documents of Henry VII and never by Frederick II.  Considering Rudolph's energetic character, one can assume that he intended to use the conflict between Henry VII and Frederick II to expand his own power and aim at an independent position.Swabian noblemen, including Rudolph II and his brother William, Count Hartmann I of W\u00fcrttemberg and a Count of Dillingen, visited Henry VII in Worms on 8 January 1224.  They met Margrave Herman V of Baden was also present, as was Eberhard, S\u00e9n\u00e9chal of Waldburg and councillor and former guardian of Henry VII in Oppenheim on 5 April 1227 and in Hagenau on 1 May.  In the same year, Rudolph met Duke Louis I of Bavaria, who was an imperial vicar and Conrad of Winterstetten, who was imperial cup-bearer and also a councilor of Henry VII.  He met the Lords of Neuffen and the imperial marshal Anselm of Justingen in Ulm on 23 February 1228.  On 31 August 1228, Rudolph II appears, together with Margrave Herman V of Baden, Count Henry of Wirtemberg, a Count of Dillingen, Conrad of Weinsperg and the councillors mentioned above, as witnesses of a deed in which King henry VII confirms the privileges of Adelber Abbey in Esslingen.  Later that year, Rudolph II appeared as a witness in four deed by Duke Louis I of Bavaria and Bishop Ekbert of Bamberg, together with, among others, Margrave Herman V of Baden, Count Ulrich and Eberhard of Helfenstein, Counts Eberhard and Otto of Eberstein, Count Gottfried of Hohenlohe, and two councilors.Rudolph II stood at the head of a delegation of eight Swabian counts, among them Albert IV of Habsburg, Frederick IV of Zollern and a Count of Eberstein, at the Imperial Diet in Worms on 29 April 1231.  On 22 November 1231, Rudolph II and his brother William met Counts Albert of Rottenburg, Ulrich of Hefenstein and Eberhard of Walpurg at Henry VII's castle in Ulm.  On 31 December 1231, Rudolph witnessed a deed benefiting Neresheim Abbey in Wimpfen, together with Duke Conrad I of Teck and Margrave Hermann V of Baden.  The last time Rudolph II witnessed a deed of Henry VII was on 4 June 1233 in Esslingen, again with his brother William.In 1235, Pope Gregory IX called on the princes of the empire to organize a new crusade into the Holy Land, to render assistance to the beleaguered church there.  Rudolph II is the only Swabian nobleman named in this call to arms; whether he actually went to the Holy Land is unknown.  The fact that he is not mentioned in any deed between 1235 and 1243 suggests that he may have been absent for an extended period.  In particular, no mention is made of his position in the struggle between King Conrad IV of Germany and anti-King Henry Raspe IV, which is remarkable, since this struggle took place mainly in Swabia.  However, a deed in favour of Bebenhausen Abbey which the papal legate made at Rudolph II's request in the army camp outside Ulm on 28 January 1247, suggests that he supported Henry Raspe.\n\nFamily\nThe name of Rudolph II's wife has not been preserved.  She was a daughter of a Margrave Henry from the House of Ronsberg and Udilhild of Gammertingen. They had the following children:\n\nHugo IV, Count Palatine of T\u00fcbingen\nRudolf III of Scheer (d. 12 May 1277), Count of T\u00fcbingen-Herrenberg\nUlrich\nMathilda, married Burchard II, Count of Hohenberg (d. 14 July 1253, struck by lightning).  Their daughter Gertrude Anna (c.\u20091225 \u2013 16 February 1281) married Emperor Rudolf I, the first Emperor from the House of Habsburg.\n\n\n== Footnotes ==", "answers": ["Elisabeth of Meissen"], "length": 2422, "dataset": "2wikimqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "8e74e61b04f497cda285fdb613c9297b39c2f35c78a46bb4", "pred": " Elisabeth of Nuremberg."}

He was an innovative composer of instrumental music as well as songs, and was the composer of the earliest surviving music for the guitar.\n\nBiography\nThe place of his birth is not recorded, but he grew up in Guadalajara, and probably received his musical training there.  He most likely went to Italy in 1529 with Charles V, in the company of the fourth Duke of the Infantado, \u00cd\u00f1igo L\u00f3pez de Mendoza, marqu\u00e9s de Santillana.  When he returned to Spain he became a priest, receiving the post of canon at the cathedral in Seville in 1546, where he remained for the rest of his life.

He was an innovative composer of instrumental music as well as songs, and was the composer of the earliest surviving music for the guitar.\n\nBiography\nThe place of his birth is not recorded, but he grew up in Guadalajara, and probably received his musical training there.  He most likely went to Italy in 1529 with Charles V, in the company of the fourth Duke of the Infantado, \u00cd\u00f1igo L\u00f3pez de Mendoza, marqu\u00e9s de Santillana.  When he returned to Spain he became a priest, receiving the post of canon at the cathedral in Seville in 1546, where he remained for the rest of his life.  While at the cathedral, he directed all of the musical activities; many records remain of his musical activities there, which included hiring instrumentalists, buying and assembling a new organ, and working closely with composer Francisco Guerrero for various festivities.  Mudarra died in Seville, and his sizable fortune was distributed to the poor of the city according to his will.\n\nMudarra wrote numerous pieces for the vihuela and the four-course guitar, all contained in the collection Tres libros de musica en cifras para vihuela (\"Three books of music in numbers for vihuela\"), which he published on December 7, 1546 in Seville.  These three books contain the first music ever published for the four-course guitar, which was then a relatively new instrument. The second book is noteworthy in that it contains eight multi-movement works, all arranged by \"tono\", or mode.\nCompositions represented in this publication include fantasias, variations (including a set on La Folia), tientos, pavanes and galliards, and songs. Modern listeners are probably most familiar with his Fantasia X, which has been a concert and recording mainstay for many years.   The songs are in Latin, Spanish and Italian, and include romances, canciones (songs), villancicos, (popular songs) and sonetos (sonnets).  Another innovation was the use of different signs for different tempos:  slow, medium, and fast.\n\nReferences and further reading\nJohn Griffiths: \"Alonso Mudarra\", Grove Music Online ed. L.

A pioneer of rock and roll, Jones played rhythm guitar in Bo Diddley's band in the late 1950s and early 1960s, becoming one of the first (perhaps the first) female rock guitarists in a highly visible rock band, and was sometimes called the Queen Mother of Guitar.\n\nEarly life\nBorn in Harlem, New York City, in 1940, Jones grew up in the Sugar Hill section, and attended the High School of Performing Arts where she studied tap and ballet dance and trained in opera. Even from a very young age, she found herself completely consumed with music; purchasing her first guitar at the age of 15. She was briefly in a local doo-wop group, the Bop Chords, which disbanded in 1957.  A chance meeting with Bo Diddley, who was impressed to see a girl with a guitar case, led to an invitation to join Diddley's band as a guitarist and singer.  She recorded with him from 1957 to 1961 or 1963, appearing on singles including \"Hey! Bo Diddley\", \"Road Runner\", \"Bo Diddley's A Gunslinger\", and the instrumental \"Aztec\" which she wrote and played all the guitar parts. However, throughout her career, Peggy Jones always strived to be an independent artist and was involved in an R&B band known as the Jewels, among other various names.Throughout her time with Diddley, Jones maintained the separate career she had begun independently as a songwriter, session musician, and bandleader.  She led her own band, the Jewels (also known as the Fabulous Jewels, Lady Bo and the Family Jewels, and various other names, but not to be confused with The Jewels), which became a top R&B band on the New York \u2013 Boston east coast club scene the 1960s and 1970s.  She eventually left Diddley's band to concentrate on the Jewels and other activities.  She was replaced with another female guitarist, Norma-Jean Wofford (\"The Duchess\").Jones played guitar on Les Cooper's 1962 instrumental \"Wiggle Wobble\" and percussion on the 1967 hit \"San Franciscan Nights\" by Eric Burdon and The Animals and other recordings and later backed James Brown and Sam & Dave.  She remained musically active well into the 21st century.\n\nSolo work\nShe left Bo Diddley's band in 1961 to focus on her work with the Jewels. In 1970, she re-joined Bo Diddley\u2019s band, bringing The Jewels with her.\nJones was known for playing the Roland guitar synthesizer, an experimental instrument not typically heard in rhythm and blues music.\n\nRelationships\nJones met Bo Diddley in 1956 backstage after playing with the Bop-Chords in the Apollo Theater in the neighborhood of Harlem. Many assumed that Lady Bo and Bo Diddley were a couple but that was not the case. She was married to the band\u2019s bass player, Wally Malone.Malone lived in the mountains of western Pennsylvania when he first met Jones in a New York club in the 1960s. Later, Jones invited Malone into her band in 1968 and got married. They both moved to San Jose, California where Jones played at a show with Bo Diddley and that was the time she received her nickname, \u201cLady Bo.\u201d In 1962 Jones left Bo Diddley and recruited The Duchess to play for him. In 1979, Malone and Jones moved to Boulder Creek.\n\nDeath\nAt the age of 75, Peggy Jones died on September 16, 2015, leaving behind her husband, Wally Malone. He announced his wife\u2019s death via Facebook, saying, \u201cToday is one of the saddest days of my life. My wife and partner of 47 years has been called up to that great rock & roll band in the heavens to be reunited with Bo Diddley, Jerome Green and Clifton James. The last hour and a quarter I spent by her side and the last thing I said to her was the quote above regarding Diddley and band. The other thing I added at the end of it is that band doesn\u2019t have a bass player and for them to please hold that seat until it is my time to join them. The incredible part of this is immediately after saying this to her there was a quick sound that came from her and right then her heart stopped beating.

A pioneer of rock and roll, Jones played rhythm guitar in Bo Diddley's band in the late 1950s and early 1960s, becoming one of the first (perhaps the first) female rock guitarists in a highly visible rock band, and was sometimes called the Queen Mother of Guitar.\n\nEarly life\nBorn in Harlem, New York City, in 1940, Jones grew up in the Sugar Hill section, and attended the High School of Performing Arts where she studied tap and ballet dance and trained in opera. Even from a very young age, she found herself completely consumed with music; purchasing her first guitar at the age of 15. She was briefly in a local doo-wop group, the Bop Chords, which disbanded in 1957.  A chance meeting with Bo Diddley, who was impressed to see a girl with a guitar case, led to an invitation to join Diddley's band as a guitarist and singer.  She recorded with him from 1957 to 1961 or 1963, appearing on singles including \"Hey! Bo Diddley\", \"Road Runner\", \"Bo Diddley's A Gunslinger\", and the instrumental \"Aztec\" which she wrote and played all the guitar parts. However, throughout her career, Peggy Jones always strived to be an independent artist and was involved in an R&B band known as the Jewels, among other various names.Throughout her time with Diddley, Jones maintained the separate career she had begun independently as a songwriter, session musician, and bandleader.  She led her own band, the Jewels (also known as the Fabulous Jewels, Lady Bo and the Family Jewels, and various other names, but not to be confused with The Jewels), which became a top R&B band on the New York \u2013 Boston east coast club scene the 1960s and 1970s.  She eventually left Diddley's band to concentrate on the Jewels and other activities.  She was replaced with another female guitarist, Norma-Jean Wofford (\"The Duchess\").Jones played guitar on Les Cooper's 1962 instrumental \"Wiggle Wobble\" and percussion on the 1967 hit \"San Franciscan Nights\" by Eric Burdon and The Animals and other recordings and later backed James Brown and Sam & Dave.  She remained musically active well into the 21st century.\n\nSolo work\nShe left Bo Diddley's band in 1961 to focus on her work with the Jewels. In 1970, she re-joined Bo Diddley\u2019s band, bringing The Jewels with her.\nJones was known for playing the Roland guitar synthesizer, an experimental instrument not typically heard in rhythm and blues music.\n\nRelationships\nJones met Bo Diddley in 1956 backstage after playing with the Bop-Chords in the Apollo Theater in the neighborhood of Harlem. Many assumed that Lady Bo and Bo Diddley were a couple but that was not the case. She was married to the band\u2019s bass player, Wally Malone.Malone lived in the mountains of western Pennsylvania when he first met Jones in a New York club in the 1960s. Later, Jones invited Malone into her band in 1968 and got married. They both moved to San Jose, California where Jones played at a show with Bo Diddley and that was the time she received her nickname, \u201cLady Bo.\u201d In 1962 Jones left Bo Diddley and recruited The Duchess to play for him. In 1979, Malone and Jones moved to Boulder Creek.\n\nDeath\nAt the age of 75, Peggy Jones died on September 16, 2015, leaving behind her husband, Wally Malone. He announced his wife\u2019s death via Facebook, saying, \u201cToday is one of the saddest days of my life. My wife and partner of 47 years has been called up to that great rock & roll band in the heavens to be reunited with Bo Diddley, Jerome Green and Clifton James. The last hour and a quarter I spent by her side and the last thing I said to her was the quote above regarding Diddley and band. The other thing I added at the end of it is that band doesn\u2019t have a bass player and for them to please hold that seat until it is my time to join them. The incredible part of this is immediately after saying this to her there was a quick sound that came from her and right then her heart stopped beating.

During the Cold War era the station was the source of Chinese Nationalist propaganda largely aimed at discrediting the People's Republic of China and buttressing the Nationalists' claims to be the sole legitimate government of all of China.\nThe Voice of Free China, for many years, was owned by the Broadcasting Corporation of China. This was a private company under a government contract to provide public radio programming. The BCC still exists today, but in 1998 the Voice of Free China and the government-owned Central Broadcasting System merged.\nWith the easing of cross-strait relations and the liberalization of Taiwan's government, the Voice of Free China changed its name to Radio Taipei International in 1998 and also used the name \"Voice of Asia\" for some broadcasts. In 2003, it became Radio Taiwan International reflecting the defeat of the Kuomintang government in 2000 and the new government's orientation towards Taiwan independence from China.

The Internet police intercepted an email and Jennifer was imprisoned for her faith. As she endured physical and mental torture, she had to decide: does she stand her ground and languish in jail, or does she recant her belief so she can tell her story to the world and be reunited with her family?A world away, Dr. Charles Lee, a Chinese American businessman, wanted to do his part to stop the persecution by attempting to broadcast uncensored information on state controlled television.

It provides port access and railroad interchange services not only to the more than twenty businesses at the park, but also to any business seeking to ship or receive cargo through the McClellan-Kerr Arkansas River Navigation System.\n\nHistory\nPurchase of 151 acres in July 1967 started the planning process for the dock area at the Port.  Four miles of railroad were constructed by July, 1968, the year in which the port began operations.   In 1970, the railroad connected to what were then the Rock Island Railroad and the Missouri Pacific Railroad, and started work on a marshalling yard.  By 1974 the marshalling yard was complete.    In 1977, railroad engine storage and maintenance buildings were completed.\n\nInterchange\nThe line extends from the dock to the interchange point with what is now the Union Pacific (UP) at a junction near Clinton National Airport.  Access to what is now the BNSF is obtained through trackage/haulage rights.\n\nOperations\nThe port railroad operates with two locomotives and five crew members.  It utilizes a tandem unit with an EMD GP15-1 locomotive owned by the port, and one EMD SW1500 locomotive leased from GATX.  The railroad handles over 20,000 cars annually.\nPassage 5:\nJamal Beyg\nJamal Beyg (Persian: \u062c\u0645\u0627\u0644 \u0628\u064a\u06af, also Romanized as Jam\u0101l Beyg) is a village in Dezhkord Rural District, Sedeh District, Eqlid County, Fars Province, Iran.

The southernmost of the two, Great Abington, covers 1,588 acres (6.43 km2) and is bounded to the south by the county border with Essex, to the west by a branch of the Icknield Way (now the A11), and to the east by the parish of Hildersham. Little Abington covers 1,309 acres (5.30 km2), again bordered by the Icknield Way and Hildersham to the west and east, and by the ancient thoroughfare of Wool Street to the north.The village history dates back to the Bronze Age, some 4000 years ago. The Saxons gave the village its name, originally called \"estate named after Abba\", and the village was listed as Abintone in the Domesday Book. The 'Great' and 'Little' prefixes came later: the Latin magna is observed from 1218 and the Modern English great from 1523 while the Latin parva is observed from 1218 and the Middle English littel from 1336.In the decades before the Second World War the Land Settlement Association created a site to the south of Great Abington consisting of over sixty houses and plots of land for unemployed miners mainly from the former shipyards of Tyneside and coalfields of Yorkshire and Durham.The Cambridge to Haverhill railway line that opened in 1865 crossed Great Abington just south of the village, but closed in 1967. The medieval Cambridge to Colchester road that was the main route through the village was by-passed in the 1960s.\n\nChurches\nGreat Abington's parish church has been dedicated to St Mary since at least the 16th century and comprises a chancel, nave with south aisle and porch, and west tower. The majority of the present building dates from the 13th century, possibly earlier, including the two-storey tower with short leaded spire.Little Abington's parish church is also dedicated to St Mary, and has been since at least the 16th century. The present building consists of a chancel, nave with north chapel and south porch, and west tower. The nave is believed to date from around 1100, and the chancel was rebuilt in the 13th century. The three-storey tower is probably 14th century.\nA Protestant chapel was built in Little Abington towards the end of the 19th century. It closed in late 2019 and the land has now been sold. Demolition of the chapel has been confirmed.\n\nVillage life\nThe village has a vibrant community with a primary school, village shop, pub, football and cricket team and a large number of local businesses, most of them at Granta Park including The Welding Institute which started in Abington Hall in 1946. In 2009 Abington cricket club played a friendly against Babraham cricket club to commemorate 150 years of the cricket team.\nThe village also has a village hall, called The Abington Institute, which has a caf\u00e9, a large main hall with video projection and an audio system allowing the showing of films and presentations. It also has a meeting room, another large room overlooking the cricket pitch and two changing rooms with showers. The Institute is used by many local clubs and organisations and also hosts regular lunches for older Abington residents.\nThe remaining public house, The Three Tuns in Great Abington, is a 17th-century building that was possibly open in 1687 and certainly by 1756. Former pubs in Little Abington include The Crown which closed in the late 20th century, and The Bricklayers' Arms, which opened in the mid-19th century and was sold in 1912. The Princess (later Prince) of Wales in Great Abington opened at the end of the 19th century and closed in about 1963. The King's Arms opened on the Stump Cross to Newmarket road (now the A11) just north of Bourn Bridge in the late 17th century, closing in 1850 with the advent of the railway. The antiquary William Cole was born there while his father was publican. The White Hart opened on the same road just south of the bridge in around 1750, but closed by the end of the century.\nPassage 8:\nLittle Rock Creek\nLittle Rock Creek may refer to:\n\nLittle Rock Creek (Los Angeles County, California)\nLittle Rock Creek (Minnesota River), a stream in Minnesota\nLittle Rock Creek (Mississippi River), a stream in Minnesota\nLittle Rock Creek (Red Lake), a stream in Minnesota\nLittle Rock Creek (Montana)\nPassage 9:\nThe Abingtons, Cambridgeshire\nThe Abingtons are a community in South Cambridgeshire consisting of two small villages: Little Abington and Great Abington, about 7 miles (11 km) south east of Cambridge.\n\nHistory\nThough often listed as a single entity, Great and Little Abington have since early medieval times been two parishes divided by the River Granta and remain so.

The southernmost of the two, Great Abington, covers 1,588 acres (6.43 km2) and is bounded to the south by the county border with Essex, to the west by a branch of the Icknield Way (now the A11), and to the east by the parish of Hildersham. Little Abington covers 1,309 acres (5.30 km2), again bordered by the Icknield Way and Hildersham to the west and east, and by the ancient thoroughfare of Wool Street to the north.The village history dates back to the Bronze Age, some 4000 years ago. The Saxons gave the village its name, originally called \"estate named after Abba\", and the village was listed as Abintone in the Domesday Book. The 'Great' and 'Little' prefixes came later: the Latin magna is observed from 1218 and the Modern English great from 1523 while the Latin parva is observed from 1218 and the Middle English littel from 1336.In the decades before the Second World War the Land Settlement Association created a site to the south of Great Abington consisting of over sixty houses and plots of land for unemployed miners mainly from the former shipyards of Tyneside and coalfields of Yorkshire and Durham.The Cambridge to Haverhill railway line that opened in 1865 crossed Great Abington just south of the village, but closed in 1967. The medieval Cambridge to Colchester road that was the main route through the village was by-passed in the 1960s.\n\nChurches\nGreat Abington's parish church has been dedicated to St Mary since at least the 16th century and comprises a chancel, nave with south aisle and porch, and west tower. The majority of the present building dates from the 13th century, possibly earlier, including the two-storey tower with short leaded spire.Little Abington's parish church is also dedicated to St Mary, and has been since at least the 16th century. The present building consists of a chancel, nave with north chapel and south porch, and west tower. The nave is believed to date from around 1100, and the chancel was rebuilt in the 13th century. The three-storey tower is probably 14th century.\nA Protestant chapel was built in Little Abington towards the end of the 19th century. It closed in late 2019 and the land has now been sold. Demolition of the chapel has been confirmed.\n\nVillage life\nThe village has a vibrant community with a primary school, village shop, pub, football and cricket team and a large number of local businesses, most of them at Granta Park including The Welding Institute which started in Abington Hall in 1946. In 2009 Abington cricket club played a friendly against Babraham cricket club to commemorate 150 years of the cricket team.\nThe village also has a village hall, called The Abington Institute, which has a caf\u00e9, a large main hall with video projection and an audio system allowing the showing of films and presentations. It also has a meeting room, another large room overlooking the cricket pitch and two changing rooms with showers. The Institute is used by many local clubs and organisations and also hosts regular lunches for older Abington residents.\nThe remaining public house, The Three Tuns in Great Abington, is a 17th-century building that was possibly open in 1687 and certainly by 1756. Former pubs in Little Abington include The Crown which closed in the late 20th century, and The Bricklayers' Arms, which opened in the mid-19th century and was sold in 1912. The Princess (later Prince) of Wales in Great Abington opened at the end of the 19th century and closed in about 1963. The King's Arms opened on the Stump Cross to Newmarket road (now the A11) just north of Bourn Bridge in the late 17th century, closing in 1850 with the advent of the railway. The antiquary William Cole was born there while his father was publican. The White Hart opened on the same road just south of the bridge in around 1750, but closed by the end of the century.\nPassage 10:\nLittle Rock Village\nLittle Rock Village was a Native American village of the Potawatomi people located on the north bank of the Kankakee River, at a site close to the current boundary between Kankakee and  Will counties of the state of Illinois in the United States.

He appeared on several television programs, including Seinfeld.\n\nEarly life\nSaluga was born on September 16, 1937 in Youngstown, Ohio. When Saluga was 10, his father was killed in an industrial accident at the Republic Steel Mill where he worked and his mother supported the family by working as a bookkeeper. Saluga, known as \"Billy\" to his friends and family, was a high school cheerleader and class clown. After graduation, he served two years in the Navy and then began working as a performer in local theaters.\n\nCareer\nSaluga spent several years performing in Youngstown, Ohio theaters and clubs. He played numerous roles in notable productions, including Guys and Dolls and Inherit the Wind. Saluga became a talent coordinator for the Steve  Allen show in the late 1960s. in 1969, he created the \"Johnson\" character while a member of the comedic troupe Ace Trucking Company.Saluga's shtick as the character \"Johnson\" would be, when someone would refer to him as \"Mr. Johnson\" or by the common generic nickname \"Johnson,\" to exaggeratedly feign offense and list off all permutations of the name Raymond J. Johnson Jr. and nicknames thereof that do not mention the word \"Johnson:\"\n\n\"NOOO!!! You don't have to call me Johnson! My name is Raymond J. Johnson Jr.  Now you can call me Ray, or you can call me J, or you can call me Johnny, or you can call me Sonny, or you can call me Junie, or you can call me Junior; now you can call me Ray J, or you can call me RJ, or you can call me RJJ, or you can call me RJJ Jr. . . but you doesn't hasta call me Johnson!\" \nSaluga would then smugly turn away and begin puffing on his cigar. Saluga's routine \nreceived more widespread attention in the late 1970s after being used in a series of commercials for Miller Lite beer, and subsequently, in the early 1980s for Anheuser-Busch Natural Light beer. Saluga appeared alongside comedian/pitchman Norm Crosby echoing (in a roundabout way) Norm's advice to unknowing customers on how to more easily order the lengthily-named beer: \"Well, y'doesn't hasta call it Anheuser Busch Natural Light Beer, and y'doesn't hasta call it 'Busch Natural.'  Just say 'Natural!'\" Saluga then later launches into the \"You can call me Ray\" routine after Crosby warns not to ask Johnson his name.From 1977 to 1978, Saluga appeared regularly as Raymond J. Johnson Jr. on Redd Foxx's eponymous variety show. Saluga as Johnson also made appearances on This Is Tom Jones, Laugh-In  and The David Steinberg Show. He also made appearances on Chuck Barris' The Gong Show during 1977 and 1978.\nA novelty disco single called \"Dancin' Johnson,\" based around Johnson's schtick, was released in 1978. a 1978 episode of Good Times contained a scene where Keith (while intoxicated) recited \"You can call me Ray, or you can call me J\" which was at the height of its popularity for the saying.\nBob Dylan referenced the \"you may call me\" schtick in his 1979 hit, \"Gotta Serve Somebody,\" when he sings, \"You may call me Terry, you may call me Timmy / You may call me Bobby, you may call me Zimmy / You may call me R.J., you may call me Ray / You may call me anything, but no matter what you say / You\u2019re gonna have to serve somebody.\" The idea for the verse originated from Jerry Wexler, who suggested it during the recording sessions for Slow Train Coming.\nThe character's popularity is referenced in multiple episodes of The Simpsons, with Saluga appearing as himself in the 2002 episode \"The Old Man and the Key\". Saluga also appeared as Johnson in the 2010 King of the Hill episode \"Just Another Manic Kahn-Day\".\n\nDeath and legacy\nSaluga died of cardiopulmonary arrest in Los Angeles on March 28, 2023, at the age of 85. Saluga's nephew, Scott Saluga, told the media that his uncle was living in Burbank, California at the time of his death. Saluga did not have any surviving immediate family members.Saluga told friends he didn't mind being typecast and known to the public as Raymond Johnson. Comedian David Steinberg said that \"Billy was always doing Ray J. He was relentless with it. I would say 'Mr. Johnson' and Billy would be off. He did it everywhere. At parties. His timing and delivery were so funny every time.\"In 2017, Saluga said that people never recognized him outside his character and that it gave him great pleasure hearing people perform his shtick in his presence without knowing who he was.\n\nBibliography\nSaluga, Bill (1982).

He appeared on several television programs, including Seinfeld.\n\nEarly life\nSaluga was born on September 16, 1937 in Youngstown, Ohio. When Saluga was 10, his father was killed in an industrial accident at the Republic Steel Mill where he worked and his mother supported the family by working as a bookkeeper. Saluga, known as \"Billy\" to his friends and family, was a high school cheerleader and class clown. After graduation, he served two years in the Navy and then began working as a performer in local theaters.\n\nCareer\nSaluga spent several years performing in Youngstown, Ohio theaters and clubs. He played numerous roles in notable productions, including Guys and Dolls and Inherit the Wind. Saluga became a talent coordinator for the Steve  Allen show in the late 1960s. in 1969, he created the \"Johnson\" character while a member of the comedic troupe Ace Trucking Company.Saluga's shtick as the character \"Johnson\" would be, when someone would refer to him as \"Mr. Johnson\" or by the common generic nickname \"Johnson,\" to exaggeratedly feign offense and list off all permutations of the name Raymond J. Johnson Jr. and nicknames thereof that do not mention the word \"Johnson:\"\n\n\"NOOO!!! You don't have to call me Johnson! My name is Raymond J. Johnson Jr.  Now you can call me Ray, or you can call me J, or you can call me Johnny, or you can call me Sonny, or you can call me Junie, or you can call me Junior; now you can call me Ray J, or you can call me RJ, or you can call me RJJ, or you can call me RJJ Jr. . . but you doesn't hasta call me Johnson!\" \nSaluga would then smugly turn away and begin puffing on his cigar. Saluga's routine \nreceived more widespread attention in the late 1970s after being used in a series of commercials for Miller Lite beer, and subsequently, in the early 1980s for Anheuser-Busch Natural Light beer. Saluga appeared alongside comedian/pitchman Norm Crosby echoing (in a roundabout way) Norm's advice to unknowing customers on how to more easily order the lengthily-named beer: \"Well, y'doesn't hasta call it Anheuser Busch Natural Light Beer, and y'doesn't hasta call it 'Busch Natural.'  Just say 'Natural!'\" Saluga then later launches into the \"You can call me Ray\" routine after Crosby warns not to ask Johnson his name.From 1977 to 1978, Saluga appeared regularly as Raymond J. Johnson Jr. on Redd Foxx's eponymous variety show. Saluga as Johnson also made appearances on This Is Tom Jones, Laugh-In  and The David Steinberg Show. He also made appearances on Chuck Barris' The Gong Show during 1977 and 1978.\nA novelty disco single called \"Dancin' Johnson,\" based around Johnson's schtick, was released in 1978. a 1978 episode of Good Times contained a scene where Keith (while intoxicated) recited \"You can call me Ray, or you can call me J\" which was at the height of its popularity for the saying.\nBob Dylan referenced the \"you may call me\" schtick in his 1979 hit, \"Gotta Serve Somebody,\" when he sings, \"You may call me Terry, you may call me Timmy / You may call me Bobby, you may call me Zimmy / You may call me R.J., you may call me Ray / You may call me anything, but no matter what you say / You\u2019re gonna have to serve somebody.\" The idea for the verse originated from Jerry Wexler, who suggested it during the recording sessions for Slow Train Coming.\nThe character's popularity is referenced in multiple episodes of The Simpsons, with Saluga appearing as himself in the 2002 episode \"The Old Man and the Key\". Saluga also appeared as Johnson in the 2010 King of the Hill episode \"Just Another Manic Kahn-Day\".\n\nDeath and legacy\nSaluga died of cardiopulmonary arrest in Los Angeles on March 28, 2023, at the age of 85. Saluga's nephew, Scott Saluga, told the media that his uncle was living in Burbank, California at the time of his death. Saluga did not have any surviving immediate family members.Saluga told friends he didn't mind being typecast and known to the public as Raymond Johnson. Comedian David Steinberg said that \"Billy was always doing Ray J. He was relentless with it. I would say 'Mr. Johnson' and Billy would be off. He did it everywhere. At parties. His timing and delivery were so funny every time.\"In 2017, Saluga said that people never recognized him outside his character and that it gave him great pleasure hearing people perform his shtick in his presence without knowing who he was.\n\nBibliography\nSaluga, Bill (1982).

Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\nJean de Limur\nJean de Limur (13 November 1887, Vouh\u00e9, Charente-Maritime \u2013 5 June 1976, Paris) was a French film director, actor and screenwriter. His works include La Gar\u00e7onne (1936) and The Letter (1929). A French army officer and a designer, he first came to the United States with his parents, Count and Countess de Limur in September 1920; their destination was Burlingame, California, where lived Jean's brother Andr\u00e9 (who married Ethel, daughter of William Henry Crocker).\n\nFilmography\nThe Arab (1924) actor\nHuman Desires (1924)\nThe Legion of the Condemned (1928) co-screenplay\nThe Letter (1929) director\nJealousy (1929) director\nMy Childish Father (1930)\nPaprika (1933) director\nL'Auberge du Petit-Dragon (1935)\nLa Gar\u00e7onne (1936) director; with Arletty, Edith Piaf, and Marie Bell\nPassage 2:\nAndr\u00e9a Ferr\u00e9ol\nAndr\u00e9a Ferr\u00e9ol (born Andr\u00e9e Louise Ferr\u00e9ol; January 6, 1947) is a French actress and officer of the Ordre national du M\u00e9rite (2009).\nHer debut was in the 1973 film La Grande bouffe, which made a big scandal at the Cannes Film Festival.She was the last partner of Egyptian actor Omar Sharif.\n\nFilmography\nPassage 3:\nBrian Kennedy (gallery director)\nBrian Patrick Kennedy (born 5 November 1961) is an Irish-born art museum director who has worked in Ireland and Australia, and now lives and works in the United States.  He was the director of the Peabody Essex Museum in Salem for 17 months, resigning December 31, 2020. He was the director of the Toledo Museum of Art in Ohio from 2010 to 2019. He was the director of the Hood Museum of Art from 2005 to 2010, and the National Gallery of Australia (Canberra) from 1997 to 2004.\n\nCareer\nBrian Kennedy currently lives and works in the United States after leaving Australia in 2005 to direct the Hood Museum of Art at Dartmouth College. In October 2010 he became the ninth Director of the Toledo Museum of Art. On 1 July 2019, he succeeded Dan Monroe as the executive director and CEO of the Peabody Essex Museum.\n\nEarly life and career in Ireland\nKennedy was born in Dublin and attended Clonkeen College. He received B.A. (1982), M.A. (1985) and PhD (1989) degrees from University College-Dublin, where he studied both art history and history.\nHe worked in the Irish Department of Education (1982), the European Commission, Brussels (1983), and in Ireland at the Chester Beatty Library (1983\u201385), Government Publications Office (1985\u201386), and Department of Finance (1986\u201389). He married Mary Fiona Carlin in 1988.He was Assistant Director at the National Gallery of Ireland in Dublin from 1989 to 1997. He was Chair of the Irish Association of Art Historians from 1996 to 1997, and of the Council of Australian Art Museum Directors from 2001 to 2003. In September 1997 he became Director of the National Gallery of Australia.\n\nNational Gallery of Australia (NGA)\nKennedy expanded the traveling exhibitions and loans program throughout Australia, arranged for several major shows of Australian art abroad, increased the number of exhibitions at the museum itself and oversaw the development of an extensive multi-media site.  Although he oversaw several years of the museum's highest ever annual visitation, he discontinued the emphasis of his predecessor, Betty Churcher, on showing \"blockbuster\" exhibitions.\nDuring his directorship, the NGA gained government support for improving the building and significant private donations and corporate sponsorship. However, the initial design for the building proved controversial generating a public dispute with the original architect on moral rights grounds.  As a result, the project was not delivered during Dr Kennedy's tenure, with a significantly altered design completed some years later.  Private funding supported two acquisitions of British art, including David Hockney's A Bigger Grand Canyon in 1999, and Lucian Freud's After C\u00e9zanne in 2001. Kennedy built on the established collections at the museum by acquiring the Holmgren-Spertus collection of Indonesian textiles; the Kenneth Tyler collection of editioned prints, screens, multiples and unique proofs; and the Australian Print Workshop Archive. He was also notable for campaigning for the construction of a new \"front\" entrance to the Gallery, facing King Edward Terrace, which was completed in 2010 (see reference to the building project above).\nKennedy's cancellation of the \"Sensation exhibition\" (scheduled at the NGA from 2 June 2000 to 13 August 2000) was controversial, and seen by some as censorship. He claimed that the decision was due to the exhibition being \"too close to the market\" implying that a national cultural institution cannot exhibit the private collection of a speculative art investor. However, there were other exhibitions at the NGA during his tenure, which could have raised similar concerns. The exhibition featured the privately owned Young British Artists works belonging to Charles Saatchi and attracted large attendances in London and Brooklyn. Its most controversial work was Chris Ofili's The Holy Virgin Mary, a painting which used elephant dung and was accused of being blasphemous. The then-mayor of New York, Rudolph Giuliani, campaigned against the exhibition, claiming it was \"Catholic-bashing\" and an \"aggressive, vicious, disgusting attack on religion.\" In November 1999, Kennedy cancelled the exhibition and stated that the events in New York had \"obscured discussion of the artistic merit of the works of art\". He has said that it \"was the toughest decision of my professional life, so far.\"Kennedy was also repeatedly questioned on his management of a range of issues during the Australian Government's Senate Estimates process - particularly on the NGA's occupational health and safety record and concerns about the NGA's twenty-year-old air-conditioning system. The air-conditioning was finally renovated in 2003. Kennedy announced in 2002 that he would not seek extension of his contract beyond 2004, accepting a seven-year term as had his two predecessors.He became a joint Irish-Australian citizen in 2003.\n\nToledo Museum of Art\nThe Toledo Museum of Art is known for its exceptional collections of European and American paintings and sculpture, glass, antiquities, artist books, Japanese prints and netsuke. The museum offers free admission and is recognized for its historical leadership in the field of art education.  During his tenure, Kennedy has focused the museum's art education efforts on visual literacy, which he defines as \"learning to read, understand and write visual language.\"   Initiatives have included baby and toddler tours, specialized training for all staff, docents, volunteers and the launch of a website, www.vislit.org. In November 2014, the museum hosted the International Visual Literacy Association (IVLA) conference, the first Museum to do so. Kennedy has been a frequent speaker on the topic, including 2010 and 2013 TEDx talks on visual and sensory literacy.\nKennedy has expressed an interest in expanding the museum's collection of contemporary art and art by indigenous peoples. Works by Frank Stella, Sean Scully, Jaume Plensa, Ravinder Reddy and Mary Sibande have been acquired.  In addition, the museum has made major acquisitions of Old Master paintings by Frans Hals and Luca Giordano.During his tenure the Toledo Museum of Art has announced the return of several objects from its collection due to claims the objects were stolen and/or illegally exported prior being sold to the museum.  In 2011 a Meissen sweetmeat stand was returned to Germany followed by an Etruscan Kalpis or water jug to Italy (2013), an Indian sculpture of Ganesha (2014) and an astrological compendium to Germany in 2015.\n\nHood Museum of Art\nKennedy became Director of the Hood Museum of Art in July 2005. During his tenure, he implemented a series of large and small-scale exhibitions and oversaw the production of more than 20 publications to bring greater public attention to the museum's remarkable collections of the arts of America, Europe, Africa, Papua New Guinea and the Polar regions. At 70,000 objects, the Hood has one of the largest collections on any American college of university campus. The exhibition, Black Womanhood: Images, Icons, and Ideologies of the African Body, toured several US venues. Kennedy increased campus curricular use of works of art, with thousands of objects pulled from storage for classes annually. Numerous acquisitions were made with the museum's generous endowments, and he curated several exhibitions: including Wenda Gu: Forest of Stone Steles: Retranslation and Rewriting Tang Dynasty Poetry, Sean Scully: The Art of the Stripe, and Frank Stella: Irregular Polygons.\n\nPublications\nKennedy has written or edited a number of books on art, including:\n\nAlfred Chester Beatty and Ireland 1950-1968: A study in cultural politics, Glendale Press (1988), ISBN 978-0-907606-49-9\nDreams and responsibilities: The state and arts in independent Ireland, Arts Council of Ireland (1990), ISBN 978-0-906627-32-7\nJack B Yeats: Jack Butler Yeats, 1871-1957 (Lives of Irish Artists), Unipub (October 1991), ISBN 978-0-948524-24-0\nThe Anatomy Lesson: Art and Medicine (with Davis Coakley), National Gallery of Ireland (January 1992), ISBN 978-0-903162-65-4\nIreland: Art into History (with Raymond Gillespie), Roberts Rinehart Publishers (1994), ISBN 978-1-57098-005-3\nIrish Painting, Roberts Rinehart Publishers (November 1997),  ISBN 978-1-86059-059-7\nSean Scully: The Art of the Stripe, Hood Museum of Art (October 2008), ISBN 978-0-944722-34-3\nFrank Stella: Irregular Polygons, 1965-1966, Hood Museum of Art (October 2010), ISBN 978-0-944722-39-8\n\nHonors and achievements\nKennedy was awarded the Australian Centenary Medal in 2001 for service to Australian Society and its art. He is a trustee and treasurer of the Association of Art Museum Directors, a peer reviewer for the American Association of Museums and a member of the International Association of Art Critics. In 2013 he was appointed inaugural eminent professor at the University of Toledo and received an honorary doctorate from Lourdes University. Most recently, Kennedy received the 2014 Northwest Region, Ohio Art Education Association award for distinguished educator for art education.\n\n\n== Notes ==\nPassage 4:\nDana Blankstein\nDana Blankstein-Cohen (born March 3, 1981) is the executive director of the Sam Spiegel Film and Television School.

His works include La Gar\u00e7onne (1936) and The Letter (1929). A French army officer and a designer, he first came to the United States with his parents, Count and Countess de Limur in September 1920; their destination was Burlingame, California, where lived Jean's brother Andr\u00e9 (who married Ethel, daughter of William Henry Crocker).\n\nFilmography\nThe Arab (1924) actor\nHuman Desires (1924)\nThe Legion of the Condemned (1928) co-screenplay\nThe Letter (1929) director\nJealousy (1929) director\nMy Childish Father (1930)\nPaprika (1933) director\nL'Auberge du Petit-Dragon (1935)\nLa Gar\u00e7onne (1936) director; with Arletty, Edith Piaf, and Marie Bell\nPassage 2:\nAndr\u00e9a Ferr\u00e9ol\nAndr\u00e9a Ferr\u00e9ol (born Andr\u00e9e Louise Ferr\u00e9ol; January 6, 1947) is a French actress and officer of the Ordre national du M\u00e9rite (2009).\nHer debut was in the 1973 film La Grande bouffe, which made a big scandal at the Cannes Film Festival.She was the last partner of Egyptian actor Omar Sharif.\n\nFilmography\nPassage 3:\nBrian Kennedy (gallery director)\nBrian Patrick Kennedy (born 5 November 1961) is an Irish-born art museum director who has worked in Ireland and Australia, and now lives and works in the United States.  He was the director of the Peabody Essex Museum in Salem for 17 months, resigning December 31, 2020. He was the director of the Toledo Museum of Art in Ohio from 2010 to 2019. He was the director of the Hood Museum of Art from 2005 to 2010, and the National Gallery of Australia (Canberra) from 1997 to 2004.\n\nCareer\nBrian Kennedy currently lives and works in the United States after leaving Australia in 2005 to direct the Hood Museum of Art at Dartmouth College. In October 2010 he became the ninth Director of the Toledo Museum of Art. On 1 July 2019, he succeeded Dan Monroe as the executive director and CEO of the Peabody Essex Museum.\n\nEarly life and career in Ireland\nKennedy was born in Dublin and attended Clonkeen College. He received B.A. (1982), M.A. (1985) and PhD (1989) degrees from University College-Dublin, where he studied both art history and history.\nHe worked in the Irish Department of Education (1982), the European Commission, Brussels (1983), and in Ireland at the Chester Beatty Library (1983\u201385), Government Publications Office (1985\u201386), and Department of Finance (1986\u201389). He married Mary Fiona Carlin in 1988.He was Assistant Director at the National Gallery of Ireland in Dublin from 1989 to 1997. He was Chair of the Irish Association of Art Historians from 1996 to 1997, and of the Council of Australian Art Museum Directors from 2001 to 2003. In September 1997 he became Director of the National Gallery of Australia.\n\nNational Gallery of Australia (NGA)\nKennedy expanded the traveling exhibitions and loans program throughout Australia, arranged for several major shows of Australian art abroad, increased the number of exhibitions at the museum itself and oversaw the development of an extensive multi-media site.  Although he oversaw several years of the museum's highest ever annual visitation, he discontinued the emphasis of his predecessor, Betty Churcher, on showing \"blockbuster\" exhibitions.\nDuring his directorship, the NGA gained government support for improving the building and significant private donations and corporate sponsorship. However, the initial design for the building proved controversial generating a public dispute with the original architect on moral rights grounds.  As a result, the project was not delivered during Dr Kennedy's tenure, with a significantly altered design completed some years later.  Private funding supported two acquisitions of British art, including David Hockney's A Bigger Grand Canyon in 1999, and Lucian Freud's After C\u00e9zanne in 2001. Kennedy built on the established collections at the museum by acquiring the Holmgren-Spertus collection of Indonesian textiles; the Kenneth Tyler collection of editioned prints, screens, multiples and unique proofs; and the Australian Print Workshop Archive. He was also notable for campaigning for the construction of a new \"front\" entrance to the Gallery, facing King Edward Terrace, which was completed in 2010 (see reference to the building project above).\nKennedy's cancellation of the \"Sensation exhibition\" (scheduled at the NGA from 2 June 2000 to 13 August 2000) was controversial, and seen by some as censorship. He claimed that the decision was due to the exhibition being \"too close to the market\" implying that a national cultural institution cannot exhibit the private collection of a speculative art investor. However, there were other exhibitions at the NGA during his tenure, which could have raised similar concerns. The exhibition featured the privately owned Young British Artists works belonging to Charles Saatchi and attracted large attendances in London and Brooklyn. Its most controversial work was Chris Ofili's The Holy Virgin Mary, a painting which used elephant dung and was accused of being blasphemous. The then-mayor of New York, Rudolph Giuliani, campaigned against the exhibition, claiming it was \"Catholic-bashing\" and an \"aggressive, vicious, disgusting attack on religion.\" In November 1999, Kennedy cancelled the exhibition and stated that the events in New York had \"obscured discussion of the artistic merit of the works of art\". He has said that it \"was the toughest decision of my professional life, so far.\"Kennedy was also repeatedly questioned on his management of a range of issues during the Australian Government's Senate Estimates process - particularly on the NGA's occupational health and safety record and concerns about the NGA's twenty-year-old air-conditioning system. The air-conditioning was finally renovated in 2003. Kennedy announced in 2002 that he would not seek extension of his contract beyond 2004, accepting a seven-year term as had his two predecessors.He became a joint Irish-Australian citizen in 2003.\n\nToledo Museum of Art\nThe Toledo Museum of Art is known for its exceptional collections of European and American paintings and sculpture, glass, antiquities, artist books, Japanese prints and netsuke. The museum offers free admission and is recognized for its historical leadership in the field of art education.  During his tenure, Kennedy has focused the museum's art education efforts on visual literacy, which he defines as \"learning to read, understand and write visual language.\"   Initiatives have included baby and toddler tours, specialized training for all staff, docents, volunteers and the launch of a website, www.vislit.org. In November 2014, the museum hosted the International Visual Literacy Association (IVLA) conference, the first Museum to do so. Kennedy has been a frequent speaker on the topic, including 2010 and 2013 TEDx talks on visual and sensory literacy.\nKennedy has expressed an interest in expanding the museum's collection of contemporary art and art by indigenous peoples. Works by Frank Stella, Sean Scully, Jaume Plensa, Ravinder Reddy and Mary Sibande have been acquired.  In addition, the museum has made major acquisitions of Old Master paintings by Frans Hals and Luca Giordano.During his tenure the Toledo Museum of Art has announced the return of several objects from its collection due to claims the objects were stolen and/or illegally exported prior being sold to the museum.  In 2011 a Meissen sweetmeat stand was returned to Germany followed by an Etruscan Kalpis or water jug to Italy (2013), an Indian sculpture of Ganesha (2014) and an astrological compendium to Germany in 2015.\n\nHood Museum of Art\nKennedy became Director of the Hood Museum of Art in July 2005. During his tenure, he implemented a series of large and small-scale exhibitions and oversaw the production of more than 20 publications to bring greater public attention to the museum's remarkable collections of the arts of America, Europe, Africa, Papua New Guinea and the Polar regions. At 70,000 objects, the Hood has one of the largest collections on any American college of university campus. The exhibition, Black Womanhood: Images, Icons, and Ideologies of the African Body, toured several US venues. Kennedy increased campus curricular use of works of art, with thousands of objects pulled from storage for classes annually. Numerous acquisitions were made with the museum's generous endowments, and he curated several exhibitions: including Wenda Gu: Forest of Stone Steles: Retranslation and Rewriting Tang Dynasty Poetry, Sean Scully: The Art of the Stripe, and Frank Stella: Irregular Polygons.\n\nPublications\nKennedy has written or edited a number of books on art, including:\n\nAlfred Chester Beatty and Ireland 1950-1968: A study in cultural politics, Glendale Press (1988), ISBN 978-0-907606-49-9\nDreams and responsibilities: The state and arts in independent Ireland, Arts Council of Ireland (1990), ISBN 978-0-906627-32-7\nJack B Yeats: Jack Butler Yeats, 1871-1957 (Lives of Irish Artists), Unipub (October 1991), ISBN 978-0-948524-24-0\nThe Anatomy Lesson: Art and Medicine (with Davis Coakley), National Gallery of Ireland (January 1992), ISBN 978-0-903162-65-4\nIreland: Art into History (with Raymond Gillespie), Roberts Rinehart Publishers (1994), ISBN 978-1-57098-005-3\nIrish Painting, Roberts Rinehart Publishers (November 1997),  ISBN 978-1-86059-059-7\nSean Scully: The Art of the Stripe, Hood Museum of Art (October 2008), ISBN 978-0-944722-34-3\nFrank Stella: Irregular Polygons, 1965-1966, Hood Museum of Art (October 2010), ISBN 978-0-944722-39-8\n\nHonors and achievements\nKennedy was awarded the Australian Centenary Medal in 2001 for service to Australian Society and its art. He is a trustee and treasurer of the Association of Art Museum Directors, a peer reviewer for the American Association of Museums and a member of the International Association of Art Critics. In 2013 he was appointed inaugural eminent professor at the University of Toledo and received an honorary doctorate from Lourdes University. Most recently, Kennedy received the 2014 Northwest Region, Ohio Art Education Association award for distinguished educator for art education.\n\n\n== Notes ==\nPassage 4:\nDana Blankstein\nDana Blankstein-Cohen (born March 3, 1981) is the executive director of the Sam Spiegel Film and Television School.

Pope John Paul II flew to this airport during his last visit to Cuba, flying a round trip between here and Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed International Airport in Havana. Likewise, Pope Benedict XVI, during the second papal visit to Cuba, flew here for Mass and other activities, from his visit to Le\u00f3n and Guanajuato in Mexico, before moving on to Havana.\nThe airport is basically a turbo-prop centre. Nevertheless, jet aircraft also fly to this airport. Most commercial flights into SCU are domestic, but there are about twenty international flights each week; while these international flights were at one point done mostly by domestic airlines, the international routes have nevertheless awakened the interest of some foreign airlines that have opened flights into this airport and might open more flights in the future.\n\nAirlines and destinations\nSantiago de Cuba Base\nThe airport was home to the Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces:\n\n35th Transport Regiment - Antonov An-2 and Antonov An-26 transports\n36th Helicopter Regiment - Mil Mi-8 and Mil Mi-24The helipads are now part of the executive jet terminal on the north end of the airport.\n\nAccidents and incidents\nOn 2 October 1959, a Viscount of Cubana de Aviaci\u00f3n was hijacked on a flight from Havana to Antonio Maceo Airport, Santiago de Cuba by three men demanding to be taken to the United States.

It has one runway designated 8/26 with an asphalt surface measuring 3,600 by 50 feet (1,097 x 15 m).For the 12-month period ending May 3, 2011, the airport had 15,000 general aviation aircraft operations, an average of 41 per day. At that time there were 71 aircraft based at this airport: 89% single-engine, 4% multi-engine, 1% helicopter, 3% glider, and 3% ultralight.The facility was designed by aeronautical engineer Sam Ramsey, who resided at the sleepy airport for years prior to the development. He envisioned an airport where pilots could commute to Los Angeles while enjoying the quiet High Desert as a residence.\n\nSee also\nList of airports in Kern County, California\nPassage 3:\nAmpanihy Airport\nAmpanihy Airport (IATA: AMP, ICAO: FMSY) is an airport located in Ampanihy, Madagascar.\n\nAirlines and destinations\n\n\n== Sources ==\nPassage 4:\nCrow Island Airport\nCrow Island Airport (also known as Crow Island Airpark) is a private airport along the Assabet River in Stow, Massachusetts, United States.

Later expanded to a 3250' x 240' runway with a single taxiway with 31 revetment areas. Bombed by the allies during late 1943 and early 1944 the airfield became unserviceable.\n\nImperial Japanese Army Air Force Units at Madang\nImperial Japanese Army Air Force\n\n59th Sentai (Nakajima Ki-43 Oscar)\n68th Sentai (Kawasaki Ki-61 Tony)\n248th Sentai (Nakajima Ki-43-III Oscar)\n\nAllied Liberation\nLiberated by Australian Army forces on 24 April 1944. A large amount of high octane fuel was captured and used by the Australians for use in the Royal Australian Navy motor launch boats. The airfield was repaired and used by the Royal Australian Air Force until the end of the war.\nPost WW2 in 1947, the Department of Civil Aviation sent an airport manager to Madang to oversee the building of the airport. Accommodation for the workers also had to be built as well as airplane hangars and a control tower. Wooden floors on concrete slabs were laid. Knitted woven bark for the walls was floated downstream, made by the natives, who were paid in cash. When the bark hut accommodation was ready, motor mechanics, radio technicians and other workers arrived along with wives and children.

Located about 3 miles (4.8 km) northeast of Downtown Cedar Park, it covers 25 acres (10.1 ha) and has one runway. It serves as the base for the fly-in community Breakaway Park.\n\nHistory\nFounding\nIn 1977, United States Marine Corps veteran and amateur pilot Walter Yates purchased land for the purpose of establishing a fly-in community. This land would become Breakaway Park, a subdivision of the City of Cedar Park that featured a 3,000 foot (914.4 m) grass runway at its center. Initially, Breakaway would consist of the single unpaved runway and a handful of hangars near its northern end, but would see continuous development that continues to the present day. The subdivision would be managed by Breakaway Park, Incorporated, of which Yates was the president until the company's dissolution on March 26, 2001.\n\nModern History\nOn January 1, 2008, Breakaway Park fell under the management of residents Donald Richie and Dennis Gale, operating as D&D Airport Holdings LLC.\n\nRunway Resurfacing\nOver the years 2014 and 2015, Breakaway's grass runway would be paved over with asphalt, but its length and width would remain unchanged.\n\nName Change\nIn 2014, Breakaway Airport's name would be changed to Hank Sasser/Breakaway Airport in honor of amateur pilot John Henry \"Hank\" Sasser.

The leader of the smuggling operation, Wu Ji, holds one of his own men hostage while taking cover behind a section of the facility's reinforced wall.\nLeng Feng, a skilled PLA sniper, ignores orders to stand down and fires three shots at a weak section of the wall, penetrating through on the third shot and killing Wu Ji. Leng Feng is sent to solitary confinement as punishment, but is approached by Long Xiaoyun, the female commander of the legendary 'Wolf Warriors', an elite unit within the PLA tasked with simulating foreign tactics for the PLA to train against. Long Xiaoyun offers Leng Feng a place in the Wolf Warriors. Meanwhile, in the Philippines, crime lord Min Deng, the older brother of Wu Ji, hires ex-US Navy SEAL \u201cTom Cat\u201d (Scott Adkins) and his group to assassinate Leng Feng and avenge his brother.\nThe Wolf Warriors participate in a training exercise in a remote and uninhabited forested region on China's southern border.

Subsequently, the PLA and the Wolf Warriors are tasked with hunting down Tom Cat\u2018s squad to restore their honor. The combined infantry force move into the forest but are delayed by multiple traps set by Tom Cat and pinned down by sniper fire until Leng Feng manages to kill the shooter. Afterwards, the rest of the PLA force engages Tom Cat's other mercenaries, who stage a fighting retreat but are eventually overwhelmed and killed one by one. Meanwhile, Long Xiaoyun and the other PLA commanders deduce that Ming Deng himself is also in the training area to take possession of a smuggled cache of biotechnology, which could allow the creation of a genetic weapon that could target Chinese people exclusively.\nLeng Feng eventually catches Tom Cat just before China's southern border. Leng Feng is nearly defeated, but manages to kill Tom Cat with his own knife. Medical personnel from a PLA relief force arrive, but Leng Feng recognises the wrist tattoo of the medic that approaches him and realizes that they are Min Deng's men in PLA uniforms.

He was the director of the Peabody Essex Museum in Salem for 17 months, resigning December 31, 2020. He was the director of the Toledo Museum of Art in Ohio from 2010 to 2019. He was the director of the Hood Museum of Art from 2005 to 2010, and the National Gallery of Australia (Canberra) from 1997 to 2004.\n\nCareer\nBrian Kennedy currently lives and works in the United States after leaving Australia in 2005 to direct the Hood Museum of Art at Dartmouth College. In October 2010 he became the ninth Director of the Toledo Museum of Art. On 1 July 2019, he succeeded Dan Monroe as the executive director and CEO of the Peabody Essex Museum.\n\nEarly life and career in Ireland\nKennedy was born in Dublin and attended Clonkeen College. He received B.A. (1982), M.A. (1985) and PhD (1989) degrees from University College-Dublin, where he studied both art history and history.\nHe worked in the Irish Department of Education (1982), the European Commission, Brussels (1983), and in Ireland at the Chester Beatty Library (1983\u201385), Government Publications Office (1985\u201386), and Department of Finance (1986\u201389). He married Mary Fiona Carlin in 1988.He was Assistant Director at the National Gallery of Ireland in Dublin from 1989 to 1997. He was Chair of the Irish Association of Art Historians from 1996 to 1997, and of the Council of Australian Art Museum Directors from 2001 to 2003. In September 1997 he became Director of the National Gallery of Australia.\n\nNational Gallery of Australia (NGA)\nKennedy expanded the traveling exhibitions and loans program throughout Australia, arranged for several major shows of Australian art abroad, increased the number of exhibitions at the museum itself and oversaw the development of an extensive multi-media site.  Although he oversaw several years of the museum's highest ever annual visitation, he discontinued the emphasis of his predecessor, Betty Churcher, on showing \"blockbuster\" exhibitions.\nDuring his directorship, the NGA gained government support for improving the building and significant private donations and corporate sponsorship. However, the initial design for the building proved controversial generating a public dispute with the original architect on moral rights grounds.  As a result, the project was not delivered during Dr Kennedy's tenure, with a significantly altered design completed some years later.  Private funding supported two acquisitions of British art, including David Hockney's A Bigger Grand Canyon in 1999, and Lucian Freud's After C\u00e9zanne in 2001. Kennedy built on the established collections at the museum by acquiring the Holmgren-Spertus collection of Indonesian textiles; the Kenneth Tyler collection of editioned prints, screens, multiples and unique proofs; and the Australian Print Workshop Archive. He was also notable for campaigning for the construction of a new \"front\" entrance to the Gallery, facing King Edward Terrace, which was completed in 2010 (see reference to the building project above).\nKennedy's cancellation of the \"Sensation exhibition\" (scheduled at the NGA from 2 June 2000 to 13 August 2000) was controversial, and seen by some as censorship. He claimed that the decision was due to the exhibition being \"too close to the market\" implying that a national cultural institution cannot exhibit the private collection of a speculative art investor. However, there were other exhibitions at the NGA during his tenure, which could have raised similar concerns. The exhibition featured the privately owned Young British Artists works belonging to Charles Saatchi and attracted large attendances in London and Brooklyn. Its most controversial work was Chris Ofili's The Holy Virgin Mary, a painting which used elephant dung and was accused of being blasphemous. The then-mayor of New York, Rudolph Giuliani, campaigned against the exhibition, claiming it was \"Catholic-bashing\" and an \"aggressive, vicious, disgusting attack on religion.\" In November 1999, Kennedy cancelled the exhibition and stated that the events in New York had \"obscured discussion of the artistic merit of the works of art\". He has said that it \"was the toughest decision of my professional life, so far.\"Kennedy was also repeatedly questioned on his management of a range of issues during the Australian Government's Senate Estimates process - particularly on the NGA's occupational health and safety record and concerns about the NGA's twenty-year-old air-conditioning system. The air-conditioning was finally renovated in 2003. Kennedy announced in 2002 that he would not seek extension of his contract beyond 2004, accepting a seven-year term as had his two predecessors.He became a joint Irish-Australian citizen in 2003.\n\nToledo Museum of Art\nThe Toledo Museum of Art is known for its exceptional collections of European and American paintings and sculpture, glass, antiquities, artist books, Japanese prints and netsuke. The museum offers free admission and is recognized for its historical leadership in the field of art education.  During his tenure, Kennedy has focused the museum's art education efforts on visual literacy, which he defines as \"learning to read, understand and write visual language.\"   Initiatives have included baby and toddler tours, specialized training for all staff, docents, volunteers and the launch of a website, www.vislit.org. In November 2014, the museum hosted the International Visual Literacy Association (IVLA) conference, the first Museum to do so. Kennedy has been a frequent speaker on the topic, including 2010 and 2013 TEDx talks on visual and sensory literacy.\nKennedy has expressed an interest in expanding the museum's collection of contemporary art and art by indigenous peoples. Works by Frank Stella, Sean Scully, Jaume Plensa, Ravinder Reddy and Mary Sibande have been acquired.  In addition, the museum has made major acquisitions of Old Master paintings by Frans Hals and Luca Giordano.During his tenure the Toledo Museum of Art has announced the return of several objects from its collection due to claims the objects were stolen and/or illegally exported prior being sold to the museum.  In 2011 a Meissen sweetmeat stand was returned to Germany followed by an Etruscan Kalpis or water jug to Italy (2013), an Indian sculpture of Ganesha (2014) and an astrological compendium to Germany in 2015.\n\nHood Museum of Art\nKennedy became Director of the Hood Museum of Art in July 2005. During his tenure, he implemented a series of large and small-scale exhibitions and oversaw the production of more than 20 publications to bring greater public attention to the museum's remarkable collections of the arts of America, Europe, Africa, Papua New Guinea and the Polar regions. At 70,000 objects, the Hood has one of the largest collections on any American college of university campus. The exhibition, Black Womanhood: Images, Icons, and Ideologies of the African Body, toured several US venues. Kennedy increased campus curricular use of works of art, with thousands of objects pulled from storage for classes annually. Numerous acquisitions were made with the museum's generous endowments, and he curated several exhibitions: including Wenda Gu: Forest of Stone Steles: Retranslation and Rewriting Tang Dynasty Poetry, Sean Scully: The Art of the Stripe, and Frank Stella: Irregular Polygons.\n\nPublications\nKennedy has written or edited a number of books on art, including:\n\nAlfred Chester Beatty and Ireland 1950-1968: A study in cultural politics, Glendale Press (1988), ISBN 978-0-907606-49-9\nDreams and responsibilities: The state and arts in independent Ireland, Arts Council of Ireland (1990), ISBN 978-0-906627-32-7\nJack B Yeats: Jack Butler Yeats, 1871-1957 (Lives of Irish Artists), Unipub (October 1991), ISBN 978-0-948524-24-0\nThe Anatomy Lesson: Art and Medicine (with Davis Coakley), National Gallery of Ireland (January 1992), ISBN 978-0-903162-65-4\nIreland: Art into History (with Raymond Gillespie), Roberts Rinehart Publishers (1994), ISBN 978-1-57098-005-3\nIrish Painting, Roberts Rinehart Publishers (November 1997),  ISBN 978-1-86059-059-7\nSean Scully: The Art of the Stripe, Hood Museum of Art (October 2008), ISBN 978-0-944722-34-3\nFrank Stella: Irregular Polygons, 1965-1966, Hood Museum of Art (October 2010), ISBN 978-0-944722-39-8\n\nHonors and achievements\nKennedy was awarded the Australian Centenary Medal in 2001 for service to Australian Society and its art. He is a trustee and treasurer of the Association of Art Museum Directors, a peer reviewer for the American Association of Museums and a member of the International Association of Art Critics. In 2013 he was appointed inaugural eminent professor at the University of Toledo and received an honorary doctorate from Lourdes University. Most recently, Kennedy received the 2014 Northwest Region, Ohio Art Education Association award for distinguished educator for art education.\n\n\n== Notes ==\nPassage 7:\nPeter Levin\nPeter Levin is an American director of film, television and theatre.\n\nCareer\nSince 1967, Levin has amassed a large number of credits directing episodic television and television films.

When asked about his favorite films of his formative years Sandler said, \"I fell in love with Jean Luc Godard\u2019s Contempt and Weekend. I was blown away by Agnes Varda\u2019s Cleo from 5 to 7. Michelangelo Antonioni\u2019s films really struck a chord with me as well. After seeing L\u2019Avventura and Blowup, I went online and ordered every film of his I could find. The Passenger\u2019s penultimate shot blew me away. I watched that 7 minute shot over and over. It\u2019s probably my favorite shot in the history of cinema.\"\n\nCritical reception\nAngelica Jade Bastien for Roger Ebert wrote of the film, \"In 'Live Cargo,' director/co-writer Logan Sandler strives to tell a story that finds poetry in the commonplace by shirking narrative conventions.\"Chuck Wilson for The Village Voice wrote, \"The well-acted Live Cargo, which also features Robert Wisdom and Sam Dillon, is at its best when it observes character acting silently against landscape, as when Nadine goes snorkeling and uses a spear gun to jab at sharks, a juxtaposition of natural beauty and human fury typical of Sandler\u2019s poetic approach.\u201d Wilson as well called Sandler \"a filmmaker to watch.\"Katie Walsh in her IndieWire review wrote, \u201dAnchored by a quartet of equally strong and understated performances, LIVE CARGO proves itself to be a singularly artful film of great emotional heft.\u201d  Walsh gave the film an A - grade.Stephen Saito for The Moveable Fest in his review and interview wrote, \"While there\u2019s intrigue aplenty as anxieties rise higher than the tide, the assured hand of director Logan Sandler, who co-wrote the script with Thymaya Payne, guides 'Live Cargo' admirably as a thriller that may appear immediately as monochrome but shifts quickly into varying degrees of grey.\u201dH. Nelson Tracey of Cinemacy wrote that Sandler's, \u201cLive Cargo is an unforgettable debut and a promise of greater heights to come.\u201dJustin Lowe of the Hollywood Reporter in his review stated, \u201cA pronounced sense of style and place suffuses the entire film, boding well for Sandler\u2019s future projects.\u201d\n\nAwards/Nominations\nPassage 9:\nIan Barry (director)\nIan Barry is an Australian director of film and TV.\n\nSelect credits\nWaiting for Lucas (1973) (short)\nStone (1974) (editor only)\nThe Chain Reaction (1980)\nWhose Baby?

Although he oversaw several years of the museum's highest ever annual visitation, he discontinued the emphasis of his predecessor, Betty Churcher, on showing \"blockbuster\" exhibitions.\nDuring his directorship, the NGA gained government support for improving the building and significant private donations and corporate sponsorship. However, the initial design for the building proved controversial generating a public dispute with the original architect on moral rights grounds.  As a result, the project was not delivered during Dr Kennedy's tenure, with a significantly altered design completed some years later.  Private funding supported two acquisitions of British art, including David Hockney's A Bigger Grand Canyon in 1999, and Lucian Freud's After C\u00e9zanne in 2001. Kennedy built on the established collections at the museum by acquiring the Holmgren-Spertus collection of Indonesian textiles; the Kenneth Tyler collection of editioned prints, screens, multiples and unique proofs; and the Australian Print Workshop Archive. He was also notable for campaigning for the construction of a new \"front\" entrance to the Gallery, facing King Edward Terrace, which was completed in 2010 (see reference to the building project above).\nKennedy's cancellation of the \"Sensation exhibition\" (scheduled at the NGA from 2 June 2000 to 13 August 2000) was controversial, and seen by some as censorship. He claimed that the decision was due to the exhibition being \"too close to the market\" implying that a national cultural institution cannot exhibit the private collection of a speculative art investor. However, there were other exhibitions at the NGA during his tenure, which could have raised similar concerns. The exhibition featured the privately owned Young British Artists works belonging to Charles Saatchi and attracted large attendances in London and Brooklyn. Its most controversial work was Chris Ofili's The Holy Virgin Mary, a painting which used elephant dung and was accused of being blasphemous. The then-mayor of New York, Rudolph Giuliani, campaigned against the exhibition, claiming it was \"Catholic-bashing\" and an \"aggressive, vicious, disgusting attack on religion.\" In November 1999, Kennedy cancelled the exhibition and stated that the events in New York had \"obscured discussion of the artistic merit of the works of art\". He has said that it \"was the toughest decision of my professional life, so far.\"Kennedy was also repeatedly questioned on his management of a range of issues during the Australian Government's Senate Estimates process - particularly on the NGA's occupational health and safety record and concerns about the NGA's twenty-year-old air-conditioning system. The air-conditioning was finally renovated in 2003. Kennedy announced in 2002 that he would not seek extension of his contract beyond 2004, accepting a seven-year term as had his two predecessors.He became a joint Irish-Australian citizen in 2003.\n\nToledo Museum of Art\nThe Toledo Museum of Art is known for its exceptional collections of European and American paintings and sculpture, glass, antiquities, artist books, Japanese prints and netsuke. The museum offers free admission and is recognized for its historical leadership in the field of art education.  During his tenure, Kennedy has focused the museum's art education efforts on visual literacy, which he defines as \"learning to read, understand and write visual language.\"   Initiatives have included baby and toddler tours, specialized training for all staff, docents, volunteers and the launch of a website, www.vislit.org. In November 2014, the museum hosted the International Visual Literacy Association (IVLA) conference, the first Museum to do so. Kennedy has been a frequent speaker on the topic, including 2010 and 2013 TEDx talks on visual and sensory literacy.\nKennedy has expressed an interest in expanding the museum's collection of contemporary art and art by indigenous peoples. Works by Frank Stella, Sean Scully, Jaume Plensa, Ravinder Reddy and Mary Sibande have been acquired.  In addition, the museum has made major acquisitions of Old Master paintings by Frans Hals and Luca Giordano.During his tenure the Toledo Museum of Art has announced the return of several objects from its collection due to claims the objects were stolen and/or illegally exported prior being sold to the museum.  In 2011 a Meissen sweetmeat stand was returned to Germany followed by an Etruscan Kalpis or water jug to Italy (2013), an Indian sculpture of Ganesha (2014) and an astrological compendium to Germany in 2015.\n\nHood Museum of Art\nKennedy became Director of the Hood Museum of Art in July 2005. During his tenure, he implemented a series of large and small-scale exhibitions and oversaw the production of more than 20 publications to bring greater public attention to the museum's remarkable collections of the arts of America, Europe, Africa, Papua New Guinea and the Polar regions. At 70,000 objects, the Hood has one of the largest collections on any American college of university campus. The exhibition, Black Womanhood: Images, Icons, and Ideologies of the African Body, toured several US venues. Kennedy increased campus curricular use of works of art, with thousands of objects pulled from storage for classes annually. Numerous acquisitions were made with the museum's generous endowments, and he curated several exhibitions: including Wenda Gu: Forest of Stone Steles: Retranslation and Rewriting Tang Dynasty Poetry, Sean Scully: The Art of the Stripe, and Frank Stella: Irregular Polygons.\n\nPublications\nKennedy has written or edited a number of books on art, including:\n\nAlfred Chester Beatty and Ireland 1950-1968: A study in cultural politics, Glendale Press (1988), ISBN 978-0-907606-49-9\nDreams and responsibilities: The state and arts in independent Ireland, Arts Council of Ireland (1990), ISBN 978-0-906627-32-7\nJack B Yeats: Jack Butler Yeats, 1871-1957 (Lives of Irish Artists), Unipub (October 1991), ISBN 978-0-948524-24-0\nThe Anatomy Lesson: Art and Medicine (with Davis Coakley), National Gallery of Ireland (January 1992), ISBN 978-0-903162-65-4\nIreland: Art into History (with Raymond Gillespie), Roberts Rinehart Publishers (1994), ISBN 978-1-57098-005-3\nIrish Painting, Roberts Rinehart Publishers (November 1997),  ISBN 978-1-86059-059-7\nSean Scully: The Art of the Stripe, Hood Museum of Art (October 2008), ISBN 978-0-944722-34-3\nFrank Stella: Irregular Polygons, 1965-1966, Hood Museum of Art (October 2010), ISBN 978-0-944722-39-8\n\nHonors and achievements\nKennedy was awarded the Australian Centenary Medal in 2001 for service to Australian Society and its art. He is a trustee and treasurer of the Association of Art Museum Directors, a peer reviewer for the American Association of Museums and a member of the International Association of Art Critics. In 2013 he was appointed inaugural eminent professor at the University of Toledo and received an honorary doctorate from Lourdes University. Most recently, Kennedy received the 2014 Northwest Region, Ohio Art Education Association award for distinguished educator for art education.\n\n\n== Notes ==\nPassage 7:\nPeter Levin\nPeter Levin is an American director of film, television and theatre.\n\nCareer\nSince 1967, Levin has amassed a large number of credits directing episodic television and television films.

Michelangelo Antonioni\u2019s films really struck a chord with me as well. After seeing L\u2019Avventura and Blowup, I went online and ordered every film of his I could find. The Passenger\u2019s penultimate shot blew me away. I watched that 7 minute shot over and over. It\u2019s probably my favorite shot in the history of cinema.\"\n\nCritical reception\nAngelica Jade Bastien for Roger Ebert wrote of the film, \"In 'Live Cargo,' director/co-writer Logan Sandler strives to tell a story that finds poetry in the commonplace by shirking narrative conventions.\"Chuck Wilson for The Village Voice wrote, \"The well-acted Live Cargo, which also features Robert Wisdom and Sam Dillon, is at its best when it observes character acting silently against landscape, as when Nadine goes snorkeling and uses a spear gun to jab at sharks, a juxtaposition of natural beauty and human fury typical of Sandler\u2019s poetic approach.\u201d Wilson as well called Sandler \"a filmmaker to watch.\"Katie Walsh in her IndieWire review wrote, \u201dAnchored by a quartet of equally strong and understated performances, LIVE CARGO proves itself to be a singularly artful film of great emotional heft.\u201d  Walsh gave the film an A - grade.Stephen Saito for The Moveable Fest in his review and interview wrote, \"While there\u2019s intrigue aplenty as anxieties rise higher than the tide, the assured hand of director Logan Sandler, who co-wrote the script with Thymaya Payne, guides 'Live Cargo' admirably as a thriller that may appear immediately as monochrome but shifts quickly into varying degrees of grey.\u201dH. Nelson Tracey of Cinemacy wrote that Sandler's, \u201cLive Cargo is an unforgettable debut and a promise of greater heights to come.\u201dJustin Lowe of the Hollywood Reporter in his review stated, \u201cA pronounced sense of style and place suffuses the entire film, boding well for Sandler\u2019s future projects.\u201d\n\nAwards/Nominations\nPassage 9:\nIan Barry (director)\nIan Barry is an Australian director of film and TV.\n\nSelect credits\nWaiting for Lucas (1973) (short)\nStone (1974) (editor only)\nThe Chain Reaction (1980)\nWhose Baby?

Confessing his feelings by writing in her yearbook, he attends their graduation party. As he returns Jamie's yearbook, it is swapped by her ex-boyfriend, Tim, who reads the declaration aloud to everyone, humiliating Chris. After kissing him on the cheek, Jamie admits she does not reciprocate his affections. He leaves the party in tears, announcing he will never return and vowing to be more successful than everyone else.\nTen years later, a womanizing Chris has lost weight and lives in Los Angeles as a highly successful record producer and vice president of the company. Before Christmas, company CEO KC, asks him to accompany emerging, self-obsessed pop singer Samantha James to Paris so she signs with their label, and Chris reluctantly complies. She wants a relationship with him but he has no interest after their only date previously led to his hospitalization. On the way to Paris, Samantha accidentally sets her private jet on fire, causing an emergency landing in New Jersey, near Chris's hometown.\nChris takes Samantha to his mother's for the night and re-engages with his teenage past, including his unresolved feelings for Jamie.

At the local bar, Chris encounters some old classmates, including his other best friend Clark and his wife Darla.\nHe also sees Jamie, working as a bartender to pay for graduate school for teaching. Chris asks Mike to keep Samantha busy during his date with Jamie, but realizing their platonic friendship is important to him hampers his plan for them to have sex.

At the scene, Jamie is reunited with Dusty Dinkleman, a paramedic and former high school classmate also in love with her.\nThe next night, Chris goes to Jamie's Christmas party to express his feelings for her, but Dusty is already there, charming everyone on guitar. Back at Chris's, Samantha ambushes Mike, demanding he reveal Chris's location. He refuses until she gives him a kiss. In a rage, she drives to Jamie's, crashing through her fence and destroying the Christmas decorations. Chris returns home in embarrassment, and Jamie follows. She tells him she is not mad and they end up spending the night catching up and reminiscing. However, due to Chris's continuing lack of assertion, they end up just sleeping and nothing happens.\nThe next day, Jamie speaks with Darla about the night before, while Chris goes to Clark for advice.

He was on the side of the English in 1304 under the orders of John de Botetourt, Justiciar of Galloway, Annan, and the valley of the Nith. Domhnall was part of the jury that, on 31 August 1304, undertook an inquiry as to certain privileges claimed by Robert de Brus, Earl of Carrick.

The latter's attestations suggest that he was a contestant to the Clann Domhnaill lordship, and may have possessed the chiefship.\n\nCitations\nPassage 9:\nAbd al-Muttalib\nShayba ibn H\u0101shim (Arabic: \u0634\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0628\u064e\u0629 \u0625\u0628\u0652\u0646 \u0647\u064e\u0627\u0634\u0650\u0645; c.\u2009497\u2013578), better known as \u02bfAbd al-Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib, (Arabic: \u0639\u064e\u0628\u0652\u062f \u0671\u0644\u0652\u0645\u064f\u0637\u064e\u0651\u0644\u0650\u0628, lit.\u2009'Servant of Muttalib') was the fourth chief of the Quraysh tribal confederation. He was the grandfather of the Islamic prophet Muhammad.\n\nEarly life\nHis father was Hashim ibn 'Abd Manaf,:\u200a81\u200a the progenitor of the distinguished Banu Hashim, a clan of the Quraysh tribe of Mecca. They claimed descent from Ism\u0101'\u012bl and Ibr\u0101h\u012bm. His mother was Salma bint Amr, from the Banu Najjar, a clan of the Khazraj tribe in Yathrib (later called Madinah). Hashim died while doing business in Gaza, before Abd al-Muttalib was born.:\u200a81\u200aHis real name was \"Shaiba\" meaning 'the ancient one' or 'white-haired' because of the streak of white through his jet-black hair, and is sometimes also called Shaybah al-\u1e24amd (\"The white streak of praise\").:\u200a81\u201382\u200a After his father's death he was raised in Yathrib with his mother and her family until about the age of eight, when his uncle Muttalib ibn Abd Manaf went to see him and asked his mother Salmah to entrust Shaybah to his care. Salmah was unwilling to let her son go and Shaiba refused to leave his mother without her consent. Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib then pointed out that the possibilities Yathrib had to offer were incomparable to Mecca. Salmah was impressed with his arguments, so she agreed to let him go. Upon first arriving in Mecca, the people assumed the unknown child was Muttalib's servant and started calling him 'Abd al-Muttalib (\"servant of Muttalib\").:\u200a85\u201386\n\nChieftain of Hashim clan\nWhen Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib died, Shaiba succeeded him as the chief of the H\u0101shim clan. Following his uncle Al-Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib, he took over the duties of providing the pilgrims with food and water, and carried on the practices of his forefathers with his people. He attained such eminence as none of his forefathers enjoyed; his people loved him and his reputation was great among them.:\u200a61\u200a\n'Umar ibn Al-Kha\u1e6d\u1e6d\u0101b's grandfather Nufayl ibn Abdul Uzza arbitrated in a dispute between 'Abdul-Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib and \u1e24arb ibn Umayyah, Abu Sufyan's father, over the custodianship of the Kaaba. Nufayl gave his verdict in favour of 'Abdul-Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib. Addressing \u1e24arb ibn Umayyah, he said:\nWhy do you pick a quarrel with a person who is taller than you in stature; more imposing than you in appearance; more refined than you in intellect; whose progeny outnumbers yours and whose generosity outshines yours in lustre? Do not, however, construe this into any disparagement of your good qualities which I highly appreciate. You are as gentle as a lamb, you are renowned throughout Arabia for the stentorian tones of your voice, and you are an asset to your tribe.\n\nDiscovery of Zam Zam Well\n'Abdul-Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib said that while sleeping in the sacred enclosure, he had dreamed he was ordered to dig at the worship place of the Quraysh between the two deities Is\u0101f and N\u0101'ila. There he would find the Zamzam Well, which the Jurhum tribe had filled in when they left Mecca. The Quraysh tried to stop him digging in that spot, but his son Al-\u1e24\u0101rith stood guard until they gave up their protests. After three days of digging, 'Abdul-Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib found traces of an ancient religious well and exclaimed, \"Allahuakbar!\" Some of the Quraysh disputed his claim to sole rights over water, then one of them suggested that they go to a female shaman who lived afar. It was said that she could summon jinns and that she could help them decide who was the owner of the well. So, 11 people from the 11 tribes went on the expedition. They had to cross the desert to meet the priestess but then they got lost. There was a lack of food and water and people started to lose hope of ever getting out. One of them suggested that they dig their own graves and if they died, the last person standing would bury the others. So all began digging their own graves and just as Abdul-Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib started digging, water spewed out from the hole he dug and everyone became overjoyed. It was then and there decided that Abdul-Muttalib was the owner of the Zam Zam well. Thereafter he supplied pilgrims to the Kaaba with Zam Zam water, which soon eclipsed all the other wells in Mecca because it was considered sacred.:\u200a86\u201389\u200a:\u200a62\u201365\n\nThe Year of the Elephant\nAccording to Muslim tradition, the Ethiopian governor of Yemen, Abrahah al-Ashram, envied the Kaaba's reverence among the Arabs and, being a Christian, he built a cathedral on Sana'a and ordered pilgrimage be made there.:\u200a21\u200a The order was ignored and someone desecrated (some saying in the form of defecation:\u200a696 note 35\u200a) the cathedral. Abrahah decided to avenge this act by demolishing the Kaaba and he advanced with an army towards Mecca.:\u200a22\u201323\u200aThere were thirteen elephants in Abrahah's army:\u200a99\u200a:\u200a26\u200a and the year came to be known as '\u0100m al-F\u012bl (the Year of the Elephant), beginning a trend for reckoning the years in Arabia which was used until 'Umar ibn Al-Kha\u1e6d\u1e6d\u0101b replaced it with the Islamic Calendar in 638 CE (17 AH), with the first year of the Islamic Calendar being 622 CE.\nWhen news of the advance of Abrahah's army came, the Arab tribes of Quraysh, Kin\u0101nah, Khuz\u0101'ah and Hudhayl united in defence of the Kaaba. A man from the \u1e24imyar tribe was sent by Abrahah to advise them that he only wished to demolish the Kaaba and if they resisted, they would be crushed. \"Abdul-Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib told the Meccans to seek refuge in the nearest high hills while he, with some leading members of Quraysh, remained within the precincts of the Kaaba. Abrahah sent a dispatch inviting 'Abdul-Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib to meet him and discuss matters. When 'Abdul-Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib left the meeting he was heard saying, \"The Owner of this House is its Defender, and I am sure He will save it from the attack of the adversaries and will not dishonour the servants of His House.\":\u200a24\u201326\u200aIt is recorded that when Abrahah's forces neared the Kaaba, Allah commanded small birds (ab\u0101b\u012bl) to destroy Abrahah's army, raining down pebbles on it from their beaks. Abrahah was seriously wounded and retreated towards Yemen but died on the way.:\u200a26\u201327\u200a This event is referred to in the following Qur'anic chapter:\n\nHave you not seen how your Lord dealt with the owners of the Elephant?\nDid He not make their treacherous plan go astray?\n\nAnd He sent against them birds in flocks, striking them with stones of baked clay, so He rendered them like straw eaten up.\nMost Islamic sources place the event around the year that Muhammad was born, 570 CE, though other scholars place it one or two decades earlier. A tradition attributed to Ibn Shihab al-Zuhri in the musannaf of \u02bdAbd al-Razzaq al-San\u02bdani places it before the birth of Muhammad's father.\n\nSacrificing his son Abdullah\nAl-Harith was 'Abdul-Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib's only son at the time he dug the Zamzam Well.:\u200a64\u200a When the Quraysh tried to help him in the digging, he vowed that if he were to have ten sons to protect him, he would sacrifice one of them to Allah at the Kaaba. Later, after nine more sons had been born to him, he told them he must keep the vow. The divination arrows fell upon his favourite son Abdullah. The Quraysh protested 'Abdul-Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib's intention to sacrifice his son and demanded that he sacrifice something else instead. 'Abdul-Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib agreed to consult a \"sorceress with a familiar spirit\". She told him to cast lots between Abdullah and ten camels. If Abdullah were chosen, he had to add ten more camels, and keep on doing the same until his Lord accepted the camels in Abdullah's place. When the number of camels reached 100, the lot fell on the camels. 'Abdul-Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib confirmed this by repeating the test three times. Then the camels were sacrificed, and Abdullah was spared.:\u200a66\u201368\n\nFamily\nWives\nAbd al-Muttalib had six known wives.\n\nSumra bint Jundab of the Hawazin tribe.\nLubn\u0101 bint H\u0101jar of the Khuza'a tribe.\nFatima bint Amr of the Makhzum clan of the Quraysh tribe.\nHalah bint Wuhayb of the Zuhrah clan of the Quraysh tribe.\nNat\u012bla bint Janab of the Namir tribe.\nMumanna'a bint Amr of the Khuza'a tribe.\n\nChildren\nAccording to Ibn Hisham, \u02bfAbd al-Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib had ten sons and six daughters.:\u200a707\u2013708 note 97\u200a However, Ibn Sa'd lists twelve sons.:\u200a99\u2013101\u200aBy Sumra bint Jundab:\n\nAl-\u1e24\u0101rith.:\u200a708\u200a He was the firstborn and he died before his father.:\u200a99\u200a\nQuthum.:\u200a100\u200a He is not listed by Ibn Hisham.By Fatima bint Amr:\n\nAl-Zubayr.:\u200a707\u200a He was a poet and a chief; his father made a will in his favour.:\u200a99\u200a He died before Islam, leaving two sons and daughters.:\u200a101\u200a:\u200a34\u201335\u200a\nAbu Talib, born as Abd Manaf,:\u200a99\u200a:\u200a707\u200a father of the future Caliph Ali.

He was on the side of the English in 1304 under the orders of John de Botetourt, Justiciar of Galloway, Annan, and the valley of the Nith. Domhnall was part of the jury that, on 31 August 1304, undertook an inquiry as to certain privileges claimed by Robert de Brus, Earl of Carrick.

The latter's attestations suggest that he was a contestant to the Clann Domhnaill lordship, and may have possessed the chiefship.\n\nCitations\nPassage 9:\nAbd al-Muttalib\nShayba ibn H\u0101shim (Arabic: \u0634\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0628\u064e\u0629 \u0625\u0628\u0652\u0646 \u0647\u064e\u0627\u0634\u0650\u0645; c.\u2009497\u2013578), better known as \u02bfAbd al-Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib, (Arabic: \u0639\u064e\u0628\u0652\u062f \u0671\u0644\u0652\u0645\u064f\u0637\u064e\u0651\u0644\u0650\u0628, lit.\u2009'Servant of Muttalib') was the fourth chief of the Quraysh tribal confederation. He was the grandfather of the Islamic prophet Muhammad.\n\nEarly life\nHis father was Hashim ibn 'Abd Manaf,:\u200a81\u200a the progenitor of the distinguished Banu Hashim, a clan of the Quraysh tribe of Mecca. They claimed descent from Ism\u0101'\u012bl and Ibr\u0101h\u012bm. His mother was Salma bint Amr, from the Banu Najjar, a clan of the Khazraj tribe in Yathrib (later called Madinah). Hashim died while doing business in Gaza, before Abd al-Muttalib was born.:\u200a81\u200aHis real name was \"Shaiba\" meaning 'the ancient one' or 'white-haired' because of the streak of white through his jet-black hair, and is sometimes also called Shaybah al-\u1e24amd (\"The white streak of praise\").:\u200a81\u201382\u200a After his father's death he was raised in Yathrib with his mother and her family until about the age of eight, when his uncle Muttalib ibn Abd Manaf went to see him and asked his mother Salmah to entrust Shaybah to his care. Salmah was unwilling to let her son go and Shaiba refused to leave his mother without her consent. Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib then pointed out that the possibilities Yathrib had to offer were incomparable to Mecca. Salmah was impressed with his arguments, so she agreed to let him go. Upon first arriving in Mecca, the people assumed the unknown child was Muttalib's servant and started calling him 'Abd al-Muttalib (\"servant of Muttalib\").:\u200a85\u201386\n\nChieftain of Hashim clan\nWhen Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib died, Shaiba succeeded him as the chief of the H\u0101shim clan. Following his uncle Al-Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib, he took over the duties of providing the pilgrims with food and water, and carried on the practices of his forefathers with his people. He attained such eminence as none of his forefathers enjoyed; his people loved him and his reputation was great among them.:\u200a61\u200a\n'Umar ibn Al-Kha\u1e6d\u1e6d\u0101b's grandfather Nufayl ibn Abdul Uzza arbitrated in a dispute between 'Abdul-Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib and \u1e24arb ibn Umayyah, Abu Sufyan's father, over the custodianship of the Kaaba. Nufayl gave his verdict in favour of 'Abdul-Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib. Addressing \u1e24arb ibn Umayyah, he said:\nWhy do you pick a quarrel with a person who is taller than you in stature; more imposing than you in appearance; more refined than you in intellect; whose progeny outnumbers yours and whose generosity outshines yours in lustre? Do not, however, construe this into any disparagement of your good qualities which I highly appreciate. You are as gentle as a lamb, you are renowned throughout Arabia for the stentorian tones of your voice, and you are an asset to your tribe.\n\nDiscovery of Zam Zam Well\n'Abdul-Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib said that while sleeping in the sacred enclosure, he had dreamed he was ordered to dig at the worship place of the Quraysh between the two deities Is\u0101f and N\u0101'ila. There he would find the Zamzam Well, which the Jurhum tribe had filled in when they left Mecca. The Quraysh tried to stop him digging in that spot, but his son Al-\u1e24\u0101rith stood guard until they gave up their protests. After three days of digging, 'Abdul-Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib found traces of an ancient religious well and exclaimed, \"Allahuakbar!\" Some of the Quraysh disputed his claim to sole rights over water, then one of them suggested that they go to a female shaman who lived afar. It was said that she could summon jinns and that she could help them decide who was the owner of the well. So, 11 people from the 11 tribes went on the expedition. They had to cross the desert to meet the priestess but then they got lost. There was a lack of food and water and people started to lose hope of ever getting out. One of them suggested that they dig their own graves and if they died, the last person standing would bury the others. So all began digging their own graves and just as Abdul-Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib started digging, water spewed out from the hole he dug and everyone became overjoyed. It was then and there decided that Abdul-Muttalib was the owner of the Zam Zam well. Thereafter he supplied pilgrims to the Kaaba with Zam Zam water, which soon eclipsed all the other wells in Mecca because it was considered sacred.:\u200a86\u201389\u200a:\u200a62\u201365\n\nThe Year of the Elephant\nAccording to Muslim tradition, the Ethiopian governor of Yemen, Abrahah al-Ashram, envied the Kaaba's reverence among the Arabs and, being a Christian, he built a cathedral on Sana'a and ordered pilgrimage be made there.:\u200a21\u200a The order was ignored and someone desecrated (some saying in the form of defecation:\u200a696 note 35\u200a) the cathedral. Abrahah decided to avenge this act by demolishing the Kaaba and he advanced with an army towards Mecca.:\u200a22\u201323\u200aThere were thirteen elephants in Abrahah's army:\u200a99\u200a:\u200a26\u200a and the year came to be known as '\u0100m al-F\u012bl (the Year of the Elephant), beginning a trend for reckoning the years in Arabia which was used until 'Umar ibn Al-Kha\u1e6d\u1e6d\u0101b replaced it with the Islamic Calendar in 638 CE (17 AH), with the first year of the Islamic Calendar being 622 CE.\nWhen news of the advance of Abrahah's army came, the Arab tribes of Quraysh, Kin\u0101nah, Khuz\u0101'ah and Hudhayl united in defence of the Kaaba. A man from the \u1e24imyar tribe was sent by Abrahah to advise them that he only wished to demolish the Kaaba and if they resisted, they would be crushed. \"Abdul-Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib told the Meccans to seek refuge in the nearest high hills while he, with some leading members of Quraysh, remained within the precincts of the Kaaba. Abrahah sent a dispatch inviting 'Abdul-Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib to meet him and discuss matters. When 'Abdul-Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib left the meeting he was heard saying, \"The Owner of this House is its Defender, and I am sure He will save it from the attack of the adversaries and will not dishonour the servants of His House.\":\u200a24\u201326\u200aIt is recorded that when Abrahah's forces neared the Kaaba, Allah commanded small birds (ab\u0101b\u012bl) to destroy Abrahah's army, raining down pebbles on it from their beaks. Abrahah was seriously wounded and retreated towards Yemen but died on the way.:\u200a26\u201327\u200a This event is referred to in the following Qur'anic chapter:\n\nHave you not seen how your Lord dealt with the owners of the Elephant?\nDid He not make their treacherous plan go astray?\n\nAnd He sent against them birds in flocks, striking them with stones of baked clay, so He rendered them like straw eaten up.\nMost Islamic sources place the event around the year that Muhammad was born, 570 CE, though other scholars place it one or two decades earlier. A tradition attributed to Ibn Shihab al-Zuhri in the musannaf of \u02bdAbd al-Razzaq al-San\u02bdani places it before the birth of Muhammad's father.\n\nSacrificing his son Abdullah\nAl-Harith was 'Abdul-Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib's only son at the time he dug the Zamzam Well.:\u200a64\u200a When the Quraysh tried to help him in the digging, he vowed that if he were to have ten sons to protect him, he would sacrifice one of them to Allah at the Kaaba. Later, after nine more sons had been born to him, he told them he must keep the vow. The divination arrows fell upon his favourite son Abdullah. The Quraysh protested 'Abdul-Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib's intention to sacrifice his son and demanded that he sacrifice something else instead. 'Abdul-Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib agreed to consult a \"sorceress with a familiar spirit\". She told him to cast lots between Abdullah and ten camels. If Abdullah were chosen, he had to add ten more camels, and keep on doing the same until his Lord accepted the camels in Abdullah's place. When the number of camels reached 100, the lot fell on the camels. 'Abdul-Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib confirmed this by repeating the test three times. Then the camels were sacrificed, and Abdullah was spared.:\u200a66\u201368\n\nFamily\nWives\nAbd al-Muttalib had six known wives.\n\nSumra bint Jundab of the Hawazin tribe.\nLubn\u0101 bint H\u0101jar of the Khuza'a tribe.\nFatima bint Amr of the Makhzum clan of the Quraysh tribe.\nHalah bint Wuhayb of the Zuhrah clan of the Quraysh tribe.\nNat\u012bla bint Janab of the Namir tribe.\nMumanna'a bint Amr of the Khuza'a tribe.\n\nChildren\nAccording to Ibn Hisham, \u02bfAbd al-Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib had ten sons and six daughters.:\u200a707\u2013708 note 97\u200a However, Ibn Sa'd lists twelve sons.:\u200a99\u2013101\u200aBy Sumra bint Jundab:\n\nAl-\u1e24\u0101rith.:\u200a708\u200a He was the firstborn and he died before his father.:\u200a99\u200a\nQuthum.:\u200a100\u200a He is not listed by Ibn Hisham.By Fatima bint Amr:\n\nAl-Zubayr.:\u200a707\u200a He was a poet and a chief; his father made a will in his favour.:\u200a99\u200a He died before Islam, leaving two sons and daughters.:\u200a101\u200a:\u200a34\u201335\u200a\nAbu Talib, born as Abd Manaf,:\u200a99\u200a:\u200a707\u200a father of the future Caliph Ali.

After working with various dog, pony and other animal shows, he entered the vaudeville circuit as a comedian. This led to him entering the film industry working on the Keystone Cops series of films making various short comedies.Kenton began as a writer for Mack Sennett in 1914 and would direct feature films for Columbia Pictures,  Tiffany Pictures, Paramount Pictures, RKO Pictures, Republic Pictures.

He was the director of the Peabody Essex Museum in Salem for 17 months, resigning December 31, 2020. He was the director of the Toledo Museum of Art in Ohio from 2010 to 2019. He was the director of the Hood Museum of Art from 2005 to 2010, and the National Gallery of Australia (Canberra) from 1997 to 2004.\n\nCareer\nBrian Kennedy currently lives and works in the United States after leaving Australia in 2005 to direct the Hood Museum of Art at Dartmouth College. In October 2010 he became the ninth Director of the Toledo Museum of Art. On 1 July 2019, he succeeded Dan Monroe as the executive director and CEO of the Peabody Essex Museum.\n\nEarly life and career in Ireland\nKennedy was born in Dublin and attended Clonkeen College. He received B.A. (1982), M.A. (1985) and PhD (1989) degrees from University College-Dublin, where he studied both art history and history.\nHe worked in the Irish Department of Education (1982), the European Commission, Brussels (1983), and in Ireland at the Chester Beatty Library (1983\u201385), Government Publications Office (1985\u201386), and Department of Finance (1986\u201389). He married Mary Fiona Carlin in 1988.He was Assistant Director at the National Gallery of Ireland in Dublin from 1989 to 1997. He was Chair of the Irish Association of Art Historians from 1996 to 1997, and of the Council of Australian Art Museum Directors from 2001 to 2003. In September 1997 he became Director of the National Gallery of Australia.\n\nNational Gallery of Australia (NGA)\nKennedy expanded the traveling exhibitions and loans program throughout Australia, arranged for several major shows of Australian art abroad, increased the number of exhibitions at the museum itself and oversaw the development of an extensive multi-media site.  Although he oversaw several years of the museum's highest ever annual visitation, he discontinued the emphasis of his predecessor, Betty Churcher, on showing \"blockbuster\" exhibitions.\nDuring his directorship, the NGA gained government support for improving the building and significant private donations and corporate sponsorship. However, the initial design for the building proved controversial generating a public dispute with the original architect on moral rights grounds.  As a result, the project was not delivered during Dr Kennedy's tenure, with a significantly altered design completed some years later.  Private funding supported two acquisitions of British art, including David Hockney's A Bigger Grand Canyon in 1999, and Lucian Freud's After C\u00e9zanne in 2001. Kennedy built on the established collections at the museum by acquiring the Holmgren-Spertus collection of Indonesian textiles; the Kenneth Tyler collection of editioned prints, screens, multiples and unique proofs; and the Australian Print Workshop Archive. He was also notable for campaigning for the construction of a new \"front\" entrance to the Gallery, facing King Edward Terrace, which was completed in 2010 (see reference to the building project above).\nKennedy's cancellation of the \"Sensation exhibition\" (scheduled at the NGA from 2 June 2000 to 13 August 2000) was controversial, and seen by some as censorship. He claimed that the decision was due to the exhibition being \"too close to the market\" implying that a national cultural institution cannot exhibit the private collection of a speculative art investor. However, there were other exhibitions at the NGA during his tenure, which could have raised similar concerns. The exhibition featured the privately owned Young British Artists works belonging to Charles Saatchi and attracted large attendances in London and Brooklyn. Its most controversial work was Chris Ofili's The Holy Virgin Mary, a painting which used elephant dung and was accused of being blasphemous. The then-mayor of New York, Rudolph Giuliani, campaigned against the exhibition, claiming it was \"Catholic-bashing\" and an \"aggressive, vicious, disgusting attack on religion.\" In November 1999, Kennedy cancelled the exhibition and stated that the events in New York had \"obscured discussion of the artistic merit of the works of art\". He has said that it \"was the toughest decision of my professional life, so far.\"Kennedy was also repeatedly questioned on his management of a range of issues during the Australian Government's Senate Estimates process - particularly on the NGA's occupational health and safety record and concerns about the NGA's twenty-year-old air-conditioning system. The air-conditioning was finally renovated in 2003. Kennedy announced in 2002 that he would not seek extension of his contract beyond 2004, accepting a seven-year term as had his two predecessors.He became a joint Irish-Australian citizen in 2003.\n\nToledo Museum of Art\nThe Toledo Museum of Art is known for its exceptional collections of European and American paintings and sculpture, glass, antiquities, artist books, Japanese prints and netsuke. The museum offers free admission and is recognized for its historical leadership in the field of art education.  During his tenure, Kennedy has focused the museum's art education efforts on visual literacy, which he defines as \"learning to read, understand and write visual language.\"   Initiatives have included baby and toddler tours, specialized training for all staff, docents, volunteers and the launch of a website, www.vislit.org. In November 2014, the museum hosted the International Visual Literacy Association (IVLA) conference, the first Museum to do so. Kennedy has been a frequent speaker on the topic, including 2010 and 2013 TEDx talks on visual and sensory literacy.\nKennedy has expressed an interest in expanding the museum's collection of contemporary art and art by indigenous peoples. Works by Frank Stella, Sean Scully, Jaume Plensa, Ravinder Reddy and Mary Sibande have been acquired.  In addition, the museum has made major acquisitions of Old Master paintings by Frans Hals and Luca Giordano.During his tenure the Toledo Museum of Art has announced the return of several objects from its collection due to claims the objects were stolen and/or illegally exported prior being sold to the museum.  In 2011 a Meissen sweetmeat stand was returned to Germany followed by an Etruscan Kalpis or water jug to Italy (2013), an Indian sculpture of Ganesha (2014) and an astrological compendium to Germany in 2015.\n\nHood Museum of Art\nKennedy became Director of the Hood Museum of Art in July 2005. During his tenure, he implemented a series of large and small-scale exhibitions and oversaw the production of more than 20 publications to bring greater public attention to the museum's remarkable collections of the arts of America, Europe, Africa, Papua New Guinea and the Polar regions. At 70,000 objects, the Hood has one of the largest collections on any American college of university campus. The exhibition, Black Womanhood: Images, Icons, and Ideologies of the African Body, toured several US venues. Kennedy increased campus curricular use of works of art, with thousands of objects pulled from storage for classes annually. Numerous acquisitions were made with the museum's generous endowments, and he curated several exhibitions: including Wenda Gu: Forest of Stone Steles: Retranslation and Rewriting Tang Dynasty Poetry, Sean Scully: The Art of the Stripe, and Frank Stella: Irregular Polygons.\n\nPublications\nKennedy has written or edited a number of books on art, including:\n\nAlfred Chester Beatty and Ireland 1950-1968: A study in cultural politics, Glendale Press (1988), ISBN 978-0-907606-49-9\nDreams and responsibilities: The state and arts in independent Ireland, Arts Council of Ireland (1990), ISBN 978-0-906627-32-7\nJack B Yeats: Jack Butler Yeats, 1871-1957 (Lives of Irish Artists), Unipub (October 1991), ISBN 978-0-948524-24-0\nThe Anatomy Lesson: Art and Medicine (with Davis Coakley), National Gallery of Ireland (January 1992), ISBN 978-0-903162-65-4\nIreland: Art into History (with Raymond Gillespie), Roberts Rinehart Publishers (1994), ISBN 978-1-57098-005-3\nIrish Painting, Roberts Rinehart Publishers (November 1997),  ISBN 978-1-86059-059-7\nSean Scully: The Art of the Stripe, Hood Museum of Art (October 2008), ISBN 978-0-944722-34-3\nFrank Stella: Irregular Polygons, 1965-1966, Hood Museum of Art (October 2010), ISBN 978-0-944722-39-8\n\nHonors and achievements\nKennedy was awarded the Australian Centenary Medal in 2001 for service to Australian Society and its art. He is a trustee and treasurer of the Association of Art Museum Directors, a peer reviewer for the American Association of Museums and a member of the International Association of Art Critics. In 2013 he was appointed inaugural eminent professor at the University of Toledo and received an honorary doctorate from Lourdes University.

He received B.A. (1982), M.A. (1985) and PhD (1989) degrees from University College-Dublin, where he studied both art history and history.\nHe worked in the Irish Department of Education (1982), the European Commission, Brussels (1983), and in Ireland at the Chester Beatty Library (1983\u201385), Government Publications Office (1985\u201386), and Department of Finance (1986\u201389). He married Mary Fiona Carlin in 1988.He was Assistant Director at the National Gallery of Ireland in Dublin from 1989 to 1997. He was Chair of the Irish Association of Art Historians from 1996 to 1997, and of the Council of Australian Art Museum Directors from 2001 to 2003. In September 1997 he became Director of the National Gallery of Australia.\n\nNational Gallery of Australia (NGA)\nKennedy expanded the traveling exhibitions and loans program throughout Australia, arranged for several major shows of Australian art abroad, increased the number of exhibitions at the museum itself and oversaw the development of an extensive multi-media site.  Although he oversaw several years of the museum's highest ever annual visitation, he discontinued the emphasis of his predecessor, Betty Churcher, on showing \"blockbuster\" exhibitions.\nDuring his directorship, the NGA gained government support for improving the building and significant private donations and corporate sponsorship. However, the initial design for the building proved controversial generating a public dispute with the original architect on moral rights grounds.  As a result, the project was not delivered during Dr Kennedy's tenure, with a significantly altered design completed some years later.  Private funding supported two acquisitions of British art, including David Hockney's A Bigger Grand Canyon in 1999, and Lucian Freud's After C\u00e9zanne in 2001. Kennedy built on the established collections at the museum by acquiring the Holmgren-Spertus collection of Indonesian textiles; the Kenneth Tyler collection of editioned prints, screens, multiples and unique proofs; and the Australian Print Workshop Archive. He was also notable for campaigning for the construction of a new \"front\" entrance to the Gallery, facing King Edward Terrace, which was completed in 2010 (see reference to the building project above).\nKennedy's cancellation of the \"Sensation exhibition\" (scheduled at the NGA from 2 June 2000 to 13 August 2000) was controversial, and seen by some as censorship. He claimed that the decision was due to the exhibition being \"too close to the market\" implying that a national cultural institution cannot exhibit the private collection of a speculative art investor. However, there were other exhibitions at the NGA during his tenure, which could have raised similar concerns. The exhibition featured the privately owned Young British Artists works belonging to Charles Saatchi and attracted large attendances in London and Brooklyn. Its most controversial work was Chris Ofili's The Holy Virgin Mary, a painting which used elephant dung and was accused of being blasphemous. The then-mayor of New York, Rudolph Giuliani, campaigned against the exhibition, claiming it was \"Catholic-bashing\" and an \"aggressive, vicious, disgusting attack on religion.\" In November 1999, Kennedy cancelled the exhibition and stated that the events in New York had \"obscured discussion of the artistic merit of the works of art\". He has said that it \"was the toughest decision of my professional life, so far.\"Kennedy was also repeatedly questioned on his management of a range of issues during the Australian Government's Senate Estimates process - particularly on the NGA's occupational health and safety record and concerns about the NGA's twenty-year-old air-conditioning system. The air-conditioning was finally renovated in 2003. Kennedy announced in 2002 that he would not seek extension of his contract beyond 2004, accepting a seven-year term as had his two predecessors.He became a joint Irish-Australian citizen in 2003.\n\nToledo Museum of Art\nThe Toledo Museum of Art is known for its exceptional collections of European and American paintings and sculpture, glass, antiquities, artist books, Japanese prints and netsuke. The museum offers free admission and is recognized for its historical leadership in the field of art education.  During his tenure, Kennedy has focused the museum's art education efforts on visual literacy, which he defines as \"learning to read, understand and write visual language.\"   Initiatives have included baby and toddler tours, specialized training for all staff, docents, volunteers and the launch of a website, www.vislit.org. In November 2014, the museum hosted the International Visual Literacy Association (IVLA) conference, the first Museum to do so. Kennedy has been a frequent speaker on the topic, including 2010 and 2013 TEDx talks on visual and sensory literacy.\nKennedy has expressed an interest in expanding the museum's collection of contemporary art and art by indigenous peoples. Works by Frank Stella, Sean Scully, Jaume Plensa, Ravinder Reddy and Mary Sibande have been acquired.  In addition, the museum has made major acquisitions of Old Master paintings by Frans Hals and Luca Giordano.During his tenure the Toledo Museum of Art has announced the return of several objects from its collection due to claims the objects were stolen and/or illegally exported prior being sold to the museum.  In 2011 a Meissen sweetmeat stand was returned to Germany followed by an Etruscan Kalpis or water jug to Italy (2013), an Indian sculpture of Ganesha (2014) and an astrological compendium to Germany in 2015.\n\nHood Museum of Art\nKennedy became Director of the Hood Museum of Art in July 2005. During his tenure, he implemented a series of large and small-scale exhibitions and oversaw the production of more than 20 publications to bring greater public attention to the museum's remarkable collections of the arts of America, Europe, Africa, Papua New Guinea and the Polar regions. At 70,000 objects, the Hood has one of the largest collections on any American college of university campus. The exhibition, Black Womanhood: Images, Icons, and Ideologies of the African Body, toured several US venues. Kennedy increased campus curricular use of works of art, with thousands of objects pulled from storage for classes annually. Numerous acquisitions were made with the museum's generous endowments, and he curated several exhibitions: including Wenda Gu: Forest of Stone Steles: Retranslation and Rewriting Tang Dynasty Poetry, Sean Scully: The Art of the Stripe, and Frank Stella: Irregular Polygons.\n\nPublications\nKennedy has written or edited a number of books on art, including:\n\nAlfred Chester Beatty and Ireland 1950-1968: A study in cultural politics, Glendale Press (1988), ISBN 978-0-907606-49-9\nDreams and responsibilities: The state and arts in independent Ireland, Arts Council of Ireland (1990), ISBN 978-0-906627-32-7\nJack B Yeats: Jack Butler Yeats, 1871-1957 (Lives of Irish Artists), Unipub (October 1991), ISBN 978-0-948524-24-0\nThe Anatomy Lesson: Art and Medicine (with Davis Coakley), National Gallery of Ireland (January 1992), ISBN 978-0-903162-65-4\nIreland: Art into History (with Raymond Gillespie), Roberts Rinehart Publishers (1994), ISBN 978-1-57098-005-3\nIrish Painting, Roberts Rinehart Publishers (November 1997),  ISBN 978-1-86059-059-7\nSean Scully: The Art of the Stripe, Hood Museum of Art (October 2008), ISBN 978-0-944722-34-3\nFrank Stella: Irregular Polygons, 1965-1966, Hood Museum of Art (October 2010), ISBN 978-0-944722-39-8\n\nHonors and achievements\nKennedy was awarded the Australian Centenary Medal in 2001 for service to Australian Society and its art. He is a trustee and treasurer of the Association of Art Museum Directors, a peer reviewer for the American Association of Museums and a member of the International Association of Art Critics. In 2013 he was appointed inaugural eminent professor at the University of Toledo and received an honorary doctorate from Lourdes University. Most recently, Kennedy received the 2014 Northwest Region, Ohio Art Education Association award for distinguished educator for art education.\n\n\n== Notes ==\nPassage 7:\nIan Barry (director)\nIan Barry is an Australian director of film and TV.\n\nSelect credits\nWaiting for Lucas (1973) (short)\nStone (1974) (editor only)\nThe Chain Reaction (1980)\nWhose Baby?

Prior to his current position, Govan worked as the director of the Dia Art Foundation in New York City.\n\nEarly life and education\nGovan was born in 1963 in North Adams, Massachusetts, and was raised in the Washington D.C. area, attending Sidwell Friends School.He majored in art history and fine arts at Williams College, where he met Thomas Krens, who was then director of the Williams College Museum of Art. Govan became closely involved with the museum, serving as acting curator as an undergraduate. After receiving his B.A. from Williams in 1985, Govan began an MFA in fine arts from the University of California, San Diego.\n\nCareer\nAs a twenty-five year old graduate student, Govan was recruited by his former mentor at Williams, Thomas Krens, who in 1988 had been appointed director of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation. Govan served as deputy director of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum under Krens from 1988 to 1994, a period that culminated in the construction and opening of the Frank Gehry designed Guggenheim branch in Bilbao, Spain. Govan supervised the reinstallation of the museum's permanent collection galleries after its extensive renovation.\n\nDia Art Foundation\nFrom 1994 to 2006, Govan was president and director of Dia Art Foundation in New York City. There, he spearheaded the conversion of a Nabisco box factory into the 300,000 square foot Dia:Beacon in New York's Hudson Valley, which houses Dia's collection of art from the 1960s to the present. Built in a former Nabisco box factory, the critically acclaimed museum has been credited with catalyzing a cultural and economic revival within the formerly factory-based city of Beacon. Dia's collection nearly doubled in size during Govan's tenure, but he also came under criticism for \"needlessly and permanently\" closing Dia's West 22nd Street building. During his time at Dia, Govan also worked closely with artists James Turrell and Michael Heizer, becoming an ardent supporter of Roden Crater and City, the artists' respective site-specific land art projects under construction in the American southwest. Govan successfully lobbied Washington to have the 704,000 acres in central Nevada surrounding City declared a national monument in 2015.\n\nLACMA\nIn February 2006, a search committee composed of eleven LACMA trustees, led by the late Nancy M. Daly, recruited Govan to run the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. Govan has stated that he was drawn to the role not only because of LACMA's geographical distance from its European and east coast peers, but also because of the museum's relative youth, having been established in 1961. \"I felt that because of this newness I had the opportunity to reconsider the museum,\" Govan has written, \"[and] Los Angeles is a good place to do that.\"Govan has been widely regarded for transforming LACMA into both a local and international landmark. Since Govan's arrival, LACMA has acquired by donation or purchase over 27,000 works for the permanent collection, and the museum's gallery space has almost doubled thanks to the addition of two new buildings designed by Renzo Piano, the Broad Contemporary Art Museum (BCAM) and the Lynda and Stewart Resnick Pavilion. LACMA's annual attendance has grown from 600,000 to nearly 1.6 million in 2016.\n\nArtist collaborations\nSince his arrival, Govan has commissioned exhibition scenography and gallery designs in collaboration with artists. In 2006, for example, Govan invited LA artist John Baldessari to design an upcoming exhibition about the Belgian surrealist Ren\u00e9 Magritte, resulting in a theatrical show that reflected the twisted perspective of the latter's topsy-turvy world. Baldessari has also designed LACMA's logo. Since then, Govan has also commissioned Cuban-American artist Jorge Pardo to design LACMA's Art of the Ancient Americas gallery, described in the Los Angeles Times as a \"gritty cavern deep inside the earth ... crossed with a high-style urban lounge.\"Govan has also commissioned several large-scale public artworks for LACMA's campus from contemporary California artists. These include Chris Burden's Urban Light (2008), a series of 202 vintage street lamps from different neighborhoods in Los Angeles, arranged in front of the entrance pavilion, Barbara Kruger's Untitled (Shafted) (2008), Robert Irwin's Primal Palm Garden (2010), and Michael Heizer's Levitated Mass, a 340-ton boulder transported 100 miles from the Jurupa Valley to LACMA, a widely publicized journey that culminated with a large celebration on Wilshire Boulevard. Thanks in part to the popularity of these public artworks, LACMA was ranked the fourth most instagrammed museum in the world in 2016.In his first three full years, the museum raised $251 million\u2014about $100 million more than it collected during the three years before he arrived. In 2010, it was announced that Govan will steer LACMA for at least six more years. In a letter dated February 24, 2013, Govan, along with the LACMA board's co-chairmen Terry Semel and Andrew Gordon, proposed a merger with the financially troubled Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles and a plan to raise $100 million for the combined museum.\n\nZumthor Project\nGovan's latest project is an ambitious building project, the replacement of four of the campus's aging buildings with a single new state of the art gallery building designed by architect Peter Zumthor. As of January 2017, he has raised about $300 million in commitments. Construction is expected to begin in 2018, and the new building will open in 2023, to coincide with the opening of the new D Line metro stop on Wilshire Boulevard. The project also envisages dissolving all existing curatorial departments and departmental collections. Some commentators have been highly critical of Govan's plans. Joseph Giovannini, recalling Govan's technically unrealizable onetime plan to hang Jeff Koons' Train sculpture from the facade of the Ahmanson Gallery, has accused Govan of \"driving the institution over a cliff into an equivalent mid-air wreck of its own\". Describing the collection merging proposal as the creation of a \"giant raffle bowl of some 130,000 objects\", Giovannini also points out that the Zumthor building will contain 33% less gallery space than the galleries it will replace, and that the linear footage of wall space available for displays will decrease by about 7,500 ft, or 1.5 miles. Faced with losing a building named in its honor, and anticipating that its acquisitions could no longer be displayed, the Ahmanson Foundation withdrew its support.\nOn the merging of the separate curatorial divisions to create a non-departmental art museum, Christopher Knight has pointed out that \"no other museum of LACMA's size and complexity does it\" that way, and characterized the museum's 2019 \"To Rome and Back\" exhibition, the first to take place under the new scheme, as \"bland and ineffectual\" and an \"unsuccessful sample of what's to come\".\n\nPersonal life\nGovan is married and has two daughters, one from a previous marriage. He and his family used to live in a $6 million mansion in Hancock Park that was provided by LACMA - a benefit worth $155,000 a year, according to most recent tax filings - until LACMA decided that it would sell the property to make up for the museum's of almost $900 million in debt [2].

Prior to his current position, Govan worked as the director of the Dia Art Foundation in New York City.\n\nEarly life and education\nGovan was born in 1963 in North Adams, Massachusetts, and was raised in the Washington D.C. area, attending Sidwell Friends School.He majored in art history and fine arts at Williams College, where he met Thomas Krens, who was then director of the Williams College Museum of Art. Govan became closely involved with the museum, serving as acting curator as an undergraduate. After receiving his B.A. from Williams in 1985, Govan began an MFA in fine arts from the University of California, San Diego.\n\nCareer\nAs a twenty-five year old graduate student, Govan was recruited by his former mentor at Williams, Thomas Krens, who in 1988 had been appointed director of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation. Govan served as deputy director of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum under Krens from 1988 to 1994, a period that culminated in the construction and opening of the Frank Gehry designed Guggenheim branch in Bilbao, Spain. Govan supervised the reinstallation of the museum's permanent collection galleries after its extensive renovation.\n\nDia Art Foundation\nFrom 1994 to 2006, Govan was president and director of Dia Art Foundation in New York City. There, he spearheaded the conversion of a Nabisco box factory into the 300,000 square foot Dia:Beacon in New York's Hudson Valley, which houses Dia's collection of art from the 1960s to the present. Built in a former Nabisco box factory, the critically acclaimed museum has been credited with catalyzing a cultural and economic revival within the formerly factory-based city of Beacon. Dia's collection nearly doubled in size during Govan's tenure, but he also came under criticism for \"needlessly and permanently\" closing Dia's West 22nd Street building. During his time at Dia, Govan also worked closely with artists James Turrell and Michael Heizer, becoming an ardent supporter of Roden Crater and City, the artists' respective site-specific land art projects under construction in the American southwest. Govan successfully lobbied Washington to have the 704,000 acres in central Nevada surrounding City declared a national monument in 2015.\n\nLACMA\nIn February 2006, a search committee composed of eleven LACMA trustees, led by the late Nancy M. Daly, recruited Govan to run the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. Govan has stated that he was drawn to the role not only because of LACMA's geographical distance from its European and east coast peers, but also because of the museum's relative youth, having been established in 1961. \"I felt that because of this newness I had the opportunity to reconsider the museum,\" Govan has written, \"[and] Los Angeles is a good place to do that.\"Govan has been widely regarded for transforming LACMA into both a local and international landmark. Since Govan's arrival, LACMA has acquired by donation or purchase over 27,000 works for the permanent collection, and the museum's gallery space has almost doubled thanks to the addition of two new buildings designed by Renzo Piano, the Broad Contemporary Art Museum (BCAM) and the Lynda and Stewart Resnick Pavilion. LACMA's annual attendance has grown from 600,000 to nearly 1.6 million in 2016.\n\nArtist collaborations\nSince his arrival, Govan has commissioned exhibition scenography and gallery designs in collaboration with artists. In 2006, for example, Govan invited LA artist John Baldessari to design an upcoming exhibition about the Belgian surrealist Ren\u00e9 Magritte, resulting in a theatrical show that reflected the twisted perspective of the latter's topsy-turvy world. Baldessari has also designed LACMA's logo. Since then, Govan has also commissioned Cuban-American artist Jorge Pardo to design LACMA's Art of the Ancient Americas gallery, described in the Los Angeles Times as a \"gritty cavern deep inside the earth ... crossed with a high-style urban lounge.\"Govan has also commissioned several large-scale public artworks for LACMA's campus from contemporary California artists. These include Chris Burden's Urban Light (2008), a series of 202 vintage street lamps from different neighborhoods in Los Angeles, arranged in front of the entrance pavilion, Barbara Kruger's Untitled (Shafted) (2008), Robert Irwin's Primal Palm Garden (2010), and Michael Heizer's Levitated Mass, a 340-ton boulder transported 100 miles from the Jurupa Valley to LACMA, a widely publicized journey that culminated with a large celebration on Wilshire Boulevard. Thanks in part to the popularity of these public artworks, LACMA was ranked the fourth most instagrammed museum in the world in 2016.In his first three full years, the museum raised $251 million\u2014about $100 million more than it collected during the three years before he arrived. In 2010, it was announced that Govan will steer LACMA for at least six more years. In a letter dated February 24, 2013, Govan, along with the LACMA board's co-chairmen Terry Semel and Andrew Gordon, proposed a merger with the financially troubled Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles and a plan to raise $100 million for the combined museum.\n\nZumthor Project\nGovan's latest project is an ambitious building project, the replacement of four of the campus's aging buildings with a single new state of the art gallery building designed by architect Peter Zumthor. As of January 2017, he has raised about $300 million in commitments. Construction is expected to begin in 2018, and the new building will open in 2023, to coincide with the opening of the new D Line metro stop on Wilshire Boulevard. The project also envisages dissolving all existing curatorial departments and departmental collections. Some commentators have been highly critical of Govan's plans. Joseph Giovannini, recalling Govan's technically unrealizable onetime plan to hang Jeff Koons' Train sculpture from the facade of the Ahmanson Gallery, has accused Govan of \"driving the institution over a cliff into an equivalent mid-air wreck of its own\". Describing the collection merging proposal as the creation of a \"giant raffle bowl of some 130,000 objects\", Giovannini also points out that the Zumthor building will contain 33% less gallery space than the galleries it will replace, and that the linear footage of wall space available for displays will decrease by about 7,500 ft, or 1.5 miles. Faced with losing a building named in its honor, and anticipating that its acquisitions could no longer be displayed, the Ahmanson Foundation withdrew its support.\nOn the merging of the separate curatorial divisions to create a non-departmental art museum, Christopher Knight has pointed out that \"no other museum of LACMA's size and complexity does it\" that way, and characterized the museum's 2019 \"To Rome and Back\" exhibition, the first to take place under the new scheme, as \"bland and ineffectual\" and an \"unsuccessful sample of what's to come\".\n\nPersonal life\nGovan is married and has two daughters, one from a previous marriage.

Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\nJane Wigham\nJane Wigham (n\u00e9e Smeal; 1801\u20131888) was a leading Scottish abolitionist, and was the secretary of the Glasgow Ladies' Emancipation Society.\n\nLife\nSmeal was born in Glasgow in 1801, the sister of William Smeal. She was educated as a Quaker at Ackworth School in Yorkshire. The family resided in Edinburgh, later moving to Aberdeen. As Quakers, Smeal's family were unusual in Scotland. The 1851 census shows that there were fewer than 400 active Scottish Quakers at the time.Smeal became the leader and secretary of the radical Glasgow Ladies Emancipation Society. Her brother William in 1822 founded the Glasgow Anti-Slavery Society, a forerunner of the Glasgow Emancipation Society, and was later active in the latter. Smeal had a record of anti-slavery activity, long before the Free Church became involved in the issue.\nIn 1838 she published an important pamphlet with Elizabeth Pease of Darlington titled Address to the Women of Great Britain. This document called for British women to speak in public and to form anti-slavery organisations for women. An address that Smeal prepared for Queen Victoria has been credited with being the \"final blow\" that ended slavery in the Caribbean.In 1840 Smeal became the second wife of the Quaker John Wigham, who was a tea merchant and active abolitionist in Glasgow. In 1830, Wigham's wife and two of their children died however the family was revitalized when he married Smeal. Jane Smeal became Jane Wigham and she formed a close friendship and collaboration with her stepdaughter, Eliza Wigham. Smeal and Wigham's marriage took place in the same year as the World's Anti-Slavery Convention in London, where Eliza was one of the delegates.After the Ladies' Emancipation Society ceased activity, Jane and Eliza, along with some of their friends, set up the Edinburgh chapter of the National Society of Women's Suffrage. Priscilla Bright McLaren, the president, Elizabeth Pease, the treasurer, and McLaren's daughter Agnes McLaren joined Eliza as joint secretaries. Despite a lack of support from her husband John, Jane and her stepdaughter established the Edinburgh society as one of the leading British groups supporting the controversial views of the American abolitionist and social reformer William Lloyd Garrison.John Wigham died in 1864 and Eliza remained on at the family home on South Gray Street in Edinburgh to care for her stepmother. Jane died in November 1888 after a prolonged illness.\n\nLegacy\nFour of the women associated with Edinburgh in the 19th century were the subject of a campaign by Edinburgh historians in 2015. The group aimed to gain recognition for Elizabeth Pease Nichol, Priscilla Bright McLaren, Eliza Wigham, and Jane Smeal \u2013 the city's \"forgotten heroines\".\nPassage 2:\nAngelo I Gozzadini\nAngelo I Gozzadini (died between 1468 and 1476) was Lord of Kythnos.\nHe married in 1429 Caterina Crispo (born 1415, date of death unknown), daughter of Nicholas Crispo, Lord of Syros and sister of Francesco II, sixteenth Duke of the Archipelago.\nPassage 3:\nMay Green Hinckley\nMay Green Hinckley (May 1, 1881 \u2013 May 2, 1943) was the third Primary general president of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) from 1940 until her death. She was the stepmother of Gordon B. Hinckley, fifteenth president of the LDS Church.\n\nBiography\nGreen was born in Brampton, Derbyshire, England. Her mother had joined the LDS Church three years before Green's birth, but her father never joined. She emigrated to the United States with her mother and some of her siblings in 1889. Green was baptized into the LDS Church in 1891, and was by then living in Salt Lake City.Green was raised in the church's Salt Lake 5th Ward. Early on she was a teacher in both the Sunday School and the Young Women Mutual Improvement Association (YWMIA). She served as a missionary for the church in the Central States Mission from 1907 to 1909.\nAfter studying booking and accounting, Green began work as business manager for a Salt Lake medical clinic.In 1920, Green was made president of the YLMIA of the Granite Stake in Salt Lake City. She served in this position for the next 12 years, and oversaw the initial establishment of the Gleaner program.In 1932, at the age of 50, Green married Bryant S. Hinckley, whose wife, Ada, had died in 1930. At the time, five of Hinckley's 13 children were still living at home. At that time, Green was president of the stake YWMIA. One of the children, Gordon B. Hinckley, later recalled that he and the other children were upset by their father's decision to remarry, but they eventually came to accept their stepmother: \"I don't know that it was easy for her to step into our family, but she did it well. We all respected her. We all loved her\". In 1935, when Bryant Hinckley became president of the Northern States Mission based in Chicago, May Hinckley went with him and presided over the Primary Association, YWMIA, and Relief Society within the mission.\nIn 1940, May Hinckley was asked by church president Heber J. Grant to succeed May Anderson and become the third general president of the church's Primary Association. In her 3+1\u20442-year tenure, Hinckley introduced a revised curriculum, added a scripture-reading program for leaders and teachers, established a formal scriptural theme for Primary, and selected the official Primary logo, motto and colors.\nHinckley formed a committee that created lessons for use by Primaries in missions (as opposed to stakes). With energy rationing as a result of World War II, she oversaw the creation of more home-based Primary programs.Hinckley was the editor of The Children's Friend while she was the Primary General President. Her term ended when she unexpectedly died of pneumonia in Salt Lake City, Utah, the day after her 62nd birthday. She was succeeded by Adele C. Howells, her first counselor.\n\nSee also\nLaVern W.

He was Lord of Milos, thus a vassal to the Duke of Naxos, as well as his cousin through his marriage to Fiorenza Sanudo, a grand-daughter of the Duke Guglielmo Sanudo. Crispo might also have been a pirate. He was sent by the Republic of Venice to Naxos in March 1383 for concern that the then Duke Niccol\u00f2 III dalle Carceri was incompetent. The Republic suffered from predation by the Ottoman Empire in the Aegean.On the island, a hunt was suggested.

In a letter dated 1426 Crispo says he was married to the daughter of Jacopo Gattilusio, lord of Lesbos. In a 1474 chronicle by the Venetian traveller Caterino Zeno it is said that he was married to an Eudoksia Valenza, of whom there is no other mention in any source. Although Zeno claims that she was a daughter of John IV of Trebizond, this has been disproved by historiographical research, which has shown that John had an only daughter, Theodora Despina (married to Uzun Hassan of Ak Koyunlu). Alternative identities have been proposed for Valenza: whether it was the name of Gattilusio's daughter, whether she was a daughter of Alexios IV of Trebizond or whether she was a Genoese woman.\n\nCaterina Crispo, married in 1429 Angelo I Gozzadini, Lord of Kythnos (- 1468/76)\nLucrezia Crispo, married Nobil Huomo Leone Malipiero, Patrizio Veneto\nFrancesco II Crispo\nPetronilla Crispo, married in 1437 Nobil Huomo Jacopo Priuli, Patrizio Veneto\nMaria Crispo, married Nobil Huomo Nicolo Balbi, Patrizio Veneto\nFiorenza Crispo (\u20131501), married in 1444 Nobil Huomo Marco Cornaro, Cavaliere del Sacro Romano Impero, Patrizio Veneto (Venice, December 1406 \u2013 Venice, 1 August 1479), and had:\nGiorgio Cornaro\nCatherine Cornaro\nValenza Crispo, married Nobil Huomo Giovanni Loredan, Patrizio Veneto\nMarco Crispo, Knight of the Knights Hospitaller, who had illegitimate issue\nViolante Crispo, married Nobil Huomo Caterino Zeno, Patrizio Veneto, Diplomat of the Venetian Republic, and had:\nAdriana Zeno\nPietro Zeno\nA daughter\nAnthony Crispo, Lord of Syros\nPassage 9:\nIrene Baker\nEdith Irene Bailey Baker (November 17, 1901 \u2013 April 2, 1994) was an American politician and a United States Representative from Tennessee.

Baker Jr. and Mary Elizabeth Baker, as well as  a daughter of their own, Beverly Irene Baker. She served on the Republican National Committee from 1960 to 1964.When her husband died suddenly in office on January 7, 1964, Baker ran as a Republican in the special election to fill the remainder of his term, defeating Democrat Willard Yarbrough, a Knoxville journalist. As a candidate for the seat, she promised to serve only as a caretaker who would not seek further election; and she fulfilled that promise, and served from  March 10, 1964, to January 3, 1965.  While in Congress, she served on the House Committee on Government Operations and advocated for a balanced federal budget. She also championed coal mining interests, the TVA, U.S. Atomic Energy Commission programs in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, and cost of living increases in Social Security pensions.

She was educated as a Quaker at Ackworth School in Yorkshire. The family resided in Edinburgh, later moving to Aberdeen. As Quakers, Smeal's family were unusual in Scotland. The 1851 census shows that there were fewer than 400 active Scottish Quakers at the time.Smeal became the leader and secretary of the radical Glasgow Ladies Emancipation Society. Her brother William in 1822 founded the Glasgow Anti-Slavery Society, a forerunner of the Glasgow Emancipation Society, and was later active in the latter. Smeal had a record of anti-slavery activity, long before the Free Church became involved in the issue.\nIn 1838 she published an important pamphlet with Elizabeth Pease of Darlington titled Address to the Women of Great Britain. This document called for British women to speak in public and to form anti-slavery organisations for women. An address that Smeal prepared for Queen Victoria has been credited with being the \"final blow\" that ended slavery in the Caribbean.In 1840 Smeal became the second wife of the Quaker John Wigham, who was a tea merchant and active abolitionist in Glasgow. In 1830, Wigham's wife and two of their children died however the family was revitalized when he married Smeal. Jane Smeal became Jane Wigham and she formed a close friendship and collaboration with her stepdaughter, Eliza Wigham. Smeal and Wigham's marriage took place in the same year as the World's Anti-Slavery Convention in London, where Eliza was one of the delegates.After the Ladies' Emancipation Society ceased activity, Jane and Eliza, along with some of their friends, set up the Edinburgh chapter of the National Society of Women's Suffrage. Priscilla Bright McLaren, the president, Elizabeth Pease, the treasurer, and McLaren's daughter Agnes McLaren joined Eliza as joint secretaries. Despite a lack of support from her husband John, Jane and her stepdaughter established the Edinburgh society as one of the leading British groups supporting the controversial views of the American abolitionist and social reformer William Lloyd Garrison.John Wigham died in 1864 and Eliza remained on at the family home on South Gray Street in Edinburgh to care for her stepmother. Jane died in November 1888 after a prolonged illness.\n\nLegacy\nFour of the women associated with Edinburgh in the 19th century were the subject of a campaign by Edinburgh historians in 2015. The group aimed to gain recognition for Elizabeth Pease Nichol, Priscilla Bright McLaren, Eliza Wigham, and Jane Smeal \u2013 the city's \"forgotten heroines\".\nPassage 2:\nAngelo I Gozzadini\nAngelo I Gozzadini (died between 1468 and 1476) was Lord of Kythnos.\nHe married in 1429 Caterina Crispo (born 1415, date of death unknown), daughter of Nicholas Crispo, Lord of Syros and sister of Francesco II, sixteenth Duke of the Archipelago.\nPassage 3:\nMay Green Hinckley\nMay Green Hinckley (May 1, 1881 \u2013 May 2, 1943) was the third Primary general president of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) from 1940 until her death. She was the stepmother of Gordon B. Hinckley, fifteenth president of the LDS Church.\n\nBiography\nGreen was born in Brampton, Derbyshire, England. Her mother had joined the LDS Church three years before Green's birth, but her father never joined. She emigrated to the United States with her mother and some of her siblings in 1889. Green was baptized into the LDS Church in 1891, and was by then living in Salt Lake City.Green was raised in the church's Salt Lake 5th Ward. Early on she was a teacher in both the Sunday School and the Young Women Mutual Improvement Association (YWMIA). She served as a missionary for the church in the Central States Mission from 1907 to 1909.\nAfter studying booking and accounting, Green began work as business manager for a Salt Lake medical clinic.In 1920, Green was made president of the YLMIA of the Granite Stake in Salt Lake City. She served in this position for the next 12 years, and oversaw the initial establishment of the Gleaner program.In 1932, at the age of 50, Green married Bryant S. Hinckley, whose wife, Ada, had died in 1930. At the time, five of Hinckley's 13 children were still living at home. At that time, Green was president of the stake YWMIA. One of the children, Gordon B. Hinckley, later recalled that he and the other children were upset by their father's decision to remarry, but they eventually came to accept their stepmother: \"I don't know that it was easy for her to step into our family, but she did it well. We all respected her. We all loved her\". In 1935, when Bryant Hinckley became president of the Northern States Mission based in Chicago, May Hinckley went with him and presided over the Primary Association, YWMIA, and Relief Society within the mission.\nIn 1940, May Hinckley was asked by church president Heber J. Grant to succeed May Anderson and become the third general president of the church's Primary Association. In her 3+1\u20442-year tenure, Hinckley introduced a revised curriculum, added a scripture-reading program for leaders and teachers, established a formal scriptural theme for Primary, and selected the official Primary logo, motto and colors.\nHinckley formed a committee that created lessons for use by Primaries in missions (as opposed to stakes). With energy rationing as a result of World War II, she oversaw the creation of more home-based Primary programs.Hinckley was the editor of The Children's Friend while she was the Primary General President. Her term ended when she unexpectedly died of pneumonia in Salt Lake City, Utah, the day after her 62nd birthday. She was succeeded by Adele C. Howells, her first counselor.\n\nSee also\nLaVern W.

He was Lord of Milos, thus a vassal to the Duke of Naxos, as well as his cousin through his marriage to Fiorenza Sanudo, a grand-daughter of the Duke Guglielmo Sanudo. Crispo might also have been a pirate. He was sent by the Republic of Venice to Naxos in March 1383 for concern that the then Duke Niccol\u00f2 III dalle Carceri was incompetent. The Republic suffered from predation by the Ottoman Empire in the Aegean.On the island, a hunt was suggested.

He was a son of Francesco I Crispo, tenth Duke of the Archipelago, and wife Fiorenza I Sanudo, Lady of Milos, and brother of Dukes Giacomo I, John II and William II.\n\nMarriage and issue\nIt is not known for certain how many wives he had. In a letter dated 1426 Crispo says he was married to the daughter of Jacopo Gattilusio, lord of Lesbos. In a 1474 chronicle by the Venetian traveller Caterino Zeno it is said that he was married to an Eudoksia Valenza, of whom there is no other mention in any source. Although Zeno claims that she was a daughter of John IV of Trebizond, this has been disproved by historiographical research, which has shown that John had an only daughter, Theodora Despina (married to Uzun Hassan of Ak Koyunlu). Alternative identities have been proposed for Valenza: whether it was the name of Gattilusio's daughter, whether she was a daughter of Alexios IV of Trebizond or whether she was a Genoese woman.\n\nCaterina Crispo, married in 1429 Angelo I Gozzadini, Lord of Kythnos (- 1468/76)\nLucrezia Crispo, married Nobil Huomo Leone Malipiero, Patrizio Veneto\nFrancesco II Crispo\nPetronilla Crispo, married in 1437 Nobil Huomo Jacopo Priuli, Patrizio Veneto\nMaria Crispo, married Nobil Huomo Nicolo Balbi, Patrizio Veneto\nFiorenza Crispo (\u20131501), married in 1444 Nobil Huomo Marco Cornaro, Cavaliere del Sacro Romano Impero, Patrizio Veneto (Venice, December 1406 \u2013 Venice, 1 August 1479), and had:\nGiorgio Cornaro\nCatherine Cornaro\nValenza Crispo, married Nobil Huomo Giovanni Loredan, Patrizio Veneto\nMarco Crispo, Knight of the Knights Hospitaller, who had illegitimate issue\nViolante Crispo, married Nobil Huomo Caterino Zeno, Patrizio Veneto, Diplomat of the Venetian Republic, and had:\nAdriana Zeno\nPietro Zeno\nA daughter\nAnthony Crispo, Lord of Syros\nPassage 9:\nIrene Baker\nEdith Irene Bailey Baker (November 17, 1901 \u2013 April 2, 1994) was an American politician and a United States Representative from Tennessee.

On  September 15, 1935, she married Howard Baker Sr., who was a widower with two children. The couple raised Baker's two children from his first marriage, Howard H. Baker Jr. and Mary Elizabeth Baker, as well as  a daughter of their own, Beverly Irene Baker. She served on the Republican National Committee from 1960 to 1964.When her husband died suddenly in office on January 7, 1964, Baker ran as a Republican in the special election to fill the remainder of his term, defeating Democrat Willard Yarbrough, a Knoxville journalist. As a candidate for the seat, she promised to serve only as a caretaker who would not seek further election; and she fulfilled that promise, and served from  March 10, 1964, to January 3, 1965.  While in Congress, she served on the House Committee on Government Operations and advocated for a balanced federal budget. She also championed coal mining interests, the TVA, U.S. Atomic Energy Commission programs in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, and cost of living increases in Social Security pensions.  As one of ten Republicans from the South, she voted against the Civil Rights Act.After leaving Congress in 1965, Baker became Director of Public Welfare in Knoxville, Tennessee, a position she held until 1971.\n\nDeath\nBaker died in Loudon, Tennessee on April 2, 1994 (age 92 years, 136 days).

The installation of a Cistercian community in Orval in 1131 marked his last appearance in any proceedings.\nHe married Adelaide (Alix) (1068\u20131124), daughter of Albert III, Count of Namur and Ida of Saxony (widow of Frederick of Lower Lorraine). Their children were:\n\nIda (died before 1125), married to Godfrey I, Count of Leuven\nOda (died after 1134), married to Giselbert II, Count of Duras\nHugues, probably died young\nAlbert of Chiny (before 1131\u20131162)\nFrederick, (died after 1124), Provost at Reims from 1120\nAdalbero II of Chiny-Namur (died 26 March 1145), Bishop of Li\u00e8ge, 1135\u20131145\nEustache (died after 1156), married to a daughter of Wiger de Waremme, Avou\u00e9 of Li\u00e8ge Saint-Lambert and Hesbaye. His son Louis de Lumaine was also Avou\u00e9 of Hesbaye.Ida (also known as Ida of Namur) and Godfrey I (also known as Godfrey the Bearded, not to be confused with the uncle of his father Henry II, Godfrey) were parents of Adeliza of Louvain, wife of Henry I of England.  Oda\u2019s husband Gislebert was son of Otto, Count of Duras and therefore the grandson of Giselbert, the first Count of Looz, whose family would eventually be merged with the Counts of Chiny with the marriage of Otto's great-great granddaughter Jeanne, Countess of Chiny, with Arnold IV of Looz.\nAfter his death, Otto was succeeded as Count of Chiny by his son Albert.\nPassage 6:\nLouis II, Count of Chiny\nLouis II (died before 1066), Count of Chiny (from 1025 until his death), son of Louis I, Count of Chiny and Verdun, and Ad\u00e9la\u00efde de Saint Varme.  He left very few traces in history and nothing is known about his reign.\nLouis was married to Sophie. They had two children:\n\nArnold I, Count of Chiny\nManasses (died 1068), a monk at the Church of St. Hubert.Legend has it that Louis held hunting parties in his huge game park.  Here, Thibault of Champagne established a hermitage and found a source of holy springs, and Louis built a shrine to the spring's healing powers. The shrine became famous, with many pilgrims who came to implore the grace of Saint-Thibault. Later, monks from Calabria, Italy, founded a monastery nearby at Orval at the invitation of Louis\u2019 son Arnold.\nUpon Louis' death, his son Arnold became Count of Chiny.\nPassage 7:\nArnold VI of Rummen, Count of Loon\nArnold VI de Rumigny (died May 1373), Count of Looz and Count of Chiny (as Arnold IV) (1362\u20131364), son of William of Oreye, Lord of Rumigny (by donation of Louis IV, Count of Looz in 1331), and Jeanne de Looz, daughter of Arnold V, Count of Loon and Chiny, and, Marguerite Vianden, Lady of Perwez and Grimbergen.\nIn 1336, at the death of his uncle, Louis IV, Count of Loon and Chiny, Arnold laid claim to the estates, but without success.  Instead, the estates passed to another nephew, Thierry de Heinsberg. Finally, on January 25, 1362, he bought the rights to the counties from his cousin Godfrey, Count of Looz and Chiny.  Looz, however, was still occupied by the troops of Engelbert III of the Marck, Prince-Bishop of Liege.\nOn December 25, Arnold approached the Emperor Charles IV for his help in financing the reconquest of Looz, but he failed in that endeavor.  Without options, he sold the counties to  Wenceslaus, Duke of Luxembourg, on June 16, 1364. On September 23, 1366, he entered into a transaction with John of Arkel, Prince-Bishop of Li\u00e8ge, receiving some financial compensation for the occupation of the counties\nIn 1346, Arnold married Elizabeth of Flanders, illegitimate daughter of Louis of Flanders, Count of Nevers.  No children are recorded.\n\nSources\nArlette Laret-Kayser, Entre Bar et Luxembourg : Le Comt\u00e9 de Chiny des Origines \u00e0 1300, Bruxelles (\u00e9ditions du Cr\u00e9dit Communal, Collection Histoire, s\u00e9rie in-8\u00b0, n\u00b0 72), 1986\nPassage 8:\nArnold I, Count of Chiny\nArnold I (died 16 April 1106), Count of Chiny, son of Louis II, Count of Chiny, and his wife Sophie. He succeeded his father as count before 1066.\nArnold is best known for his many clashes with the authorities.  The only known positive action of his was the founding of the Abbey of Orval with Conrad I, Count of Luxembourg. In addition he began other religious institutions, apparently as atonement for his many crimes. He had many run-ins with the clergy, particularly with Henry, Bishop of Li\u00e8ge, a relative of Godfrey the Bearded, no doubt due to the murder of his grandfather by Godfrey\u2019s father. There were also issues with Henry's successor Otbert.\nA convenient story is that Arnold regularly confronted Godfrey\u2019s grandson Count Godfrey of Bouillon, a leader of the First Crusade and nephew of Countess Mathilda of Tuscany, but that they eventually became friends. Because of this newly-found friendship, he allegedly entrusted Godfrey with his sons Otto and Louis to take part in the crusade. The reality is that this is likely a story concocted by Count Louis V, much like the rest of his version of the history of Chiny (see the discussion in the Counts of Chiny), to enhance his standing at the Tournament of Chauvency in 1285, which included such royalty as Rudolf I, King of Germany.\nIt is clear that Otto and Louis never actually joined the crusade, as their names are not listed among the participants in the Holy quest. The reality of the situation appears that Godfrey's army included relatively few of the major nobles of the duchy, especially those of comital rank. The nobles of Lower Lotharingia were not all vassals of the Duke (and later Defender of the Holy Sepulchre) and felt no obligation to follow him, despite the seriousness of the taking of the cross. Notable absentees were Arnold, Albert III of Namur and Henry of Arlon and Limburg. These were all part of the coalition that had waged war on Godfrey and his principal allies Henry of Verdun and his successor Otbert, Prince-Bishops of Li\u00e8ge. There is some uncertainty as to his sons' whereabouts during the crusade, but upon their return, Otto, who became the next Count of Chiny, found Orval falling in ruins. The Calabrian monks left in 1108, and the Cistercians revived Orval with Otto's help.\nApparently unable to abide by normal legal traditions, Arnold attempted to capture Richilde, Countess of Hainaut, widow of Baldwin VI the Good, Count of Flanders, and her son Baldwin II, Count of Hainaut. Like most of his ventures, he failed in this. In 1082, Richilde and her son went on a pilgrimage to Rome, but on her return in 1084, she learned as she approached Chiny that Arnold was planning to kidnap her. She escaped by taking refuge in Benedictine Abbey of Amdain, in the present-day Saint Hubert.\nHe married Ad\u00e9la\u00efs (Adelaide), daughter of Hilduin IV, Count of Montdidier, Roucy and Ramerupt, and Alix de Roucy.  They had six children:\n\nOtto II, Count of Chiny\nLouis, founder of the priory of Saint-Valpurge at Chiny\nHalide (Hadvide, Hadwida), married to Dodo of Cons (Dudo of Konz-Saarburg), who took the cross and became a Crusader in the army of Godfrey of Bouillon in 1096.

Joan was the daughter of Louis IV, Count of Chiny, and Matilda of Avesnes, and became ruler of the county upon her father\u2019s death on 7 October 1226.

The installation of a Cistercian community in Orval in 1131 marked his last appearance in any proceedings.\nHe married Adelaide (Alix) (1068\u20131124), daughter of Albert III, Count of Namur and Ida of Saxony (widow of Frederick of Lower Lorraine). Their children were:\n\nIda (died before 1125), married to Godfrey I, Count of Leuven\nOda (died after 1134), married to Giselbert II, Count of Duras\nHugues, probably died young\nAlbert of Chiny (before 1131\u20131162)\nFrederick, (died after 1124), Provost at Reims from 1120\nAdalbero II of Chiny-Namur (died 26 March 1145), Bishop of Li\u00e8ge, 1135\u20131145\nEustache (died after 1156), married to a daughter of Wiger de Waremme, Avou\u00e9 of Li\u00e8ge Saint-Lambert and Hesbaye. His son Louis de Lumaine was also Avou\u00e9 of Hesbaye.Ida (also known as Ida of Namur) and Godfrey I (also known as Godfrey the Bearded, not to be confused with the uncle of his father Henry II, Godfrey) were parents of Adeliza of Louvain, wife of Henry I of England.  Oda\u2019s husband Gislebert was son of Otto, Count of Duras and therefore the grandson of Giselbert, the first Count of Looz, whose family would eventually be merged with the Counts of Chiny with the marriage of Otto's great-great granddaughter Jeanne, Countess of Chiny, with Arnold IV of Looz.\nAfter his death, Otto was succeeded as Count of Chiny by his son Albert.\nPassage 6:\nLouis II, Count of Chiny\nLouis II (died before 1066), Count of Chiny (from 1025 until his death), son of Louis I, Count of Chiny and Verdun, and Ad\u00e9la\u00efde de Saint Varme.  He left very few traces in history and nothing is known about his reign.\nLouis was married to Sophie. They had two children:\n\nArnold I, Count of Chiny\nManasses (died 1068), a monk at the Church of St. Hubert.Legend has it that Louis held hunting parties in his huge game park.  Here, Thibault of Champagne established a hermitage and found a source of holy springs, and Louis built a shrine to the spring's healing powers. The shrine became famous, with many pilgrims who came to implore the grace of Saint-Thibault. Later, monks from Calabria, Italy, founded a monastery nearby at Orval at the invitation of Louis\u2019 son Arnold.\nUpon Louis' death, his son Arnold became Count of Chiny.\nPassage 7:\nArnold VI of Rummen, Count of Loon\nArnold VI de Rumigny (died May 1373), Count of Looz and Count of Chiny (as Arnold IV) (1362\u20131364), son of William of Oreye, Lord of Rumigny (by donation of Louis IV, Count of Looz in 1331), and Jeanne de Looz, daughter of Arnold V, Count of Loon and Chiny, and, Marguerite Vianden, Lady of Perwez and Grimbergen.\nIn 1336, at the death of his uncle, Louis IV, Count of Loon and Chiny, Arnold laid claim to the estates, but without success.  Instead, the estates passed to another nephew, Thierry de Heinsberg. Finally, on January 25, 1362, he bought the rights to the counties from his cousin Godfrey, Count of Looz and Chiny.  Looz, however, was still occupied by the troops of Engelbert III of the Marck, Prince-Bishop of Liege.\nOn December 25, Arnold approached the Emperor Charles IV for his help in financing the reconquest of Looz, but he failed in that endeavor.  Without options, he sold the counties to  Wenceslaus, Duke of Luxembourg, on June 16, 1364. On September 23, 1366, he entered into a transaction with John of Arkel, Prince-Bishop of Li\u00e8ge, receiving some financial compensation for the occupation of the counties\nIn 1346, Arnold married Elizabeth of Flanders, illegitimate daughter of Louis of Flanders, Count of Nevers.  No children are recorded.\n\nSources\nArlette Laret-Kayser, Entre Bar et Luxembourg : Le Comt\u00e9 de Chiny des Origines \u00e0 1300, Bruxelles (\u00e9ditions du Cr\u00e9dit Communal, Collection Histoire, s\u00e9rie in-8\u00b0, n\u00b0 72), 1986\nPassage 8:\nArnold I, Count of Chiny\nArnold I (died 16 April 1106), Count of Chiny, son of Louis II, Count of Chiny, and his wife Sophie. He succeeded his father as count before 1066.\nArnold is best known for his many clashes with the authorities.  The only known positive action of his was the founding of the Abbey of Orval with Conrad I, Count of Luxembourg. In addition he began other religious institutions, apparently as atonement for his many crimes. He had many run-ins with the clergy, particularly with Henry, Bishop of Li\u00e8ge, a relative of Godfrey the Bearded, no doubt due to the murder of his grandfather by Godfrey\u2019s father. There were also issues with Henry's successor Otbert.\nA convenient story is that Arnold regularly confronted Godfrey\u2019s grandson Count Godfrey of Bouillon, a leader of the First Crusade and nephew of Countess Mathilda of Tuscany, but that they eventually became friends. Because of this newly-found friendship, he allegedly entrusted Godfrey with his sons Otto and Louis to take part in the crusade. The reality is that this is likely a story concocted by Count Louis V, much like the rest of his version of the history of Chiny (see the discussion in the Counts of Chiny), to enhance his standing at the Tournament of Chauvency in 1285, which included such royalty as Rudolf I, King of Germany.\nIt is clear that Otto and Louis never actually joined the crusade, as their names are not listed among the participants in the Holy quest. The reality of the situation appears that Godfrey's army included relatively few of the major nobles of the duchy, especially those of comital rank. The nobles of Lower Lotharingia were not all vassals of the Duke (and later Defender of the Holy Sepulchre) and felt no obligation to follow him, despite the seriousness of the taking of the cross. Notable absentees were Arnold, Albert III of Namur and Henry of Arlon and Limburg. These were all part of the coalition that had waged war on Godfrey and his principal allies Henry of Verdun and his successor Otbert, Prince-Bishops of Li\u00e8ge. There is some uncertainty as to his sons' whereabouts during the crusade, but upon their return, Otto, who became the next Count of Chiny, found Orval falling in ruins. The Calabrian monks left in 1108, and the Cistercians revived Orval with Otto's help.\nApparently unable to abide by normal legal traditions, Arnold attempted to capture Richilde, Countess of Hainaut, widow of Baldwin VI the Good, Count of Flanders, and her son Baldwin II, Count of Hainaut. Like most of his ventures, he failed in this. In 1082, Richilde and her son went on a pilgrimage to Rome, but on her return in 1084, she learned as she approached Chiny that Arnold was planning to kidnap her. She escaped by taking refuge in Benedictine Abbey of Amdain, in the present-day Saint Hubert.\nHe married Ad\u00e9la\u00efs (Adelaide), daughter of Hilduin IV, Count of Montdidier, Roucy and Ramerupt, and Alix de Roucy.  They had six children:\n\nOtto II, Count of Chiny\nLouis, founder of the priory of Saint-Valpurge at Chiny\nHalide (Hadvide, Hadwida), married to Dodo of Cons (Dudo of Konz-Saarburg), who took the cross and became a Crusader in the army of Godfrey of Bouillon in 1096. He was one of two sons of Adelon de Cons.\nClemence, married to Hugel de Waha, Ch\u00e2telain de Mirwart, who was son of H\u00e9riman de Duras, who in turn was son of Otto I, Count of Duras, and grandson to Giselbert I, Count of Duras.\nBeatrix, mother of Arnulf, Archdeacon of Trier.\nUnnamed daughter, mother to Arnoul and Conon.\nArnold's second wife was Ermengarde (d. 1081), a union for which no children are recorded.

Prior to his current position, Govan worked as the director of the Dia Art Foundation in New York City.\n\nEarly life and education\nGovan was born in 1963 in North Adams, Massachusetts, and was raised in the Washington D.C. area, attending Sidwell Friends School.He majored in art history and fine arts at Williams College, where he met Thomas Krens, who was then director of the Williams College Museum of Art. Govan became closely involved with the museum, serving as acting curator as an undergraduate. After receiving his B.A. from Williams in 1985, Govan began an MFA in fine arts from the University of California, San Diego.\n\nCareer\nAs a twenty-five year old graduate student, Govan was recruited by his former mentor at Williams, Thomas Krens, who in 1988 had been appointed director of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation. Govan served as deputy director of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum under Krens from 1988 to 1994, a period that culminated in the construction and opening of the Frank Gehry designed Guggenheim branch in Bilbao, Spain. Govan supervised the reinstallation of the museum's permanent collection galleries after its extensive renovation.\n\nDia Art Foundation\nFrom 1994 to 2006, Govan was president and director of Dia Art Foundation in New York City. There, he spearheaded the conversion of a Nabisco box factory into the 300,000 square foot Dia:Beacon in New York's Hudson Valley, which houses Dia's collection of art from the 1960s to the present. Built in a former Nabisco box factory, the critically acclaimed museum has been credited with catalyzing a cultural and economic revival within the formerly factory-based city of Beacon. Dia's collection nearly doubled in size during Govan's tenure, but he also came under criticism for \"needlessly and permanently\" closing Dia's West 22nd Street building. During his time at Dia, Govan also worked closely with artists James Turrell and Michael Heizer, becoming an ardent supporter of Roden Crater and City, the artists' respective site-specific land art projects under construction in the American southwest. Govan successfully lobbied Washington to have the 704,000 acres in central Nevada surrounding City declared a national monument in 2015.\n\nLACMA\nIn February 2006, a search committee composed of eleven LACMA trustees, led by the late Nancy M. Daly, recruited Govan to run the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. Govan has stated that he was drawn to the role not only because of LACMA's geographical distance from its European and east coast peers, but also because of the museum's relative youth, having been established in 1961. \"I felt that because of this newness I had the opportunity to reconsider the museum,\" Govan has written, \"[and] Los Angeles is a good place to do that.\"Govan has been widely regarded for transforming LACMA into both a local and international landmark. Since Govan's arrival, LACMA has acquired by donation or purchase over 27,000 works for the permanent collection, and the museum's gallery space has almost doubled thanks to the addition of two new buildings designed by Renzo Piano, the Broad Contemporary Art Museum (BCAM) and the Lynda and Stewart Resnick Pavilion. LACMA's annual attendance has grown from 600,000 to nearly 1.6 million in 2016.\n\nArtist collaborations\nSince his arrival, Govan has commissioned exhibition scenography and gallery designs in collaboration with artists. In 2006, for example, Govan invited LA artist John Baldessari to design an upcoming exhibition about the Belgian surrealist Ren\u00e9 Magritte, resulting in a theatrical show that reflected the twisted perspective of the latter's topsy-turvy world. Baldessari has also designed LACMA's logo. Since then, Govan has also commissioned Cuban-American artist Jorge Pardo to design LACMA's Art of the Ancient Americas gallery, described in the Los Angeles Times as a \"gritty cavern deep inside the earth ... crossed with a high-style urban lounge.\"Govan has also commissioned several large-scale public artworks for LACMA's campus from contemporary California artists. These include Chris Burden's Urban Light (2008), a series of 202 vintage street lamps from different neighborhoods in Los Angeles, arranged in front of the entrance pavilion, Barbara Kruger's Untitled (Shafted) (2008), Robert Irwin's Primal Palm Garden (2010), and Michael Heizer's Levitated Mass, a 340-ton boulder transported 100 miles from the Jurupa Valley to LACMA, a widely publicized journey that culminated with a large celebration on Wilshire Boulevard. Thanks in part to the popularity of these public artworks, LACMA was ranked the fourth most instagrammed museum in the world in 2016.In his first three full years, the museum raised $251 million\u2014about $100 million more than it collected during the three years before he arrived. In 2010, it was announced that Govan will steer LACMA for at least six more years. In a letter dated February 24, 2013, Govan, along with the LACMA board's co-chairmen Terry Semel and Andrew Gordon, proposed a merger with the financially troubled Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles and a plan to raise $100 million for the combined museum.\n\nZumthor Project\nGovan's latest project is an ambitious building project, the replacement of four of the campus's aging buildings with a single new state of the art gallery building designed by architect Peter Zumthor. As of January 2017, he has raised about $300 million in commitments. Construction is expected to begin in 2018, and the new building will open in 2023, to coincide with the opening of the new D Line metro stop on Wilshire Boulevard. The project also envisages dissolving all existing curatorial departments and departmental collections. Some commentators have been highly critical of Govan's plans. Joseph Giovannini, recalling Govan's technically unrealizable onetime plan to hang Jeff Koons' Train sculpture from the facade of the Ahmanson Gallery, has accused Govan of \"driving the institution over a cliff into an equivalent mid-air wreck of its own\". Describing the collection merging proposal as the creation of a \"giant raffle bowl of some 130,000 objects\", Giovannini also points out that the Zumthor building will contain 33% less gallery space than the galleries it will replace, and that the linear footage of wall space available for displays will decrease by about 7,500 ft, or 1.5 miles. Faced with losing a building named in its honor, and anticipating that its acquisitions could no longer be displayed, the Ahmanson Foundation withdrew its support.\nOn the merging of the separate curatorial divisions to create a non-departmental art museum, Christopher Knight has pointed out that \"no other museum of LACMA's size and complexity does it\" that way, and characterized the museum's 2019 \"To Rome and Back\" exhibition, the first to take place under the new scheme, as \"bland and ineffectual\" and an \"unsuccessful sample of what's to come\".\n\nPersonal life\nGovan is married and has two daughters, one from a previous marriage. He and his family used to live in a $6 million mansion in Hancock Park that was provided by LACMA - a benefit worth $155,000 a year, according to most recent tax filings - until LACMA decided that it would sell the property to make up for the museum's of almost $900 million in debt [2]. That home is now worth nearly $8 million and Govan now lives in a trailer park in Malibu's Point Dume region.\nLos Angeles CA 90020\nUnited States.

He was the director of the Peabody Essex Museum in Salem for 17 months, resigning December 31, 2020. He was the director of the Toledo Museum of Art in Ohio from 2010 to 2019. He was the director of the Hood Museum of Art from 2005 to 2010, and the National Gallery of Australia (Canberra) from 1997 to 2004.\n\nCareer\nBrian Kennedy currently lives and works in the United States after leaving Australia in 2005 to direct the Hood Museum of Art at Dartmouth College. In October 2010 he became the ninth Director of the Toledo Museum of Art. On 1 July 2019, he succeeded Dan Monroe as the executive director and CEO of the Peabody Essex Museum.\n\nEarly life and career in Ireland\nKennedy was born in Dublin and attended Clonkeen College. He received B.A. (1982), M.A. (1985) and PhD (1989) degrees from University College-Dublin, where he studied both art history and history.\nHe worked in the Irish Department of Education (1982), the European Commission, Brussels (1983), and in Ireland at the Chester Beatty Library (1983\u201385), Government Publications Office (1985\u201386), and Department of Finance (1986\u201389). He married Mary Fiona Carlin in 1988.He was Assistant Director at the National Gallery of Ireland in Dublin from 1989 to 1997. He was Chair of the Irish Association of Art Historians from 1996 to 1997, and of the Council of Australian Art Museum Directors from 2001 to 2003. In September 1997 he became Director of the National Gallery of Australia.\n\nNational Gallery of Australia (NGA)\nKennedy expanded the traveling exhibitions and loans program throughout Australia, arranged for several major shows of Australian art abroad, increased the number of exhibitions at the museum itself and oversaw the development of an extensive multi-media site.  Although he oversaw several years of the museum's highest ever annual visitation, he discontinued the emphasis of his predecessor, Betty Churcher, on showing \"blockbuster\" exhibitions.\nDuring his directorship, the NGA gained government support for improving the building and significant private donations and corporate sponsorship. However, the initial design for the building proved controversial generating a public dispute with the original architect on moral rights grounds.  As a result, the project was not delivered during Dr Kennedy's tenure, with a significantly altered design completed some years later.  Private funding supported two acquisitions of British art, including David Hockney's A Bigger Grand Canyon in 1999, and Lucian Freud's After C\u00e9zanne in 2001. Kennedy built on the established collections at the museum by acquiring the Holmgren-Spertus collection of Indonesian textiles; the Kenneth Tyler collection of editioned prints, screens, multiples and unique proofs; and the Australian Print Workshop Archive. He was also notable for campaigning for the construction of a new \"front\" entrance to the Gallery, facing King Edward Terrace, which was completed in 2010 (see reference to the building project above).\nKennedy's cancellation of the \"Sensation exhibition\" (scheduled at the NGA from 2 June 2000 to 13 August 2000) was controversial, and seen by some as censorship. He claimed that the decision was due to the exhibition being \"too close to the market\" implying that a national cultural institution cannot exhibit the private collection of a speculative art investor. However, there were other exhibitions at the NGA during his tenure, which could have raised similar concerns. The exhibition featured the privately owned Young British Artists works belonging to Charles Saatchi and attracted large attendances in London and Brooklyn. Its most controversial work was Chris Ofili's The Holy Virgin Mary, a painting which used elephant dung and was accused of being blasphemous. The then-mayor of New York, Rudolph Giuliani, campaigned against the exhibition, claiming it was \"Catholic-bashing\" and an \"aggressive, vicious, disgusting attack on religion.\" In November 1999, Kennedy cancelled the exhibition and stated that the events in New York had \"obscured discussion of the artistic merit of the works of art\". He has said that it \"was the toughest decision of my professional life, so far.\"Kennedy was also repeatedly questioned on his management of a range of issues during the Australian Government's Senate Estimates process - particularly on the NGA's occupational health and safety record and concerns about the NGA's twenty-year-old air-conditioning system. The air-conditioning was finally renovated in 2003. Kennedy announced in 2002 that he would not seek extension of his contract beyond 2004, accepting a seven-year term as had his two predecessors.He became a joint Irish-Australian citizen in 2003.\n\nToledo Museum of Art\nThe Toledo Museum of Art is known for its exceptional collections of European and American paintings and sculpture, glass, antiquities, artist books, Japanese prints and netsuke. The museum offers free admission and is recognized for its historical leadership in the field of art education.  During his tenure, Kennedy has focused the museum's art education efforts on visual literacy, which he defines as \"learning to read, understand and write visual language.\"   Initiatives have included baby and toddler tours, specialized training for all staff, docents, volunteers and the launch of a website, www.vislit.org. In November 2014, the museum hosted the International Visual Literacy Association (IVLA) conference, the first Museum to do so. Kennedy has been a frequent speaker on the topic, including 2010 and 2013 TEDx talks on visual and sensory literacy.\nKennedy has expressed an interest in expanding the museum's collection of contemporary art and art by indigenous peoples. Works by Frank Stella, Sean Scully, Jaume Plensa, Ravinder Reddy and Mary Sibande have been acquired.  In addition, the museum has made major acquisitions of Old Master paintings by Frans Hals and Luca Giordano.During his tenure the Toledo Museum of Art has announced the return of several objects from its collection due to claims the objects were stolen and/or illegally exported prior being sold to the museum.  In 2011 a Meissen sweetmeat stand was returned to Germany followed by an Etruscan Kalpis or water jug to Italy (2013), an Indian sculpture of Ganesha (2014) and an astrological compendium to Germany in 2015.\n\nHood Museum of Art\nKennedy became Director of the Hood Museum of Art in July 2005. During his tenure, he implemented a series of large and small-scale exhibitions and oversaw the production of more than 20 publications to bring greater public attention to the museum's remarkable collections of the arts of America, Europe, Africa, Papua New Guinea and the Polar regions. At 70,000 objects, the Hood has one of the largest collections on any American college of university campus. The exhibition, Black Womanhood: Images, Icons, and Ideologies of the African Body, toured several US venues. Kennedy increased campus curricular use of works of art, with thousands of objects pulled from storage for classes annually. Numerous acquisitions were made with the museum's generous endowments, and he curated several exhibitions: including Wenda Gu: Forest of Stone Steles: Retranslation and Rewriting Tang Dynasty Poetry, Sean Scully: The Art of the Stripe, and Frank Stella: Irregular Polygons.\n\nPublications\nKennedy has written or edited a number of books on art, including:\n\nAlfred Chester Beatty and Ireland 1950-1968: A study in cultural politics, Glendale Press (1988), ISBN 978-0-907606-49-9\nDreams and responsibilities: The state and arts in independent Ireland, Arts Council of Ireland (1990), ISBN 978-0-906627-32-7\nJack B Yeats: Jack Butler Yeats, 1871-1957 (Lives of Irish Artists), Unipub (October 1991), ISBN 978-0-948524-24-0\nThe Anatomy Lesson: Art and Medicine (with Davis Coakley), National Gallery of Ireland (January 1992), ISBN 978-0-903162-65-4\nIreland: Art into History (with Raymond Gillespie), Roberts Rinehart Publishers (1994), ISBN 978-1-57098-005-3\nIrish Painting, Roberts Rinehart Publishers (November 1997),  ISBN 978-1-86059-059-7\nSean Scully: The Art of the Stripe, Hood Museum of Art (October 2008), ISBN 978-0-944722-34-3\nFrank Stella: Irregular Polygons, 1965-1966, Hood Museum of Art (October 2010), ISBN 978-0-944722-39-8\n\nHonors and achievements\nKennedy was awarded the Australian Centenary Medal in 2001 for service to Australian Society and its art. He is a trustee and treasurer of the Association of Art Museum Directors, a peer reviewer for the American Association of Museums and a member of the International Association of Art Critics. In 2013 he was appointed inaugural eminent professor at the University of Toledo and received an honorary doctorate from Lourdes University.

However, there were other exhibitions at the NGA during his tenure, which could have raised similar concerns. The exhibition featured the privately owned Young British Artists works belonging to Charles Saatchi and attracted large attendances in London and Brooklyn. Its most controversial work was Chris Ofili's The Holy Virgin Mary, a painting which used elephant dung and was accused of being blasphemous. The then-mayor of New York, Rudolph Giuliani, campaigned against the exhibition, claiming it was \"Catholic-bashing\" and an \"aggressive, vicious, disgusting attack on religion.\" In November 1999, Kennedy cancelled the exhibition and stated that the events in New York had \"obscured discussion of the artistic merit of the works of art\". He has said that it \"was the toughest decision of my professional life, so far.\"Kennedy was also repeatedly questioned on his management of a range of issues during the Australian Government's Senate Estimates process - particularly on the NGA's occupational health and safety record and concerns about the NGA's twenty-year-old air-conditioning system. The air-conditioning was finally renovated in 2003. Kennedy announced in 2002 that he would not seek extension of his contract beyond 2004, accepting a seven-year term as had his two predecessors.He became a joint Irish-Australian citizen in 2003.\n\nToledo Museum of Art\nThe Toledo Museum of Art is known for its exceptional collections of European and American paintings and sculpture, glass, antiquities, artist books, Japanese prints and netsuke. The museum offers free admission and is recognized for its historical leadership in the field of art education.  During his tenure, Kennedy has focused the museum's art education efforts on visual literacy, which he defines as \"learning to read, understand and write visual language.\"   Initiatives have included baby and toddler tours, specialized training for all staff, docents, volunteers and the launch of a website, www.vislit.org. In November 2014, the museum hosted the International Visual Literacy Association (IVLA) conference, the first Museum to do so. Kennedy has been a frequent speaker on the topic, including 2010 and 2013 TEDx talks on visual and sensory literacy.\nKennedy has expressed an interest in expanding the museum's collection of contemporary art and art by indigenous peoples. Works by Frank Stella, Sean Scully, Jaume Plensa, Ravinder Reddy and Mary Sibande have been acquired.  In addition, the museum has made major acquisitions of Old Master paintings by Frans Hals and Luca Giordano.During his tenure the Toledo Museum of Art has announced the return of several objects from its collection due to claims the objects were stolen and/or illegally exported prior being sold to the museum.  In 2011 a Meissen sweetmeat stand was returned to Germany followed by an Etruscan Kalpis or water jug to Italy (2013), an Indian sculpture of Ganesha (2014) and an astrological compendium to Germany in 2015.\n\nHood Museum of Art\nKennedy became Director of the Hood Museum of Art in July 2005. During his tenure, he implemented a series of large and small-scale exhibitions and oversaw the production of more than 20 publications to bring greater public attention to the museum's remarkable collections of the arts of America, Europe, Africa, Papua New Guinea and the Polar regions. At 70,000 objects, the Hood has one of the largest collections on any American college of university campus. The exhibition, Black Womanhood: Images, Icons, and Ideologies of the African Body, toured several US venues. Kennedy increased campus curricular use of works of art, with thousands of objects pulled from storage for classes annually. Numerous acquisitions were made with the museum's generous endowments, and he curated several exhibitions: including Wenda Gu: Forest of Stone Steles: Retranslation and Rewriting Tang Dynasty Poetry, Sean Scully: The Art of the Stripe, and Frank Stella: Irregular Polygons.\n\nPublications\nKennedy has written or edited a number of books on art, including:\n\nAlfred Chester Beatty and Ireland 1950-1968: A study in cultural politics, Glendale Press (1988), ISBN 978-0-907606-49-9\nDreams and responsibilities: The state and arts in independent Ireland, Arts Council of Ireland (1990), ISBN 978-0-906627-32-7\nJack B Yeats: Jack Butler Yeats, 1871-1957 (Lives of Irish Artists), Unipub (October 1991), ISBN 978-0-948524-24-0\nThe Anatomy Lesson: Art and Medicine (with Davis Coakley), National Gallery of Ireland (January 1992), ISBN 978-0-903162-65-4\nIreland: Art into History (with Raymond Gillespie), Roberts Rinehart Publishers (1994), ISBN 978-1-57098-005-3\nIrish Painting, Roberts Rinehart Publishers (November 1997),  ISBN 978-1-86059-059-7\nSean Scully: The Art of the Stripe, Hood Museum of Art (October 2008), ISBN 978-0-944722-34-3\nFrank Stella: Irregular Polygons, 1965-1966, Hood Museum of Art (October 2010), ISBN 978-0-944722-39-8\n\nHonors and achievements\nKennedy was awarded the Australian Centenary Medal in 2001 for service to Australian Society and its art. He is a trustee and treasurer of the Association of Art Museum Directors, a peer reviewer for the American Association of Museums and a member of the International Association of Art Critics. In 2013 he was appointed inaugural eminent professor at the University of Toledo and received an honorary doctorate from Lourdes University.

The album was originally meant to be entitled Kissing the Beehive; however, due to possible copyright infringements in relation to Jonathan Carroll's 1997 novel of the same name, this title was changed. Singer and keyboardist Spencer Krug said that the band \"didn't know that was the title of a book... We might have to change it, but we might not. And we'll have to make it clear that it's not [named] after his book. It's a complicated situation.\" It had also been reported earlier by Blender that the record was entitled Pardon My Blues; however, on April 28, Sub Pop officially announced that the album's name would be At Mount Zoomer.\n\nAlbum overview\nThe band started playing new songs live that would end up on At Mount Zoomer as early as summer 2007. Among the first to be played were \"Language City\" and \"Fine Young Cannibals\".\nAccording to singer and guitarist Dan Boeckner, half of the album was recorded in Farnham, Quebec at Petite \u00c9glise, an old church that was converted to a recording studio by the band Arcade Fire for the production of their album Neon Bible. After touring the east coast in late 2007, Wolf Parade recorded the rest of At Mount Zoomer at MIXart Studios in Montreal, Quebec. Afterwards, the album was mixed at Arlen Thompson's sound studio, Mount Zoomer.The cover art for the album features the work of Matt Moroz and Elizabeth Huey, depicting a battle scene between the two artists.The track \"Call It a Ritual\" was released by the band on April 14, 2008.\n\nReception\nAt Mount Zoomer received positive reviews from critics. On Metacritic, the album holds a score of 78 out of 100 based on 28 reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".\n\nTrack listing\nPersonnel\nWolf Parade \u2013 mixing, producing, \"overdubs and vocals recorded by\"\nHarris Newman \u2013 mastering\nArlen Thompson \u2013 recording (tracks 1, 2, 4, 6-8), \"one vocal recorded by\"\nDavid Ferry \u2013 recording (tracks 3, 5, 9)\nNick Petrowski \u2013 recording (tracks 3, 5, 9)\nDavid Smith \u2013 \"some vocals recorded by\"\nJace Lasek \u2013 \"some vocals recorded by\"\nElizabeth Huey \u2013 artwork\nMatt Moroz \u2013 artwork\nPassage 5:\nTear Ourselves Away\nTear Ourselves Away is the first full-length LP by San Francisco-based indie rock band LoveLikeFire.

Blow in the Wind features several tracks which are led off with musical mash-ups of, or homages to, classic Punk songs, a trend the group began on their second album, Are a Drag (with an appropriation of \"Generator\" by Bad Religion for their cover of \"My Favorite Things\") and would continue with Take a Break and Ruin Jonny's Bar Mitzvah: \"Sloop John B\" samples \"Teenage Lobotomy\" by The Ramones, \"Elenor\" samples \"London Calling\" by The Clash, \"San Francisco\" samples \"Stranger Than Fiction\" by Bad Religion, \"I Only Want to Be With You\" samples and \"The Money Will Roll Right In\" by Fang. Similarly, the track \"Different Drum\" also ends with a guitar riff taken from \"Georgy Girl\" by the Seekers.\nThe first song begins with a clip similar to the hidden track on the NOFX album Punk in Drublic where Fat Mike attempts to find the proper pitch of the word \"how\" in the line \"How did the cat get so fat?\" from \"Perfect Government\".\nThe album is made up entirely of \"Hits of the 1960s\". The band's version of \"Different Drum\" can be heard during the credits of the film Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story.\nThe band's version of \"Sloop John B\" is featured in the 2013 film The Wolf of Wall Street.\n\nTrack listing\nPersonnel\nSpike Slawson - vocals\nChris Shiflett (a.k.a.

It introduced the band's style of fast, abrasive punk rock with tongue-in-cheek humor and sarcastic lyrics. The album was originally released as an LP but was repackaged the following year as a CD including tracks from the band's first 2 EPs Puke and Balls, as well as the previously unreleased tracks \"Malted Vomit\" and \"Ghost.\" It was re-released again in 1996 by Nitro Records under the title The Album Formerly Known as Full Length LP.\nThe album proved to be a success for the band, expanding their fan base and giving them opportunities to play shows all over southern California alongside other popular punk rock bands. An animated music video was made for the song \u201c1, 2, 3\u2026Slam!\u201d and played on local punk rock and skateboarding video programs.

{"prompt": "Answer the question based on the given passages. Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\nLyon Cohen\nLyon Cohen (born Yehuda Leib Cohen; May 11, 1868 \u2013 August 17, 1937) was a Polish-born Canadian businessman and a philanthropist. He was the grandfather of singer/poet Leonard Cohen.\n\nBiography\nCohen was born in Congress Poland, part of the Russian Empire, to a Jewish family on May 11, 1868. He immigrated to Canada with his parents in 1871. He was educated at the McGill Model School and the Catholic Commercial Academy in Montreal. In 1888, he entered the firm of Lee & Cohen in Montreal; later became partner with his father in the firm of L. Cohen & Son; in 1895, he established W. R. Cuthbert & Co; in 1900, he organized the Canadian Improvement Co., a dredging contractor; in 1906, he founded The Freedman Co. in Montreal; and in May 1919, he organized and became President of Canadian Export Clothiers, Ltd.  The Freedman Company went on to become one of Montreal\u2019s largest clothing companies.In 1897, Cohen and Samuel William Jacobs founded the Canadian Jewish Times, the first English-language Jewish newspaper in Canada. The newspaper promoted the Canadianization of recent East European Jewish immigrants and encouraged their acceptance of Canadian customs as Cohen felt that the old world customs of immigrant Jews were one of the main causes of anti-Semitism. In 1914, the paper was purchased by Hirsch Wolofsky, owner of the Yiddish-language Keneder Adler, who transformed it into the Canadian Jewish Chronicle.He died on August 17, 1937, at the age of 69.\n\nPhilanthropy\nCohen was elected the first president of the Canadian Jewish Congress in 1919 and organized the Jewish Immigrant Aid Services of Canada. Cohen was also a leader of the Young Men\u2019s Hebrew Benevolent Society (later the Baron de Hirsch Institute) and the United Talmud Torahs, a Jewish day school in Montreal. He also served as president of Congregation Shaar Hashomayim and president of the Jewish Colonization Association in Canada.\n\nPersonal life\nCohen married Rachel Friedman of Montreal on February 17, 1891. She was the founder and President of Jewish Endeavour Sewing School. They had three sons and one daughter:\n\nNathan Bernard Cohen, who served as a lieutenant in the World War; he married Lithuanian Jewish immigrant Masha Klonitsky and they had one daughter and one son:\nEsther Cohen and\nsinger/poet Leonard Cohen.\nHorace Rives Cohen, who was a captain and quartermaster of his battalion in World War I;\nLawrence Zebulun Cohen, student at McGill University, and\nSylvia Lillian Cohen.\nPassage 2:\nTr\u1ecbnh C\u01b0\u01a1ng\nTr\u1ecbnh C\u01b0\u01a1ng (H\u00e1n t\u1ef1: \u912d\u68e1; 9 July 1686 \u2013 20 December 1729) was the lord who ruled Tonkin from 1709 to 1729 (his title as ruler was An \u0110\u00f4 V\u01b0\u01a1ng). Tr\u1ecbnh C\u01b0\u01a1ng was born to Tr\u1ecbnh B\u00ednh, a grandson of the former lord Tr\u1ecbnh C\u0103n. He belonged to the line of Tr\u1ecbnh lords who had ruled parts of Vietnam since 1545. Like his great-grandfather and predecessor, Tr\u1ecbnh C\u0103n, his reign was mostly devoted to administrative reforms.\n\nBiography\nTr\u1ecbnh C\u01b0\u01a1ng ruled Vi\u1ec7t Nam during a time of external peace but growing internal strife. He enacted many governmental reforms in both financial matters and judicial rules. His main concern was the growing problem of landless peasants. Unlike the Nguy\u1ec5n lords who were constantly expanding their territory south, the Tr\u1ecbnh lords had little room for expansion. Hence, the land supply was essentially fixed but the population kept growing.\nTr\u1ecbnh C\u01b0\u01a1ng tried various legislative means to solve the problem. He tried to limit private land holdings. He tried to redistribute the communal fields of the small villages. Nothing really worked and the problem became very serious over the succeeding decades. According to historian R. H. Bruce Lockhart, the governmental reforms enacted by Tr\u1ecbnh C\u01b0\u01a1ng and his great-grandfather, Tr\u1ecbnh C\u0103n, made the government more effective but, they also made the government more of a burden to the people. This had the effect of increasing the hatred felt by the people towards the Tr\u1ecbnh rulers in Hanoi.\nTr\u1ecbnh C\u01b0\u01a1ng passed an edict forbidding people to practice Christianity in 1712. Like previous efforts to suppress Christianity, this had little real effect in Vietnam. However, he tried to offer the people an alternative, and he had many Buddhist pagodas constructed during his rule.\nAs far as the L\u00ea dynasty was concerned, the emperor, L\u00ea D\u1ee5 T\u00f4ng, ruled throughout Tr\u1ecbnh C\u01b0\u01a1ng's lifetime. The two men died within a few months of each other in 1729.\n\nSources\nEncyclopedia of Asian History, Volume 4. 1988.

He was the grandfather of Ertu\u011frul Ghazi, the father of the founder of the Ottoman Empire, Osman I. He was also famously known for being the successing name of Ertokus Bey\u2019s son Kaya Alp. He was a descendant of the ancestor of his tribe, Kay\u0131 son of Gun son of Oghuz Khagan, the legendary progenitor of the Oghuz Turks.\nPassage 4:\nNguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb Ng\u1ecdc Di\u1ec5m\nNguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb Ng\u1ecdc Di\u1ec5m (H\u00e1n t\u1ef1: \u962e\u6c0f\u7389\u7430, 1721\u20131784), posthumous name T\u1eeb Tr\u1ea1ch (\u6148\u6fa4), was a consort of lord Tr\u1ecbnh Doanh.\n\nBiography\nLady Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb Ng\u1ecdc Di\u1ec5m was born in 1721 at Linh \u0110\u01b0\u1eddng village, Linh \u0110\u00e0m commune, Thanh Tr\u00ec district, Southern of Ph\u1ee5ng Thi\u00ean prefect. She was commended to Tr\u1ecbnh clan's palace by her father who was Duke Nguy\u1ec5n V\u0103n Lu\u00e2n (\u962e\u6587\u502b, 1686\u20131739). She became a concubine of prince Tr\u1ecbnh Doanh and was granted the title Hoa Dung (\u82b1\u5bb9).\nPassage 5:\nZhao Shoushan\nZhao Shoushan (simplified Chinese: \u8d75\u5bff\u5c71; traditional Chinese: \u8d99\u58fd\u5c71; pinyin: Zh\u00e0o Sh\u00f2ush\u0101n; 12 November 1894 \u2013 20 June 1965) was a KMT general and later Chinese Communist Party politician. He is the grandfather of Zhao Leji.\n\nCareer\nZhao Shoushan was born in Hu County, Shaanxi in 1894. After the foundation of the People's Republic of China, Zhao was the CCP Chairman of Qinghai and Governor of Shaanxi.\n\nExternal links\n(in Chinese) Biography of Zhao Shoushan, Shaanxi Daily July 9, 2006.\nPassage 6:\nTr\u1ecbnh Doanh\nTr\u1ecbnh Doanh (4 December 1720 \u2013 15 February 1767) ruled northern Vietnam (Tonkin) from 1740 to 1767 (he ruled with the title Minh \u0110\u00f4 V\u01b0\u01a1ng). Tr\u1ecbnh Doanh was the third son of Tr\u1ecbnh C\u01b0\u01a1ng, and belonged to the line of Tr\u1ecbnh lords who ruled northern Vietnam. His rule was spent putting down rebellions against Tr\u1ecbnh rule.\n\nTr\u1ecbnh Doanh took over from his brother, Tr\u1ecbnh Giang, who, through financial mismanagement and bad behavior, provoked a wave of revolts against his rule. This was a time of increasing peasant revolts in both the north and the south under the Nguy\u1ec5n lords. In the north, some of the revolts were apparently led by members of the royal L\u00ea family. The rebellions which broke out in Tonkin during this period, were almost without number. Princes belonging to the royal family, generals, civil mandarins, common people, and out-casts from the hills, all rose in the provinces against the tyranny of the Tr\u1ecbnh, as well as for their personal interests. Chapter 16 (continued) \nDespite the many revolts, Tr\u1ecbnh Doanh defeated them all and passed the rule of Vietnam to his son, Tr\u1ecbnh S\u00e2m.\nAs far as the L\u00ea dynasty was concerned, there was just one emperor, L\u00ea Hien T\u00f4ng (1740\u20131786), who occupied the royal throne in Hanoi.\n\nSee also\nL\u00ea dynasty\n\nSources\nEncyclopedia of Asian History, Volumes 4. 1988.

He played college football at St. Louis University.\nPassage 8:\nAbd al-Muttalib\nShayba ibn H\u0101shim (Arabic: \u0634\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0628\u064e\u0629 \u0625\u0628\u0652\u0646 \u0647\u064e\u0627\u0634\u0650\u0645; c.\u2009497\u2013578), better known as \u02bfAbd al-Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib, (Arabic: \u0639\u064e\u0628\u0652\u062f \u0671\u0644\u0652\u0645\u064f\u0637\u064e\u0651\u0644\u0650\u0628, lit.\u2009'Servant of Muttalib') was the fourth chief of the Quraysh tribal confederation. He was the grandfather of the Islamic prophet Muhammad.\n\nEarly life\nHis father was Hashim ibn 'Abd Manaf,:\u200a81\u200a the progenitor of the distinguished Banu Hashim, a clan of the Quraysh tribe of Mecca. They claimed descent from Ism\u0101'\u012bl and Ibr\u0101h\u012bm. His mother was Salma bint Amr, from the Banu Najjar, a clan of the Khazraj tribe in Yathrib (later called Madinah). Hashim died while doing business in Gaza, before Abd al-Muttalib was born.:\u200a81\u200aHis real name was \"Shaiba\" meaning 'the ancient one' or 'white-haired' because of the streak of white through his jet-black hair, and is sometimes also called Shaybah al-\u1e24amd (\"The white streak of praise\").:\u200a81\u201382\u200a After his father's death he was raised in Yathrib with his mother and her family until about the age of eight, when his uncle Muttalib ibn Abd Manaf went to see him and asked his mother Salmah to entrust Shaybah to his care. Salmah was unwilling to let her son go and Shaiba refused to leave his mother without her consent. Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib then pointed out that the possibilities Yathrib had to offer were incomparable to Mecca. Salmah was impressed with his arguments, so she agreed to let him go. Upon first arriving in Mecca, the people assumed the unknown child was Muttalib's servant and started calling him 'Abd al-Muttalib (\"servant of Muttalib\").:\u200a85\u201386\n\nChieftain of Hashim clan\nWhen Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib died, Shaiba succeeded him as the chief of the H\u0101shim clan. Following his uncle Al-Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib, he took over the duties of providing the pilgrims with food and water, and carried on the practices of his forefathers with his people. He attained such eminence as none of his forefathers enjoyed; his people loved him and his reputation was great among them.:\u200a61\u200a\n'Umar ibn Al-Kha\u1e6d\u1e6d\u0101b's grandfather Nufayl ibn Abdul Uzza arbitrated in a dispute between 'Abdul-Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib and \u1e24arb ibn Umayyah, Abu Sufyan's father, over the custodianship of the Kaaba. Nufayl gave his verdict in favour of 'Abdul-Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib. Addressing \u1e24arb ibn Umayyah, he said:\nWhy do you pick a quarrel with a person who is taller than you in stature; more imposing than you in appearance; more refined than you in intellect; whose progeny outnumbers yours and whose generosity outshines yours in lustre? Do not, however, construe this into any disparagement of your good qualities which I highly appreciate. You are as gentle as a lamb, you are renowned throughout Arabia for the stentorian tones of your voice, and you are an asset to your tribe.\n\nDiscovery of Zam Zam Well\n'Abdul-Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib said that while sleeping in the sacred enclosure, he had dreamed he was ordered to dig at the worship place of the Quraysh between the two deities Is\u0101f and N\u0101'ila. There he would find the Zamzam Well, which the Jurhum tribe had filled in when they left Mecca. The Quraysh tried to stop him digging in that spot, but his son Al-\u1e24\u0101rith stood guard until they gave up their protests. After three days of digging, 'Abdul-Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib found traces of an ancient religious well and exclaimed, \"Allahuakbar!\" Some of the Quraysh disputed his claim to sole rights over water, then one of them suggested that they go to a female shaman who lived afar. It was said that she could summon jinns and that she could help them decide who was the owner of the well. So, 11 people from the 11 tribes went on the expedition. They had to cross the desert to meet the priestess but then they got lost. There was a lack of food and water and people started to lose hope of ever getting out. One of them suggested that they dig their own graves and if they died, the last person standing would bury the others. So all began digging their own graves and just as Abdul-Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib started digging, water spewed out from the hole he dug and everyone became overjoyed. It was then and there decided that Abdul-Muttalib was the owner of the Zam Zam well. Thereafter he supplied pilgrims to the Kaaba with Zam Zam water, which soon eclipsed all the other wells in Mecca because it was considered sacred.:\u200a86\u201389\u200a:\u200a62\u201365\n\nThe Year of the Elephant\nAccording to Muslim tradition, the Ethiopian governor of Yemen, Abrahah al-Ashram, envied the Kaaba's reverence among the Arabs and, being a Christian, he built a cathedral on Sana'a and ordered pilgrimage be made there.:\u200a21\u200a The order was ignored and someone desecrated (some saying in the form of defecation:\u200a696 note 35\u200a) the cathedral. Abrahah decided to avenge this act by demolishing the Kaaba and he advanced with an army towards Mecca.:\u200a22\u201323\u200aThere were thirteen elephants in Abrahah's army:\u200a99\u200a:\u200a26\u200a and the year came to be known as '\u0100m al-F\u012bl (the Year of the Elephant), beginning a trend for reckoning the years in Arabia which was used until 'Umar ibn Al-Kha\u1e6d\u1e6d\u0101b replaced it with the Islamic Calendar in 638 CE (17 AH), with the first year of the Islamic Calendar being 622 CE.\nWhen news of the advance of Abrahah's army came, the Arab tribes of Quraysh, Kin\u0101nah, Khuz\u0101'ah and Hudhayl united in defence of the Kaaba. A man from the \u1e24imyar tribe was sent by Abrahah to advise them that he only wished to demolish the Kaaba and if they resisted, they would be crushed. \"Abdul-Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib told the Meccans to seek refuge in the nearest high hills while he, with some leading members of Quraysh, remained within the precincts of the Kaaba. Abrahah sent a dispatch inviting 'Abdul-Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib to meet him and discuss matters. When 'Abdul-Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib left the meeting he was heard saying, \"The Owner of this House is its Defender, and I am sure He will save it from the attack of the adversaries and will not dishonour the servants of His House.\":\u200a24\u201326\u200aIt is recorded that when Abrahah's forces neared the Kaaba, Allah commanded small birds (ab\u0101b\u012bl) to destroy Abrahah's army, raining down pebbles on it from their beaks. Abrahah was seriously wounded and retreated towards Yemen but died on the way.:\u200a26\u201327\u200a This event is referred to in the following Qur'anic chapter:\n\nHave you not seen how your Lord dealt with the owners of the Elephant?\nDid He not make their treacherous plan go astray?\n\nAnd He sent against them birds in flocks, striking them with stones of baked clay, so He rendered them like straw eaten up.\nMost Islamic sources place the event around the year that Muhammad was born, 570 CE, though other scholars place it one or two decades earlier. A tradition attributed to Ibn Shihab al-Zuhri in the musannaf of \u02bdAbd al-Razzaq al-San\u02bdani places it before the birth of Muhammad's father.\n\nSacrificing his son Abdullah\nAl-Harith was 'Abdul-Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib's only son at the time he dug the Zamzam Well.:\u200a64\u200a When the Quraysh tried to help him in the digging, he vowed that if he were to have ten sons to protect him, he would sacrifice one of them to Allah at the Kaaba. Later, after nine more sons had been born to him, he told them he must keep the vow. The divination arrows fell upon his favourite son Abdullah. The Quraysh protested 'Abdul-Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib's intention to sacrifice his son and demanded that he sacrifice something else instead. 'Abdul-Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib agreed to consult a \"sorceress with a familiar spirit\". She told him to cast lots between Abdullah and ten camels. If Abdullah were chosen, he had to add ten more camels, and keep on doing the same until his Lord accepted the camels in Abdullah's place. When the number of camels reached 100, the lot fell on the camels. 'Abdul-Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib confirmed this by repeating the test three times. Then the camels were sacrificed, and Abdullah was spared.:\u200a66\u201368\n\nFamily\nWives\nAbd al-Muttalib had six known wives.\n\nSumra bint Jundab of the Hawazin tribe.\nLubn\u0101 bint H\u0101jar of the Khuza'a tribe.\nFatima bint Amr of the Makhzum clan of the Quraysh tribe.\nHalah bint Wuhayb of the Zuhrah clan of the Quraysh tribe.\nNat\u012bla bint Janab of the Namir tribe.\nMumanna'a bint Amr of the Khuza'a tribe.\n\nChildren\nAccording to Ibn Hisham, \u02bfAbd al-Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib had ten sons and six daughters.:\u200a707\u2013708 note 97\u200a However, Ibn Sa'd lists twelve sons.:\u200a99\u2013101\u200aBy Sumra bint Jundab:\n\nAl-\u1e24\u0101rith.:\u200a708\u200a He was the firstborn and he died before his father.:\u200a99\u200a\nQuthum.:\u200a100\u200a He is not listed by Ibn Hisham.By Fatima bint Amr:\n\nAl-Zubayr.:\u200a707\u200a He was a poet and a chief; his father made a will in his favour.:\u200a99\u200a He died before Islam, leaving two sons and daughters.:\u200a101\u200a:\u200a34\u201335\u200a\nAbu Talib, born as Abd Manaf,:\u200a99\u200a:\u200a707\u200a father of the future Caliph Ali.

So, Muhammad, Amina, Abd al-Muttalib and their caretaker, Umm Ayman started their journey to Medina, which is around 500 kilometres away from Makkah. They stayed there for three weeks, then, started their journey back to Mecca. But, when they reached halfway, at Al-Abwa', Amina became very sick and died six years after her husband's death. She was buried over there. From then, Muhammad became an orphan. Abd al-Muttalib became very sad for Muhammad because he loved him so much. Abd al-Muttalib took care of Muhammad.

Bartholomew Westley and Ann Colley, daughter of Sir Henry Colley of Carbery Castle in County Kildare, Ireland. He was educated at Dorchester Grammar School and as a student of New Inn Hall, Oxford, where he matriculated on 23 April 1651, and graduated B.A. on 23 January 1655, and M.A. on 4 July 1657. After his appointment as an evangelist, he preached at Melcombe Regis, Radipole, and other areas in Dorset. Never episcopally ordained, he was approved by Oliver Cromwell's Commission of Triers in 1658 and appointed Vicar of Winterborne Whitechurch.The report of his interview in 1661 with Gilbert Ironside the elder, his diocesan, according to Alexander Gordon writing in the Dictionary of National Biography, shows him to have been an Independent. He was imprisoned for not using the Book of Common Prayer, imprisoned again and ejected in 1662. After the Conventicle Act 1664 he continued to preach in small gatherings at Preston and then Poole, until his death at Preston in 1678.\n\nFamily\nHe married a daughter of John White, who was related also to Thomas Fuller.

He was the grandfather of singer/poet Leonard Cohen.\n\nBiography\nCohen was born in Congress Poland, part of the Russian Empire, to a Jewish family on May 11, 1868. He immigrated to Canada with his parents in 1871. He was educated at the McGill Model School and the Catholic Commercial Academy in Montreal. In 1888, he entered the firm of Lee & Cohen in Montreal; later became partner with his father in the firm of L. Cohen & Son; in 1895, he established W. R. Cuthbert & Co; in 1900, he organized the Canadian Improvement Co., a dredging contractor; in 1906, he founded The Freedman Co. in Montreal; and in May 1919, he organized and became President of Canadian Export Clothiers, Ltd.  The Freedman Company went on to become one of Montreal\u2019s largest clothing companies.In 1897, Cohen and Samuel William Jacobs founded the Canadian Jewish Times, the first English-language Jewish newspaper in Canada. The newspaper promoted the Canadianization of recent East European Jewish immigrants and encouraged their acceptance of Canadian customs as Cohen felt that the old world customs of immigrant Jews were one of the main causes of anti-Semitism. In 1914, the paper was purchased by Hirsch Wolofsky, owner of the Yiddish-language Keneder Adler, who transformed it into the Canadian Jewish Chronicle.He died on August 17, 1937, at the age of 69.\n\nPhilanthropy\nCohen was elected the first president of the Canadian Jewish Congress in 1919 and organized the Jewish Immigrant Aid Services of Canada. Cohen was also a leader of the Young Men\u2019s Hebrew Benevolent Society (later the Baron de Hirsch Institute) and the United Talmud Torahs, a Jewish day school in Montreal. He also served as president of Congregation Shaar Hashomayim and president of the Jewish Colonization Association in Canada.\n\nPersonal life\nCohen married Rachel Friedman of Montreal on February 17, 1891. She was the founder and President of Jewish Endeavour Sewing School. They had three sons and one daughter:\n\nNathan Bernard Cohen, who served as a lieutenant in the World War; he married Lithuanian Jewish immigrant Masha Klonitsky and they had one daughter and one son:\nEsther Cohen and\nsinger/poet Leonard Cohen.\nHorace Rives Cohen, who was a captain and quartermaster of his battalion in World War I;\nLawrence Zebulun Cohen, student at McGill University, and\nSylvia Lillian Cohen.\nPassage 2:\nTr\u1ecbnh C\u01b0\u01a1ng\nTr\u1ecbnh C\u01b0\u01a1ng (H\u00e1n t\u1ef1: \u912d\u68e1; 9 July 1686 \u2013 20 December 1729) was the lord who ruled Tonkin from 1709 to 1729 (his title as ruler was An \u0110\u00f4 V\u01b0\u01a1ng). Tr\u1ecbnh C\u01b0\u01a1ng was born to Tr\u1ecbnh B\u00ednh, a grandson of the former lord Tr\u1ecbnh C\u0103n. He belonged to the line of Tr\u1ecbnh lords who had ruled parts of Vietnam since 1545. Like his great-grandfather and predecessor, Tr\u1ecbnh C\u0103n, his reign was mostly devoted to administrative reforms.\n\nBiography\nTr\u1ecbnh C\u01b0\u01a1ng ruled Vi\u1ec7t Nam during a time of external peace but growing internal strife. He enacted many governmental reforms in both financial matters and judicial rules. His main concern was the growing problem of landless peasants. Unlike the Nguy\u1ec5n lords who were constantly expanding their territory south, the Tr\u1ecbnh lords had little room for expansion. Hence, the land supply was essentially fixed but the population kept growing.\nTr\u1ecbnh C\u01b0\u01a1ng tried various legislative means to solve the problem. He tried to limit private land holdings. He tried to redistribute the communal fields of the small villages. Nothing really worked and the problem became very serious over the succeeding decades. According to historian R. H. Bruce Lockhart, the governmental reforms enacted by Tr\u1ecbnh C\u01b0\u01a1ng and his great-grandfather, Tr\u1ecbnh C\u0103n, made the government more effective but, they also made the government more of a burden to the people. This had the effect of increasing the hatred felt by the people towards the Tr\u1ecbnh rulers in Hanoi.\nTr\u1ecbnh C\u01b0\u01a1ng passed an edict forbidding people to practice Christianity in 1712. Like previous efforts to suppress Christianity, this had little real effect in Vietnam. However, he tried to offer the people an alternative, and he had many Buddhist pagodas constructed during his rule.\nAs far as the L\u00ea dynasty was concerned, the emperor, L\u00ea D\u1ee5 T\u00f4ng, ruled throughout Tr\u1ecbnh C\u01b0\u01a1ng's lifetime.

Tr\u1ecbnh Doanh was the third son of Tr\u1ecbnh C\u01b0\u01a1ng, and belonged to the line of Tr\u1ecbnh lords who ruled northern Vietnam.

This was a time of increasing peasant revolts in both the north and the south under the Nguy\u1ec5n lords. In the north, some of the revolts were apparently led by members of the royal L\u00ea family. The rebellions which broke out in Tonkin during this period, were almost without number.

He was the grandfather of the Islamic prophet Muhammad.\n\nEarly life\nHis father was Hashim ibn 'Abd Manaf,:\u200a81\u200a the progenitor of the distinguished Banu Hashim, a clan of the Quraysh tribe of Mecca. They claimed descent from Ism\u0101'\u012bl and Ibr\u0101h\u012bm. His mother was Salma bint Amr, from the Banu Najjar, a clan of the Khazraj tribe in Yathrib (later called Madinah). Hashim died while doing business in Gaza, before Abd al-Muttalib was born.:\u200a81\u200aHis real name was \"Shaiba\" meaning 'the ancient one' or 'white-haired' because of the streak of white through his jet-black hair, and is sometimes also called Shaybah al-\u1e24amd (\"The white streak of praise\").:\u200a81\u201382\u200a After his father's death he was raised in Yathrib with his mother and her family until about the age of eight, when his uncle Muttalib ibn Abd Manaf went to see him and asked his mother Salmah to entrust Shaybah to his care. Salmah was unwilling to let her son go and Shaiba refused to leave his mother without her consent. Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib then pointed out that the possibilities Yathrib had to offer were incomparable to Mecca. Salmah was impressed with his arguments, so she agreed to let him go.

Following his uncle Al-Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib, he took over the duties of providing the pilgrims with food and water, and carried on the practices of his forefathers with his people.

Nufayl gave his verdict in favour of 'Abdul-Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib. Addressing \u1e24arb ibn Umayyah, he said:\nWhy do you pick a quarrel with a person who is taller than you in stature; more imposing than you in appearance; more refined than you in intellect; whose progeny outnumbers yours and whose generosity outshines yours in lustre? Do not, however, construe this into any disparagement of your good qualities which I highly appreciate. You are as gentle as a lamb, you are renowned throughout Arabia for the stentorian tones of your voice, and you are an asset to your tribe.\n\nDiscovery of Zam Zam Well\n'Abdul-Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib said that while sleeping in the sacred enclosure, he had dreamed he was ordered to dig at the worship place of the Quraysh between the two deities Is\u0101f and N\u0101'ila. There he would find the Zamzam Well, which the Jurhum tribe had filled in when they left Mecca. The Quraysh tried to stop him digging in that spot, but his son Al-\u1e24\u0101rith stood guard until they gave up their protests. After three days of digging, 'Abdul-Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib found traces of an ancient religious well and exclaimed, \"Allahuakbar!\" Some of the Quraysh disputed his claim to sole rights over water, then one of them suggested that they go to a female shaman who lived afar. It was said that she could summon jinns and that she could help them decide who was the owner of the well. So, 11 people from the 11 tribes went on the expedition. They had to cross the desert to meet the priestess but then they got lost. There was a lack of food and water and people started to lose hope of ever getting out. One of them suggested that they dig their own graves and if they died, the last person standing would bury the others. So all began digging their own graves and just as Abdul-Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib started digging, water spewed out from the hole he dug and everyone became overjoyed. It was then and there decided that Abdul-Muttalib was the owner of the Zam Zam well. Thereafter he supplied pilgrims to the Kaaba with Zam Zam water, which soon eclipsed all the other wells in Mecca because it was considered sacred.:\u200a86\u201389\u200a:\u200a62\u201365\n\nThe Year of the Elephant\nAccording to Muslim tradition, the Ethiopian governor of Yemen, Abrahah al-Ashram, envied the Kaaba's reverence among the Arabs and, being a Christian, he built a cathedral on Sana'a and ordered pilgrimage be made there.:\u200a21\u200a The order was ignored and someone desecrated (some saying in the form of defecation:\u200a696 note 35\u200a) the cathedral. Abrahah decided to avenge this act by demolishing the Kaaba and he advanced with an army towards Mecca.:\u200a22\u201323\u200aThere were thirteen elephants in Abrahah's army:\u200a99\u200a:\u200a26\u200a and the year came to be known as '\u0100m al-F\u012bl (the Year of the Elephant), beginning a trend for reckoning the years in Arabia which was used until 'Umar ibn Al-Kha\u1e6d\u1e6d\u0101b replaced it with the Islamic Calendar in 638 CE (17 AH), with the first year of the Islamic Calendar being 622 CE.\nWhen news of the advance of Abrahah's army came, the Arab tribes of Quraysh, Kin\u0101nah, Khuz\u0101'ah and Hudhayl united in defence of the Kaaba. A man from the \u1e24imyar tribe was sent by Abrahah to advise them that he only wished to demolish the Kaaba and if they resisted, they would be crushed. \"Abdul-Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib told the Meccans to seek refuge in the nearest high hills while he, with some leading members of Quraysh, remained within the precincts of the Kaaba. Abrahah sent a dispatch inviting 'Abdul-Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib to meet him and discuss matters. When 'Abdul-Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib left the meeting he was heard saying, \"The Owner of this House is its Defender, and I am sure He will save it from the attack of the adversaries and will not dishonour the servants of His House.\":\u200a24\u201326\u200aIt is recorded that when Abrahah's forces neared the Kaaba, Allah commanded small birds (ab\u0101b\u012bl) to destroy Abrahah's army, raining down pebbles on it from their beaks. Abrahah was seriously wounded and retreated towards Yemen but died on the way.:\u200a26\u201327\u200a This event is referred to in the following Qur'anic chapter:\n\nHave you not seen how your Lord dealt with the owners of the Elephant?\nDid He not make their treacherous plan go astray?\n\nAnd He sent against them birds in flocks, striking them with stones of baked clay, so He rendered them like straw eaten up.\nMost Islamic sources place the event around the year that Muhammad was born, 570 CE, though other scholars place it one or two decades earlier. A tradition attributed to Ibn Shihab al-Zuhri in the musannaf of \u02bdAbd al-Razzaq al-San\u02bdani places it before the birth of Muhammad's father.\n\nSacrificing his son Abdullah\nAl-Harith was 'Abdul-Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib's only son at the time he dug the Zamzam Well.:\u200a64\u200a When the Quraysh tried to help him in the digging, he vowed that if he were to have ten sons to protect him, he would sacrifice one of them to Allah at the Kaaba. Later, after nine more sons had been born to him, he told them he must keep the vow. The divination arrows fell upon his favourite son Abdullah. The Quraysh protested 'Abdul-Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib's intention to sacrifice his son and demanded that he sacrifice something else instead. 'Abdul-Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib agreed to consult a \"sorceress with a familiar spirit\". She told him to cast lots between Abdullah and ten camels. If Abdullah were chosen, he had to add ten more camels, and keep on doing the same until his Lord accepted the camels in Abdullah's place. When the number of camels reached 100, the lot fell on the camels. 'Abdul-Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib confirmed this by repeating the test three times. Then the camels were sacrificed, and Abdullah was spared.:\u200a66\u201368\n\nFamily\nWives\nAbd al-Muttalib had six known wives.\n\nSumra bint Jundab of the Hawazin tribe.\nLubn\u0101 bint H\u0101jar of the Khuza'a tribe.\nFatima bint Amr of the Makhzum clan of the Quraysh tribe.\nHalah bint Wuhayb of the Zuhrah clan of the Quraysh tribe.\nNat\u012bla bint Janab of the Namir tribe.\nMumanna'a bint Amr of the Khuza'a tribe.\n\nChildren\nAccording to Ibn Hisham, \u02bfAbd al-Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib had ten sons and six daughters.:\u200a707\u2013708 note 97\u200a However, Ibn Sa'd lists twelve sons.:\u200a99\u2013101\u200aBy Sumra bint Jundab:\n\nAl-\u1e24\u0101rith.:\u200a708\u200a He was the firstborn and he died before his father.:\u200a99\u200a\nQuthum.:\u200a100\u200a He is not listed by Ibn Hisham.By Fatima bint Amr:\n\nAl-Zubayr.:\u200a707\u200a He was a poet and a chief; his father made a will in his favour.:\u200a99\u200a He died before Islam, leaving two sons and daughters.:\u200a101\u200a:\u200a34\u201335\u200a\nAbu Talib, born as Abd Manaf,:\u200a99\u200a:\u200a707\u200a father of the future Caliph Ali.

One day Muhammad's mother, Amina, wanted to go to Yathrib, where her husband, Abdullah, died. So, Muhammad, Amina, Abd al-Muttalib and their caretaker, Umm Ayman started their journey to Medina, which is around 500 kilometres away from Makkah. They stayed there for three weeks, then, started their journey back to Mecca. But, when they reached halfway, at Al-Abwa', Amina became very sick and died six years after her husband's death. She was buried over there. From then, Muhammad became an orphan. Abd al-Muttalib became very sad for Muhammad because he loved him so much. Abd al-Muttalib took care of Muhammad. But when Muhammad was eight years old, the very old Abd al-Muttalib became very sick and died at age 81-82 in 578-579 CE.\nShaybah ibn H\u0101shim's grave can be found in the Jannat al-Mu'all\u0101 cemetery in Makkah, Saudi Arabia.\n\nSee also\nFamily tree of Muhammad\nFamily tree of Shaiba ibn Hashim\nSahaba\nPassage 9:\nFred Le Deux\nFrederick David Le Deux (born 4 December 1934) is a former Australian rules footballer who played with Geelong in the Victorian Football League (VFL). He is the grandfather of Tom Hawkins.\n\nEarly life\nLe Deux grew up in Nagambie and attended Assumption College, after which he went to Bendigo to study teaching.\n\nFootball\nWhile a student at Bendigo Teachers' Training College, Le Deux played for the Sandhurst Football Club. He then moved to Ocean Grove to take up a teaching position and in 1956 joined Geelong.A follower and defender, Le Deux made 18 appearances for Geelong over three seasons, from 1956 to 1958 He was troubled by a back injury in 1958, which kept him out of the entire 1959 VFL season.In 1960 he joined Victorian Football Association club Mordialloc, as he had transferred to a local technical school.\n\nFamily\nLe Deux's daughter Jennifer was married to former Geelong player Jack Hawkins. Jennifer died in 2015. Their son, Tom Hawkins, currently plays for Geelong.\nPassage 10:\nJohn Westley\nRev. John Wesley (1636\u201378) was an English nonconformist minister. He was the grandfather of John Wesley (founder of Methodism).\n\nLife\nJohn Wesly (his own spelling), Westley, or Wesley was probably born at Bridport, Dorset, although some authorities claim he was born in Devon, the son of the Rev. Bartholomew Westley and Ann Colley, daughter of Sir Henry Colley of Carbery Castle in County Kildare, Ireland. He was educated at Dorchester Grammar School and as a student of New Inn Hall, Oxford, where he matriculated on 23 April 1651, and graduated B.A. on 23 January 1655, and M.A. on 4 July 1657. After his appointment as an evangelist, he preached at Melcombe Regis, Radipole, and other areas in Dorset. Never episcopally ordained, he was approved by Oliver Cromwell's Commission of Triers in 1658 and appointed Vicar of Winterborne Whitechurch.The report of his interview in 1661 with Gilbert Ironside the elder, his diocesan, according to Alexander Gordon writing in the Dictionary of National Biography, shows him to have been an Independent. He was imprisoned for not using the Book of Common Prayer, imprisoned again and ejected in 1662. After the Conventicle Act 1664 he continued to preach in small gatherings at Preston and then Poole, until his death at Preston in 1678.\n\nFamily\nHe married a daughter of John White, who was related also to Thomas Fuller. White, the \"Patriarch of Dorchester\", married a sister of Cornelius Burges. Westley's eldest son was Timothy (born 1659). Their second son was Rev. Samuel Wesley, a High Church Anglican vicar and the father of John and Charles Wesley. A younger son, Matthew Wesley, remained a nonconformist, became a London apothecary, and died on 10 June 1737, leaving a son, Matthew, in India; he provided for some of his brother Samuel's daughters.\n\nNotes\nAdditional sources\nMatthews, A.

{"prompt": "Answer the question based on the given passages. Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\nSatellite tournament\nA satellite tournament is either a minor tournament or event on a competitive sporting tour or one of a group of such tournaments that form a series played in the same country or region.\n\nPoker\nA satellite tournament in poker is a qualifying event. Winners of these satellites usually win the buy-in fee to a larger, more prestigious tournament like the World Series of Poker Main Event. Although there are some land-based satellite tournaments (usually for very high-stakes tournaments), most of them are online-based. Some sites, like PokerStars, maintain several tiers of satellites. A player can thus start out at one tier (not necessarily the lowest one) and play his way to a higher tier. The entry fee for each tier is always higher than the fee for the tier below it, with the first tier being the cheapest.\n\nTennis\nIn professional tennis, satellite circuits were four-week tournaments (five before 1987), typically organised by a country's national tennis association and overseen by the International Tennis Federation. They were played by players who were ranked outside the top few hundred by the Association of Tennis Professionals, with openings for unranked players in the qualifying draw. Total prize money ranged from $25,000 to $75,000 per circuit.  ATP points were awarded on the basis of a player's ranking within the circuit and from 1987 onwards on the basis of the conversion of a player's circuit points into ATP points. Players successful at this level of pro tennis would move on to play ATP Challenger Series or even top-flight ATP Tour events. The men's satellite tournaments were discontinued following the 2006 season as the circuit moved exclusively to one-week Futures tournaments.\n\nPinball\nA satellite tournament in pinball is modeled after those in poker. It is a smaller tournament that leads up to a major pinball championship, where participants have the opportunity to win their entry into the larger tournament. Applying the satellite tournament concept to pinball was first done by Northwest Pinball and Arcade Show in 2013 to promote both the show and the tournaments at the show. Since then, some other major tournaments have begun using the concept.\nPassage 2:\nTunstall, Virginia\nTunstall is an unincorporated community in New Kent County, Virginia, United States.Foster's Castle and Hampstead, both located in Tunstall, are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\nPassage 3:\nTelephone numbers in Ascension Island\nCountry Code: +247International Call Prefix: 00\nAscension Island does not share the same country code (+290) with the rest of St Helena.\n\nCalling formats\nTo call in Ascension Island, the following format is used:\nyxxxx      Calls inside Ascension Island\n+247 yxxxx  Calls from outside Ascension Island\n\nAscension Island numbering plan\nAccording to ITU Communication of 08.V.2015, Sure South Atlantic Limited, Jamestown, announced the following update to the numbering plan for Ascension.\nThe length of geographical numbers increased from four (4) to five (5) digits and prefixed with the number \"6\".\nThe 4XXXX range  reserved for mobile services.\nThe change to five-digit numbering to be implemented on 1 June 2015.   \n\n1: New 5-digit numbering\n2: 6-digit numbering\n\nSee also\nTelephone numbers in the United Kingdom\nTelephone numbers in Saint Helena and Tristan da Cunha\nPassage 4:\nLubnowy\nLubnowy is part of the name of two villages, both located in Gmina Susz, within I\u0142awa County, Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship, Poland:\n\nLubnowy Ma\u0142e\nLubnowy Wielkie\n\nSee also\nLiebenau\nPassage 5:\nBreville\nBreville is an Australian brand of small home appliances, founded in Sydney in 1932. It is best known for its home appliances, specifically blenders, coffee machines, toasters, kettles, microwaves and toaster ovens. As of 2016, the brand also manufactured \"Creatista\" coffee machines for Nespresso, and distributed other Nespresso products in Australia, New Zealand and the USA and Canada, including the \"Inissia\", \"Vertuo\" and \"Citiz\" series of machines.\n\nHistory\nIn 1932, Bill O'Brien and Harry Norville (born Charles Henry Norville) mixed their last names together and the Breville brand was created. The company started by making radios. During World War II, it made mine detectors. By 1953, the radio business had been taken over by A.W. Jackson Industries Pty. Ltd., which manufactured radiograms and, later, television sets under the Breville brand. After that, Breville turned its attention to manufacturing household appliances.\nThe O'Brien family continued developing the Breville business for three generations, with Bill's son, John, setting up the Breville Research and Development centre in the late 1960s, and his daughter, Barbara, running the marketing department throughout the 1990s. John O'Brien continued to lead many product development initiatives for the Breville brand until his death in December 2003. Breville's R&D team has taken out over 100 active patents and has been awarded more than 40 international design awards. In 1974, Breville released the toasted sandwich maker, which was a huge success, selling 400,000 units in its first year, and making the Breville brand a household name in Australia. Soon after this, the Breville toasted sandwich maker was launched in New Zealand and the United Kingdom, where it was met with similar success.\n\nOwnership\nIn 2001, the Breville companies of Australia, New Zealand, and Hong Kong transferred ownership of the brand to Housewares International Limited. The acquisition of the Breville companies caused the group to shift its focus to the electrical business and cease its Australian homewares and cleaning businesses in March 2007. In 2008, Housewares International Limited officially changed its name to the Breville Group Limited. The Breville Group Limited also owns the Kambrook and Sage brands. It markets most of its product under the Sage brand in the UK and Europe, since the Breville brand is owned by the unrelated Jarden company in the UK.\n\nGlobal presence\nBreville trades in over 70 countries including China, Brazil, South Africa, Mexico, and Israel. In 2002, the Breville brand was launched in Canada and the United States.\nPassage 6:\nJawty\nJawty (German: Jauth) is part of the name of two villages, both located in Gmina Susz, within I\u0142awa County, Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship, Poland:\n\nLubnowy Ma\u0142e\nLubnowy Wielkie\nPassage 7:\nJakab Industries\nJakab Industries was an Australian coachbuilder in Tamworth, New South Wales.\n\nHistory\nJakab Industries built its first bus body in July 1973, a Ford R226. It mainly made bodies for buses for the defence forces, but also built some for commercial operators, before withdrawing from the market in late 1995. It also built bodies for ambulances and postal vans. In the 1990s it also overhauled Mercedes-Benz and Scania buses for the State Transit Authority.\nFollowing the collapse of Clifford Corporation in 1998, Volvo arranged for Jakab to take over the Ansair plant in Tamworth and complete the work of providing Orana-style bodies for 60 State Transit Authority Volvo B10BLE buses. The subsidiary company set up to do the work was named Phoenix Bus.Jakab Industries was placed in administration in 2002.\nPassage 8:\nRadzice\nRadzice is part of the name of two villages, both located in Gmina Drzewica, within Opoczno County, \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Voivodeship, Poland:\n\nRadzice Du\u017ce\nRadzice Male\nPassage 9:\nLimestone Coast\nThe Limestone Coast is a name used since the early twenty-first century for a South Australian government region  located in the south east of South Australia which immediately adjoins the continental coastline and the Victorian border.  The name is also used for a tourist region and a wine zone both located in the same part of South Australia.\n\nExtent\nThe Limestone Coast is a South Australian Government Region which consists of land within the following local government areas located in the south east of the state: the City of Mount Gambier and the District Councils of Grant, Kingston, Robe, Tatiara and Naracoorte Lucindale and the Wattle Range Council, and the extent of \"coastal waters\" up to three nautical miles seaward of the low water mark between the border with Victoria in the east and  the northern boundary of the Kingston District Council in the north-west.\n\nIndustry regions with the same name\nLimestone Coast Tourism Region\nThe words 'Limestone Coast' also used in the name of a  tourism region which occupies a similar part of South Australia.  The tourism region consists of the following local government areas: the City of Mount Gambier, The Coorong District Council, the District Councils of Grant, Kingston, Robe, Tatiara and Naracoorte Lucindale, and the Wattle Range Council.\n\nLimestone Coast Wine Zone\nThe words 'Limestone Coast' also used in the name of a wine zone which occupies a similar part of South Australia.  The wine zone is the land south of a line located at appropriately 36 degrees 50 minutes south, i.e. in line with Cape Willoughby at the east end of Kangaroo Island.  The zone includes the following wine-growing regions: Coonawarra, Mount Benson, Mount Gambier, Padthaway, Robe and Wrattonbully.\n\nLocation and description\nFrom the Victoria border to the Younghusband Peninsula this area has been settled since colonisation by  mainly European settlers in the 1840s, displacing an indigenous population that had resided in the region for thousands of years. The region currently supports farming, viticulture, forestry and tourism. Towns include Bordertown, Keith, Millicent, Mount Gambier, Penola, and Naracoorte and the coastal resorts of Beachport, Kingston SE and Robe.\nMuch of the Limestone Coast is low-lying, and was inundated by sea as recently as 2 million years ago. It had previously also been flooded 15\u201320 million years ago.  The plains are lined by rows of low sandhills parallel to the coast, created at times when the coastline was at that level. Prior to European settlement, much of the land between the sandhills was swamp fed by streams and subject to inundation. A network of drains totalling 1450 km has been constructed to channel the water away through the sandhills to the ocean. Important areas of wetland remain including the lakes and lagoons such as the southern end of the Coorong and Bool Lagoon. Meanwhile, areas of upland in the Limestone Coast include the volcanic craters of Mount Gambier.\nThe Mediterranean climate of this coast is cool and moist with wet winters.\n\nHistory\nThere are deep limestone deposits created from the coral and other sealife. The limestone in Victoria Fossil Cave and the other Naracoorte Caves contains are Australia's biggest source of fossils and a World Heritage Site.\n\nEcology\nFlora\nThe natural vegetation was woodland of River Red gum and other eucalyptus trees.\n\nFauna\nAlthough there are few purely endemic species the coast is rich in wildlife including possums, Cercartetus pygmy possums, Petaurus Gliding possums, and other marsupials many of which do not spread further west than here. Endemic species include reptiles such as the striped legless lizard (Delma impar) and invertebrates like an endemic cave cricket. The Naracoorte caves are occupied by the common bent-wing bat.\nThe lakes and lagoons are particularly important habitats for waterbirds such as black swan, grey teal, Pacific black duck, and especially the critically endangered orange-bellied parrot (Neophema chrysogaster) which winters here along with many other birds including the red-necked stint (Calidris ruficollis), sharp-tailed sandpiper (Calidris acuminata), and curlew sandpiper (Calidris ferruginea).\nMost of the original habitat has been cleared for agriculture and only fragments remain (particularly in areas of wetland) with Coorong National Park and Canunda National Park being the largest areas. Therefore, most indigenous wildlife has also disappeared or been severely reduced in number with introduced species of animals an ongoing threat to that which remains.\n\nSee also\nRegions of South Australia\nSouth Australian Forestry Corporation\nKanawinka Geopark\n\nExternal links\n\nRegional website - local weather, street maps, events etc* Official tourist website\nSouthAustralia.com Limestone Coast - travel guides, accommodation, online booking\nLimestone Coast - National Parks\nPassage 10:\nAlexander Mathieson & Sons\nThe firm of Alexander Mathieson & Sons was one of the leading makers of hand tools in Scotland. Its success went hand in hand with the growth of the shipbuilding industries on the Firth of Clyde in the nineteenth century and the emergence of Glasgow as the \"second city of the Empire\". It also reflected the firm's skill in responding to an unprecedented demand for quality tools by shipyards, cooperages and other industries, both locally and far and wide.\n\nEarly years\nThe year 1792 was deemed by the firm to be that of its foundation; it was in all likelihood the year in which John Manners had set up his plane-making workshop on Saracen('s) Lane off the Gallowgate in the heart of Glasgow, not far from the Saracen's Head Inn, where Dr. Johnson and James Boswell had stayed on their tour of Scotland in 1773.Alexander Mathieson (1797\u20131851) is recorded in 1822 as a plane-maker at 25 Gallowgate, but in the following year at 14 Saracen's Lane, presumably having taken over the premises of John Manners. The 1841 national census described Alexander Mathieson as a master plane-maker at 38 Saracen Lane with his son Thomas Adam working as a journeyman plane-maker.\n\nThomas Adam Mathieson\nGradually business grew and became more diversified, the Post-Office Glasgow Annual Directory recording that by 1847/8 Alexander Mathieson was a \"plane, brace, bit, auger & edge-tool maker\".\n\nEdinburgh\nIn 1849 the firm of James & William Stewart at 65 Nicolson Street, Edinburgh was taken over and Thomas was put in charge of the business, trading under the name Thomas A. Mathieson & Co. as plane and edge-tool makers. Thomas's company acquired the Edinburgh edge-tool makers Charles & Hugh McPherson and took over their premises in Gilmore Street. In the Edinburgh directory of 1856/7 the business is recorded as being Alexander Mathieson & Son, plane and edge-tool makers at 48 Nicolson Street and at Paul's Work, Gilmore Street.\n\nGrowth of the Glasgow business\nThe 1851 census records that Alexander was working as a tool and plane-maker employing eight men. Later that year Alexander died and his son Thomas took over the business. Under the heading of edge-tool maker in the 1852/3 Post-Office Glasgow Annual Directory the firm is now listed as Alexander Mathieson & Son, with further lines as \"turning-lathe and vice manufacturers\" added. By the early 1850s the business had moved to 24 Saracen Lane. The directory for 1857/8 records that the firm had moved again only a few years later to East Campbell Street, also off the Gallowgate, and that through further diversification was also manufacturing coopers' and tinmen's tools. The ten-yearly censuses log the firm's growth: in 1861 Thomas was a tool manufacturer employing 95 men and 30 boys; in 1871 he had 200 men working for him; and in 1881 300 men. By 1899 the firm had been incorporated as Alexander Mathieson & Sons Ltd, notwithstanding the fact that only Alexander's son Thomas appears ever to have joined the firm.\n\nTrade-mark\nIn September 1868 Thomas Mathieson put a notice in the Sheffield & Rotherham Independent and the Sheffield Daily Telegraph stating that his firm had used the trade-mark of a crescent and star \"for some time\" and that \"using or imitating the Mark would be proceeded against for infringement\". The firm had acquired its interest in the crescent-and-star mark from the heirs of Charles Pickslay, the Sheffield cutler who had registered it with the Cutlers' Company in 1833 and had died in 1852. The year 1868 seems also to be the one in which the name Saracen Tool Works was first adopted; not only does it figure at the foot of the notice in the Sheffield press, it also makes its first appearance in the firm's entry in the Post-Office Glasgow Annual Directory in the 1868/9 edition.\n\nPublic life\nAs Thomas Mathieson's business grew, so too did his involvement in local public life and philanthropy. One of the representatives of the third ward on the town council of Glasgow, he became a river bailie in 1868, a magistrate in 1870 and a preceptor of Hutcheson's Hospital in 1878. He had a passion for books and was an \"ardent Ruskinian\". He served on the committee handling the bequest for the setting up of the Mitchell Library in Glasgow. When he died at Coulter Maynes near Biggar in 1899, he left an estate worth \u00a3142,764. He is buried at the Glasgow Necropolis next to the cathedral.\n\nLater years of the firm\nBoth Thomas's sons, James Harper and Thomas Ogilvie, were involved in the continuing life of the firm. James followed in his father's footsteps in becoming a local public figure. He was appointed Deputy Lieutenant of the County of the City of Glasgow and was made a deacon of the Incorporation of the Hammermen of Glasgow in 1919. His brother Thomas Ogilvie was recorded as tool manufacturer and employer in the 1911 census. Thomas Ogilvie's son Thomas Alastair Sutherland Ogilvie \"Taso\" Mathieson born in 1908 took a rather different approach to engineering, however, by becoming a racing driver. In 1947 he wed the French film actress Mila Par\u00e9ly.\n\nAwards at world's fairs\nGreat Exhibition, London, 1851.

Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nQuestion: Are Breville and Jakab Industries both located in the same country?\nAnswer:", "input": "Are Breville and Jakab Industries both located in the same country?", "context": "Passage 1:\nSatellite tournament\nA satellite tournament is either a minor tournament or event on a competitive sporting tour or one of a group of such tournaments that form a series played in the same country or region.\n\nPoker\nA satellite tournament in poker is a qualifying event. Winners of these satellites usually win the buy-in fee to a larger, more prestigious tournament like the World Series of Poker Main Event. Although there are some land-based satellite tournaments (usually for very high-stakes tournaments), most of them are online-based. Some sites, like PokerStars, maintain several tiers of satellites. A player can thus start out at one tier (not necessarily the lowest one) and play his way to a higher tier. The entry fee for each tier is always higher than the fee for the tier below it, with the first tier being the cheapest.\n\nTennis\nIn professional tennis, satellite circuits were four-week tournaments (five before 1987), typically organised by a country's national tennis association and overseen by the International Tennis Federation. They were played by players who were ranked outside the top few hundred by the Association of Tennis Professionals, with openings for unranked players in the qualifying draw. Total prize money ranged from $25,000 to $75,000 per circuit.  ATP points were awarded on the basis of a player's ranking within the circuit and from 1987 onwards on the basis of the conversion of a player's circuit points into ATP points. Players successful at this level of pro tennis would move on to play ATP Challenger Series or even top-flight ATP Tour events. The men's satellite tournaments were discontinued following the 2006 season as the circuit moved exclusively to one-week Futures tournaments.\n\nPinball\nA satellite tournament in pinball is modeled after those in poker. It is a smaller tournament that leads up to a major pinball championship, where participants have the opportunity to win their entry into the larger tournament. Applying the satellite tournament concept to pinball was first done by Northwest Pinball and Arcade Show in 2013 to promote both the show and the tournaments at the show. Since then, some other major tournaments have begun using the concept.\nPassage 2:\nTunstall, Virginia\nTunstall is an unincorporated community in New Kent County, Virginia, United States.Foster's Castle and Hampstead, both located in Tunstall, are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\nPassage 3:\nTelephone numbers in Ascension Island\nCountry Code: +247International Call Prefix: 00\nAscension Island does not share the same country code (+290) with the rest of St Helena.\n\nCalling formats\nTo call in Ascension Island, the following format is used:\nyxxxx      Calls inside Ascension Island\n+247 yxxxx  Calls from outside Ascension Island\n\nAscension Island numbering plan\nAccording to ITU Communication of 08.V.2015, Sure South Atlantic Limited, Jamestown, announced the following update to the numbering plan for Ascension.\nThe length of geographical numbers increased from four (4) to five (5) digits and prefixed with the number \"6\".\nThe 4XXXX range  reserved for mobile services.\nThe change to five-digit numbering to be implemented on 1 June 2015.   \n\n1: New 5-digit numbering\n2: 6-digit numbering\n\nSee also\nTelephone numbers in the United Kingdom\nTelephone numbers in Saint Helena and Tristan da Cunha\nPassage 4:\nLubnowy\nLubnowy is part of the name of two villages, both located in Gmina Susz, within I\u0142awa County, Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship, Poland:\n\nLubnowy Ma\u0142e\nLubnowy Wielkie\n\nSee also\nLiebenau\nPassage 5:\nBreville\nBreville is an Australian brand of small home appliances, founded in Sydney in 1932. It is best known for its home appliances, specifically blenders, coffee machines, toasters, kettles, microwaves and toaster ovens. As of 2016, the brand also manufactured \"Creatista\" coffee machines for Nespresso, and distributed other Nespresso products in Australia, New Zealand and the USA and Canada, including the \"Inissia\", \"Vertuo\" and \"Citiz\" series of machines.\n\nHistory\nIn 1932, Bill O'Brien and Harry Norville (born Charles Henry Norville) mixed their last names together and the Breville brand was created. The company started by making radios. During World War II, it made mine detectors. By 1953, the radio business had been taken over by A.W. Jackson Industries Pty. Ltd., which manufactured radiograms and, later, television sets under the Breville brand. After that, Breville turned its attention to manufacturing household appliances.\nThe O'Brien family continued developing the Breville business for three generations, with Bill's son, John, setting up the Breville Research and Development centre in the late 1960s, and his daughter, Barbara, running the marketing department throughout the 1990s. John O'Brien continued to lead many product development initiatives for the Breville brand until his death in December 2003. Breville's R&D team has taken out over 100 active patents and has been awarded more than 40 international design awards. In 1974, Breville released the toasted sandwich maker, which was a huge success, selling 400,000 units in its first year, and making the Breville brand a household name in Australia. Soon after this, the Breville toasted sandwich maker was launched in New Zealand and the United Kingdom, where it was met with similar success.\n\nOwnership\nIn 2001, the Breville companies of Australia, New Zealand, and Hong Kong transferred ownership of the brand to Housewares International Limited. The acquisition of the Breville companies caused the group to shift its focus to the electrical business and cease its Australian homewares and cleaning businesses in March 2007. In 2008, Housewares International Limited officially changed its name to the Breville Group Limited. The Breville Group Limited also owns the Kambrook and Sage brands. It markets most of its product under the Sage brand in the UK and Europe, since the Breville brand is owned by the unrelated Jarden company in the UK.\n\nGlobal presence\nBreville trades in over 70 countries including China, Brazil, South Africa, Mexico, and Israel. In 2002, the Breville brand was launched in Canada and the United States.\nPassage 6:\nJawty\nJawty (German: Jauth) is part of the name of two villages, both located in Gmina Susz, within I\u0142awa County, Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship, Poland:\n\nLubnowy Ma\u0142e\nLubnowy Wielkie\nPassage 7:\nJakab Industries\nJakab Industries was an Australian coachbuilder in Tamworth, New South Wales.\n\nHistory\nJakab Industries built its first bus body in July 1973, a Ford R226. It mainly made bodies for buses for the defence forces, but also built some for commercial operators, before withdrawing from the market in late 1995. It also built bodies for ambulances and postal vans. In the 1990s it also overhauled Mercedes-Benz and Scania buses for the State Transit Authority.\nFollowing the collapse of Clifford Corporation in 1998, Volvo arranged for Jakab to take over the Ansair plant in Tamworth and complete the work of providing Orana-style bodies for 60 State Transit Authority Volvo B10BLE buses. The subsidiary company set up to do the work was named Phoenix Bus.Jakab Industries was placed in administration in 2002.\nPassage 8:\nRadzice\nRadzice is part of the name of two villages, both located in Gmina Drzewica, within Opoczno County, \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Voivodeship, Poland:\n\nRadzice Du\u017ce\nRadzice Male\nPassage 9:\nLimestone Coast\nThe Limestone Coast is a name used since the early twenty-first century for a South Australian government region  located in the south east of South Australia which immediately adjoins the continental coastline and the Victorian border.  The name is also used for a tourist region and a wine zone both located in the same part of South Australia.\n\nExtent\nThe Limestone Coast is a South Australian Government Region which consists of land within the following local government areas located in the south east of the state: the City of Mount Gambier and the District Councils of Grant, Kingston, Robe, Tatiara and Naracoorte Lucindale and the Wattle Range Council, and the extent of \"coastal waters\" up to three nautical miles seaward of the low water mark between the border with Victoria in the east and  the northern boundary of the Kingston District Council in the north-west.\n\nIndustry regions with the same name\nLimestone Coast Tourism Region\nThe words 'Limestone Coast' also used in the name of a  tourism region which occupies a similar part of South Australia.  The tourism region consists of the following local government areas: the City of Mount Gambier, The Coorong District Council, the District Councils of Grant, Kingston, Robe, Tatiara and Naracoorte Lucindale, and the Wattle Range Council.\n\nLimestone Coast Wine Zone\nThe words 'Limestone Coast' also used in the name of a wine zone which occupies a similar part of South Australia.  The wine zone is the land south of a line located at appropriately 36 degrees 50 minutes south, i.e. in line with Cape Willoughby at the east end of Kangaroo Island.  The zone includes the following wine-growing regions: Coonawarra, Mount Benson, Mount Gambier, Padthaway, Robe and Wrattonbully.\n\nLocation and description\nFrom the Victoria border to the Younghusband Peninsula this area has been settled since colonisation by  mainly European settlers in the 1840s, displacing an indigenous population that had resided in the region for thousands of years. The region currently supports farming, viticulture, forestry and tourism. Towns include Bordertown, Keith, Millicent, Mount Gambier, Penola, and Naracoorte and the coastal resorts of Beachport, Kingston SE and Robe.\nMuch of the Limestone Coast is low-lying, and was inundated by sea as recently as 2 million years ago. It had previously also been flooded 15\u201320 million years ago.  The plains are lined by rows of low sandhills parallel to the coast, created at times when the coastline was at that level. Prior to European settlement, much of the land between the sandhills was swamp fed by streams and subject to inundation. A network of drains totalling 1450 km has been constructed to channel the water away through the sandhills to the ocean. Important areas of wetland remain including the lakes and lagoons such as the southern end of the Coorong and Bool Lagoon. Meanwhile, areas of upland in the Limestone Coast include the volcanic craters of Mount Gambier.\nThe Mediterranean climate of this coast is cool and moist with wet winters.\n\nHistory\nThere are deep limestone deposits created from the coral and other sealife. The limestone in Victoria Fossil Cave and the other Naracoorte Caves contains are Australia's biggest source of fossils and a World Heritage Site.\n\nEcology\nFlora\nThe natural vegetation was woodland of River Red gum and other eucalyptus trees.\n\nFauna\nAlthough there are few purely endemic species the coast is rich in wildlife including possums, Cercartetus pygmy possums, Petaurus Gliding possums, and other marsupials many of which do not spread further west than here. Endemic species include reptiles such as the striped legless lizard (Delma impar) and invertebrates like an endemic cave cricket. The Naracoorte caves are occupied by the common bent-wing bat.\nThe lakes and lagoons are particularly important habitats for waterbirds such as black swan, grey teal, Pacific black duck, and especially the critically endangered orange-bellied parrot (Neophema chrysogaster) which winters here along with many other birds including the red-necked stint (Calidris ruficollis), sharp-tailed sandpiper (Calidris acuminata), and curlew sandpiper (Calidris ferruginea).\nMost of the original habitat has been cleared for agriculture and only fragments remain (particularly in areas of wetland) with Coorong National Park and Canunda National Park being the largest areas. Therefore, most indigenous wildlife has also disappeared or been severely reduced in number with introduced species of animals an ongoing threat to that which remains.\n\nSee also\nRegions of South Australia\nSouth Australian Forestry Corporation\nKanawinka Geopark\n\nExternal links\n\nRegional website - local weather, street maps, events etc* Official tourist website\nSouthAustralia.com Limestone Coast - travel guides, accommodation, online booking\nLimestone Coast - National Parks\nPassage 10:\nAlexander Mathieson & Sons\nThe firm of Alexander Mathieson & Sons was one of the leading makers of hand tools in Scotland. Its success went hand in hand with the growth of the shipbuilding industries on the Firth of Clyde in the nineteenth century and the emergence of Glasgow as the \"second city of the Empire\". It also reflected the firm's skill in responding to an unprecedented demand for quality tools by shipyards, cooperages and other industries, both locally and far and wide.\n\nEarly years\nThe year 1792 was deemed by the firm to be that of its foundation; it was in all likelihood the year in which John Manners had set up his plane-making workshop on Saracen('s) Lane off the Gallowgate in the heart of Glasgow, not far from the Saracen's Head Inn, where Dr. Johnson and James Boswell had stayed on their tour of Scotland in 1773.Alexander Mathieson (1797\u20131851) is recorded in 1822 as a plane-maker at 25 Gallowgate, but in the following year at 14 Saracen's Lane, presumably having taken over the premises of John Manners. The 1841 national census described Alexander Mathieson as a master plane-maker at 38 Saracen Lane with his son Thomas Adam working as a journeyman plane-maker.\n\nThomas Adam Mathieson\nGradually business grew and became more diversified, the Post-Office Glasgow Annual Directory recording that by 1847/8 Alexander Mathieson was a \"plane, brace, bit, auger & edge-tool maker\".\n\nEdinburgh\nIn 1849 the firm of James & William Stewart at 65 Nicolson Street, Edinburgh was taken over and Thomas was put in charge of the business, trading under the name Thomas A. Mathieson & Co. as plane and edge-tool makers. Thomas's company acquired the Edinburgh edge-tool makers Charles & Hugh McPherson and took over their premises in Gilmore Street. In the Edinburgh directory of 1856/7 the business is recorded as being Alexander Mathieson & Son, plane and edge-tool makers at 48 Nicolson Street and at Paul's Work, Gilmore Street.\n\nGrowth of the Glasgow business\nThe 1851 census records that Alexander was working as a tool and plane-maker employing eight men. Later that year Alexander died and his son Thomas took over the business. Under the heading of edge-tool maker in the 1852/3 Post-Office Glasgow Annual Directory the firm is now listed as Alexander Mathieson & Son, with further lines as \"turning-lathe and vice manufacturers\" added. By the early 1850s the business had moved to 24 Saracen Lane. The directory for 1857/8 records that the firm had moved again only a few years later to East Campbell Street, also off the Gallowgate, and that through further diversification was also manufacturing coopers' and tinmen's tools.

By 1899 the firm had been incorporated as Alexander Mathieson & Sons Ltd, notwithstanding the fact that only Alexander's son Thomas appears ever to have joined the firm.\n\nTrade-mark\nIn September 1868 Thomas Mathieson put a notice in the Sheffield & Rotherham Independent and the Sheffield Daily Telegraph stating that his firm had used the trade-mark of a crescent and star \"for some time\" and that \"using or imitating the Mark would be proceeded against for infringement\". The firm had acquired its interest in the crescent-and-star mark from the heirs of Charles Pickslay, the Sheffield cutler who had registered it with the Cutlers' Company in 1833 and had died in 1852. The year 1868 seems also to be the one in which the name Saracen Tool Works was first adopted; not only does it figure at the foot of the notice in the Sheffield press, it also makes its first appearance in the firm's entry in the Post-Office Glasgow Annual Directory in the 1868/9 edition.\n\nPublic life\nAs Thomas Mathieson's business grew, so too did his involvement in local public life and philanthropy. One of the representatives of the third ward on the town council of Glasgow, he became a river bailie in 1868, a magistrate in 1870 and a preceptor of Hutcheson's Hospital in 1878. He had a passion for books and was an \"ardent Ruskinian\". He served on the committee handling the bequest for the setting up of the Mitchell Library in Glasgow. When he died at Coulter Maynes near Biggar in 1899, he left an estate worth \u00a3142,764. He is buried at the Glasgow Necropolis next to the cathedral.\n\nLater years of the firm\nBoth Thomas's sons, James Harper and Thomas Ogilvie, were involved in the continuing life of the firm. James followed in his father's footsteps in becoming a local public figure. He was appointed Deputy Lieutenant of the County of the City of Glasgow and was made a deacon of the Incorporation of the Hammermen of Glasgow in 1919.

It was written by Val Valentine and J. B. Williams with uncredited assistance from Frank Launder. It was produced by Edward Black. The film's sets were designed by Walter Murton.\n\nPlot\nIt is April, 1942. Lieutenant Freddie Taylor and some crew of the submarine Sea Tiger are given a week's leave after an unsuccessful patrol. Leading Seaman Hobson goes home to save his marriage, while a reluctant Torpedo Gunner's Mate Corrigan departs for his wedding in London. When the crew are recalled early Corrigan is relieved, though later regrets not completing his marriage. Sea Tiger has been assigned the top secret mission to sink Nazi Germany's new battleship, the Brandenburg, before she transits the Kiel Canal for sea trials in the Baltic Sea. Sea Tiger must put to sea immediately.\nCrossing the North Sea, the submarine picks up three shot-down Luftwaffe pilots from a rescue buoy, and prevents their radio alert to German forces. When the submarine enters a minefield, an airman panics and reveals the Brandenburg is further ahead than thought. The airman is attacked by a countryman and subsequently dies. Taylor decides on a desperate gamble to pursue the Brandenburg into the German-controlled Baltic Sea.\nWhen the Brandenburg is spotted, Sea Tiger fires all its torpedoes, but dives before assessing their impact due to German destroyers dropping depth charges. By expelling oil and other debris including the body of the German airman, Taylor deceives the Germans into believing that the submarine has sunk. Although successfully escaped, Sea Tiger no longer has enough oil to reach Britain. The Germans, convinced that the Sea Tiger has been sunk, have Lord Haw Haw broadcast to Britain announcing the destruction of the Sea Tiger.\nTaylor decides to have his crew abandon ship on the Danish island of H\u00e5g\u00f8 (which is in fact the island of B\u00e5g\u00f8). Hobson, a former merchant seaman who speaks German and knows the port on the island, persuades Taylor to let him go ashore and search for oil. He succeeds, and Sea Tiger enters the harbour under cover of darkness, using Hobson's intelligence about the harbour depth. Aided by friendly Danish sailors, they refuel while Hobson and other crewmen hold off the German garrison. Although Pincher (the cook) is killed and Oxford and Lieutenant Johnson are wounded, they get back to the re-fuelled submarine and start to leave the port. While they leave though, the tanker they were able to refuel from is hit by German shells and catches fire. Taylor, not wanting to risk the Sea Tiger any longer, continues to leave the port and makes it out to the open sea.\nWhile returning to Britain, the crew are met by an escorting trawler and learn from them that they sank the Brandenburg. The Sea Tiger returns to base, flying the Jolly Roger for the first time.\n\nCast\nJohn Mills as Lieutenant Freddie Taylor, Captain\nLouis Bradfield as Lieutenant Brace, First Officer\nRonald Millar as Lieutenant Ronnie Johnson, Third Officer\nJack Watling as Lieutenant Gordon, Navigating Officer\nReginald Purdell as C/P.O.

John Mills prepared for his role as the captain of Sea Tiger by sailing in a submarine on a training mission down the Clyde. He recalled a crash dive: The ship then seemed to stand on her nose and I felt her speeding like an arrow towards the sea bed; charts and crockery went flying in all directions; I hung on to a rail near the periscope trying to look heroic and totally unconcerned; the only thing that concerned me was the fact that I was sure that my face had turned a pale shade of pea-green.\nExterior shots of the submarines P614 and P615 were used for Sea Tiger (with the final number painted over to make \"P61\"). The vessels were a Turkish S-class submarine that had been part of a consignment ordered by the Turkish Navy from the British company Vickers in 1939. But with the outbreak of World War II, the four boats were requisitioned by the Royal Navy and designated the P611 class in the British Fleet. They were similar in design but slightly smaller than the British S class, although with a higher conning tower. The S-class boat HMS Safari also appears in the film.\n\nHome media\nThe film has been issued on VHS by Madacy Records and Timeless Multimedia among others, and on DVD by ITV DVD and Carlton.\nPassage 3:\nConey Island Baby (film)\nConey Island Baby is a 2003 comedy-drama in which film producer Amy Hobby made her directorial debut.

She was built in 1911 and originally christened Chenab for the Nourse Line of London.\nIn 1930 the ship was sold to Khedivial Mail Steamship & Graving Dock and renamed Ville De Beyrouth. In 1939 the ship was sold again and renamed Al Rawdah.\nIn 1940 the British Ministry of Shipping requisitioned the vessel and she was managed by the British-India Steam Navigation Company Ltd. In 1946 Al Rawdah was returned to her owners, and scrapped in 1953.\n\nInternment\nBetween 1940 and 1946 the vessel (described as a \"hulk\") was used as a military base and prison ship for Irish Republican internees and prisoners. Internment on the Al Rawdah began in 1939 as it was moored just off Killyleagh in Strangford Lough. Conditions on board the ageing ship were not good - food was described as \"abominable\" by survivors. Internees were packed in \"bronchitic squalor\" for months or years.

The low-quality special effects, the non-existent acting, the bad dubbing, and the chaotic plotting and pacing were all of a piece with what critics had been saying, erroneously, about the Godzilla movies for years.\" The review referred to the film's \"cheesy special effects and ridiculous dialogue taking on a sort of so-bad-they're-good charm\", and described the film as a \"thoroughly memorable (if not necessarily enjoyable, outside of the MST3K continuum) specimen of bad cinema.\"On October 11, 1997 the film was shown on the movie-mocking television show Mystery Science Theater 3000. In his review of the film, Bruce Eder of AllMovie described the episode as a memorable one, specifically the cast watching the repetitive aerial dogfights between spaceships, and one of the hosts remarking that \"Independence Day seems a richly nuanced movie\". Criticism of the film included excessive use of WWII stock footage in the action scenes (especially the obviously noticeable shot featuring a picture of Adolf Hitler in one building).In his book Japanese Science Fiction, Fantasy and Horror Films, Stuart Galbraith IV stated that the film \"had a few surprises\" despite a \"woefully familiar script\". Galbraith noted that the film was not as over-the-top as Prince of Space and that the opticals in the film were as strong as anything Toho had produced at the time.

It was written by Val Valentine and J. B. Williams with uncredited assistance from Frank Launder. It was produced by Edward Black. The film's sets were designed by Walter Murton.\n\nPlot\nIt is April, 1942. Lieutenant Freddie Taylor and some crew of the submarine Sea Tiger are given a week's leave after an unsuccessful patrol. Leading Seaman Hobson goes home to save his marriage, while a reluctant Torpedo Gunner's Mate Corrigan departs for his wedding in London. When the crew are recalled early Corrigan is relieved, though later regrets not completing his marriage. Sea Tiger has been assigned the top secret mission to sink Nazi Germany's new battleship, the Brandenburg, before she transits the Kiel Canal for sea trials in the Baltic Sea. Sea Tiger must put to sea immediately.\nCrossing the North Sea, the submarine picks up three shot-down Luftwaffe pilots from a rescue buoy, and prevents their radio alert to German forces. When the submarine enters a minefield, an airman panics and reveals the Brandenburg is further ahead than thought. The airman is attacked by a countryman and subsequently dies. Taylor decides on a desperate gamble to pursue the Brandenburg into the German-controlled Baltic Sea.\nWhen the Brandenburg is spotted, Sea Tiger fires all its torpedoes, but dives before assessing their impact due to German destroyers dropping depth charges. By expelling oil and other debris including the body of the German airman, Taylor deceives the Germans into believing that the submarine has sunk. Although successfully escaped, Sea Tiger no longer has enough oil to reach Britain. The Germans, convinced that the Sea Tiger has been sunk, have Lord Haw Haw broadcast to Britain announcing the destruction of the Sea Tiger.\nTaylor decides to have his crew abandon ship on the Danish island of H\u00e5g\u00f8 (which is in fact the island of B\u00e5g\u00f8). Hobson, a former merchant seaman who speaks German and knows the port on the island, persuades Taylor to let him go ashore and search for oil. He succeeds, and Sea Tiger enters the harbour under cover of darkness, using Hobson's intelligence about the harbour depth. Aided by friendly Danish sailors, they refuel while Hobson and other crewmen hold off the German garrison. Although Pincher (the cook) is killed and Oxford and Lieutenant Johnson are wounded, they get back to the re-fuelled submarine and start to leave the port. While they leave though, the tanker they were able to refuel from is hit by German shells and catches fire. Taylor, not wanting to risk the Sea Tiger any longer, continues to leave the port and makes it out to the open sea.\nWhile returning to Britain, the crew are met by an escorting trawler and learn from them that they sank the Brandenburg. The Sea Tiger returns to base, flying the Jolly Roger for the first time.\n\nCast\nJohn Mills as Lieutenant Freddie Taylor, Captain\nLouis Bradfield as Lieutenant Brace, First Officer\nRonald Millar as Lieutenant Ronnie Johnson, Third Officer\nJack Watling as Lieutenant Gordon, Navigating Officer\nReginald Purdell as C/P.O.

John Mills prepared for his role as the captain of Sea Tiger by sailing in a submarine on a training mission down the Clyde. He recalled a crash dive: The ship then seemed to stand on her nose and I felt her speeding like an arrow towards the sea bed; charts and crockery went flying in all directions; I hung on to a rail near the periscope trying to look heroic and totally unconcerned; the only thing that concerned me was the fact that I was sure that my face had turned a pale shade of pea-green.\nExterior shots of the submarines P614 and P615 were used for Sea Tiger (with the final number painted over to make \"P61\"). The vessels were a Turkish S-class submarine that had been part of a consignment ordered by the Turkish Navy from the British company Vickers in 1939. But with the outbreak of World War II, the four boats were requisitioned by the Royal Navy and designated the P611 class in the British Fleet. They were similar in design but slightly smaller than the British S class, although with a higher conning tower. The S-class boat HMS Safari also appears in the film.\n\nHome media\nThe film has been issued on VHS by Madacy Records and Timeless Multimedia among others, and on DVD by ITV DVD and Carlton.\nPassage 3:\nConey Island Baby (film)\nConey Island Baby is a 2003 comedy-drama in which film producer Amy Hobby made her directorial debut.

He was the director of the Peabody Essex Museum in Salem for 17 months, resigning December 31, 2020. He was the director of the Toledo Museum of Art in Ohio from 2010 to 2019. He was the director of the Hood Museum of Art from 2005 to 2010, and the National Gallery of Australia (Canberra) from 1997 to 2004.\n\nCareer\nBrian Kennedy currently lives and works in the United States after leaving Australia in 2005 to direct the Hood Museum of Art at Dartmouth College. In October 2010 he became the ninth Director of the Toledo Museum of Art. On 1 July 2019, he succeeded Dan Monroe as the executive director and CEO of the Peabody Essex Museum.\n\nEarly life and career in Ireland\nKennedy was born in Dublin and attended Clonkeen College. He received B.A. (1982), M.A. (1985) and PhD (1989) degrees from University College-Dublin, where he studied both art history and history.\nHe worked in the Irish Department of Education (1982), the European Commission, Brussels (1983), and in Ireland at the Chester Beatty Library (1983\u201385), Government Publications Office (1985\u201386), and Department of Finance (1986\u201389). He married Mary Fiona Carlin in 1988.He was Assistant Director at the National Gallery of Ireland in Dublin from 1989 to 1997. He was Chair of the Irish Association of Art Historians from 1996 to 1997, and of the Council of Australian Art Museum Directors from 2001 to 2003. In September 1997 he became Director of the National Gallery of Australia.\n\nNational Gallery of Australia (NGA)\nKennedy expanded the traveling exhibitions and loans program throughout Australia, arranged for several major shows of Australian art abroad, increased the number of exhibitions at the museum itself and oversaw the development of an extensive multi-media site.  Although he oversaw several years of the museum's highest ever annual visitation, he discontinued the emphasis of his predecessor, Betty Churcher, on showing \"blockbuster\" exhibitions.\nDuring his directorship, the NGA gained government support for improving the building and significant private donations and corporate sponsorship. However, the initial design for the building proved controversial generating a public dispute with the original architect on moral rights grounds.  As a result, the project was not delivered during Dr Kennedy's tenure, with a significantly altered design completed some years later.  Private funding supported two acquisitions of British art, including David Hockney's A Bigger Grand Canyon in 1999, and Lucian Freud's After C\u00e9zanne in 2001. Kennedy built on the established collections at the museum by acquiring the Holmgren-Spertus collection of Indonesian textiles; the Kenneth Tyler collection of editioned prints, screens, multiples and unique proofs; and the Australian Print Workshop Archive. He was also notable for campaigning for the construction of a new \"front\" entrance to the Gallery, facing King Edward Terrace, which was completed in 2010 (see reference to the building project above).\nKennedy's cancellation of the \"Sensation exhibition\" (scheduled at the NGA from 2 June 2000 to 13 August 2000) was controversial, and seen by some as censorship. He claimed that the decision was due to the exhibition being \"too close to the market\" implying that a national cultural institution cannot exhibit the private collection of a speculative art investor. However, there were other exhibitions at the NGA during his tenure, which could have raised similar concerns. The exhibition featured the privately owned Young British Artists works belonging to Charles Saatchi and attracted large attendances in London and Brooklyn. Its most controversial work was Chris Ofili's The Holy Virgin Mary, a painting which used elephant dung and was accused of being blasphemous. The then-mayor of New York, Rudolph Giuliani, campaigned against the exhibition, claiming it was \"Catholic-bashing\" and an \"aggressive, vicious, disgusting attack on religion.\" In November 1999, Kennedy cancelled the exhibition and stated that the events in New York had \"obscured discussion of the artistic merit of the works of art\". He has said that it \"was the toughest decision of my professional life, so far.\"Kennedy was also repeatedly questioned on his management of a range of issues during the Australian Government's Senate Estimates process - particularly on the NGA's occupational health and safety record and concerns about the NGA's twenty-year-old air-conditioning system. The air-conditioning was finally renovated in 2003.

The museum offers free admission and is recognized for its historical leadership in the field of art education.  During his tenure, Kennedy has focused the museum's art education efforts on visual literacy, which he defines as \"learning to read, understand and write visual language.\"   Initiatives have included baby and toddler tours, specialized training for all staff, docents, volunteers and the launch of a website, www.vislit.org. In November 2014, the museum hosted the International Visual Literacy Association (IVLA) conference, the first Museum to do so. Kennedy has been a frequent speaker on the topic, including 2010 and 2013 TEDx talks on visual and sensory literacy.\nKennedy has expressed an interest in expanding the museum's collection of contemporary art and art by indigenous peoples. Works by Frank Stella, Sean Scully, Jaume Plensa, Ravinder Reddy and Mary Sibande have been acquired.  In addition, the museum has made major acquisitions of Old Master paintings by Frans Hals and Luca Giordano.During his tenure the Toledo Museum of Art has announced the return of several objects from its collection due to claims the objects were stolen and/or illegally exported prior being sold to the museum.  In 2011 a Meissen sweetmeat stand was returned to Germany followed by an Etruscan Kalpis or water jug to Italy (2013), an Indian sculpture of Ganesha (2014) and an astrological compendium to Germany in 2015.\n\nHood Museum of Art\nKennedy became Director of the Hood Museum of Art in July 2005. During his tenure, he implemented a series of large and small-scale exhibitions and oversaw the production of more than 20 publications to bring greater public attention to the museum's remarkable collections of the arts of America, Europe, Africa, Papua New Guinea and the Polar regions. At 70,000 objects, the Hood has one of the largest collections on any American college of university campus. The exhibition, Black Womanhood: Images, Icons, and Ideologies of the African Body, toured several US venues.

Kennedy announced in 2002 that he would not seek extension of his contract beyond 2004, accepting a seven-year term as had his two predecessors.He became a joint Irish-Australian citizen in 2003.\n\nToledo Museum of Art\nThe Toledo Museum of Art is known for its exceptional collections of European and American paintings and sculpture, glass, antiquities, artist books, Japanese prints and netsuke. The museum offers free admission and is recognized for its historical leadership in the field of art education.  During his tenure, Kennedy has focused the museum's art education efforts on visual literacy, which he defines as \"learning to read, understand and write visual language.\"   Initiatives have included baby and toddler tours, specialized training for all staff, docents, volunteers and the launch of a website, www.vislit.org. In November 2014, the museum hosted the International Visual Literacy Association (IVLA) conference, the first Museum to do so. Kennedy has been a frequent speaker on the topic, including 2010 and 2013 TEDx talks on visual and sensory literacy.\nKennedy has expressed an interest in expanding the museum's collection of contemporary art and art by indigenous peoples. Works by Frank Stella, Sean Scully, Jaume Plensa, Ravinder Reddy and Mary Sibande have been acquired.  In addition, the museum has made major acquisitions of Old Master paintings by Frans Hals and Luca Giordano.During his tenure the Toledo Museum of Art has announced the return of several objects from its collection due to claims the objects were stolen and/or illegally exported prior being sold to the museum.  In 2011 a Meissen sweetmeat stand was returned to Germany followed by an Etruscan Kalpis or water jug to Italy (2013), an Indian sculpture of Ganesha (2014) and an astrological compendium to Germany in 2015.\n\nHood Museum of Art\nKennedy became Director of the Hood Museum of Art in July 2005. During his tenure, he implemented a series of large and small-scale exhibitions and oversaw the production of more than 20 publications to bring greater public attention to the museum's remarkable collections of the arts of America, Europe, Africa, Papua New Guinea and the Polar regions. At 70,000 objects, the Hood has one of the largest collections on any American college of university campus. The exhibition, Black Womanhood: Images, Icons, and Ideologies of the African Body, toured several US venues. Kennedy increased campus curricular use of works of art, with thousands of objects pulled from storage for classes annually. Numerous acquisitions were made with the museum's generous endowments, and he curated several exhibitions: including Wenda Gu: Forest of Stone Steles: Retranslation and Rewriting Tang Dynasty Poetry, Sean Scully: The Art of the Stripe, and Frank Stella: Irregular Polygons.\n\nPublications\nKennedy has written or edited a number of books on art, including:\n\nAlfred Chester Beatty and Ireland 1950-1968: A study in cultural politics, Glendale Press (1988), ISBN 978-0-907606-49-9\nDreams and responsibilities: The state and arts in independent Ireland, Arts Council of Ireland (1990), ISBN 978-0-906627-32-7\nJack B Yeats: Jack Butler Yeats, 1871-1957 (Lives of Irish Artists), Unipub (October 1991), ISBN 978-0-948524-24-0\nThe Anatomy Lesson: Art and Medicine (with Davis Coakley), National Gallery of Ireland (January 1992), ISBN 978-0-903162-65-4\nIreland: Art into History (with Raymond Gillespie), Roberts Rinehart Publishers (1994), ISBN 978-1-57098-005-3\nIrish Painting, Roberts Rinehart Publishers (November 1997),  ISBN 978-1-86059-059-7\nSean Scully: The Art of the Stripe, Hood Museum of Art (October 2008), ISBN 978-0-944722-34-3\nFrank Stella: Irregular Polygons, 1965-1966, Hood Museum of Art (October 2010), ISBN 978-0-944722-39-8\n\nHonors and achievements\nKennedy was awarded the Australian Centenary Medal in 2001 for service to Australian Society and its art.

Davis. It was filmed at Mamaroneck Harbor in Mamaroneck, NY.\n\nPlot and critical response\nTime magazine:\n\nAn extremely funny 15-minute film, may be taken as a solemn leg-pull of the recent vogue for dribble-and-splotch painters, those athletic canvas-coverers whose style owes less to Van Gogh's brush technique than to Stan Laurel's custard pie stance.  Or it may be taken as an explicit set of instructions for getting rich.\n\nThe film, a first-time effort by three ex-admen, begins with a loving shot of wharfs, fishing shacks and sounding sea-the sort of vista once sketched avidly by artists and now appreciated chiefly by retired couples who tour Cape Cod in late September.  The artist is a burly fellow (Ezra Reuben Baker), recognizably aesthetic in paint-smeared dungarees, scurrilous red sweater and combat boots.  He trundles a cart filled with paint buckets along a dock, then throws an enormous sheet of wallboard down on a mud flat ten feet below.\n\nSoberly, with exquisite skill, using first a vigorous forehand, then a precisely executed backhand, the painter slops color from buckets.  Clearly he is a master, for his stroke with the long-handled hoe is sure and strong, his touch with the dribble-stick more than Japanese in its delicacy.  And when he fills a flare pistol with paint and fires the last accent of orange at his abstraction, he does not pull the trigger.  He squeezes.\n\nWhen the thing dries, he hacks it up in random rectangles with a power saw, then carefully signs each fragment.  A seaplane, labeled \"Galerie des Abstracts, Paris-New York,\" touches down.  A man debarks whose rich, dark overcoat obviously proclaims him an art dealer.  He strokes his jaw as he examines the paintings, eventually selects a small one, shakes hands with the painter and takes off.  Pleased with himself, the painter matter-of-factly shoves the remaining works of art into the ocean.  This, as the screen truly proclaims, is the end.\nNew York Herald Tribune:\n\nA hilarious good - natured spoof of abstract-expressionist painting has been made the subject of a colored film-short called \"Day of the Painter.\" .........Without sound or sub-titles (except for a delightful musical score somewhat reminiscent of that which accompanied the Alex Guinness film, \"The Horse's Mouth\") the film begins with the artist's awakening in a crumbling shack on a rickety pier reaching out over a picturesque stream.  His \"Wall Street Journal\" is delivered by boat, and, having ascertained that his investments are doing well, he loads a wheelbarrow with assorted cans of paint, long sticks, and a spray gun, has two helpers carry his enormous blank canvas, and sets off to his muddy \"studio\" by the side of the stream.  All day long he flings, scatters, shoots, pushes paint all over his canvas and himself.  The picture grows, and, actually, turns out to be quite handsome-in the Jackson Pollock manner, of course, but attractive for all it imitativeness.  Sea gulls and swans waddle by, their expressions rather suggesting that of critics.\n\nAt last the painter is finished, carefully studies his work-and then proceeds to cut the enormous canvas up into pieces.\n\nAt the end of the day a small seaplane comes by, docks alongside the pier, while the passenger-pilot, looking like any 57th St. dealer you care to name, surveys the day's work.  He examines carefully, he ponders, and he finally selects one small segment of the canvas, places it in the plane, and takes off.\n\nThe painter takes all the other pieces, tosses them into the stream, and they float away with the gulls and swans, not unlike the unforgettable Gulley Jimson, in \"The Horse's Mouth,\" floating gallantly out to sea in his battered tugboat.\n\nAudiences, apparently, are enjoying the film-except for a group the other night who were plainly pro-abstract-expressionism, and hissed when the rest of the house applauded.  None of it was ill-natured, however, probably because the abstract-expressionism picture being kidded looks so agreeable.\n\nAwards\nDay of the Painter won an Oscar at the 33rd Academy Awards in 1961 for Best Short Subject.\nPassage 4:\nJacques D\u00e9combe\nJacques D\u00e9combe is a French author, actor and director born in 1953.\n\nBiography\nAfter he studied at the Conservatoire national d'art dramatique, he was the director of the shows of Les Inconnus at the request of Didier Bourdon and won the Moli\u00e8re Award for best comedy show. (See fr:Moli\u00e8re du meilleur spectacle comique) in 1991. He also directed shows by Charlotte de Turckheim, Chevallier et Laspal\u00e8s, Patrick Timsit, Les Chevaliers du fiel...\nPassage 5:\nRobert P. Davis\nRobert P. Davis (October 8, 1929 \u2013 November 7, 2005) was an American author, screenwriter, and film director whose works are primarily centered on aviation.\nHis 1960 short film, Day of the Painter, won an Academy Award in 1961 for Best Short Subject.Davis's 1976 novel The Pilot, about an alcohol-abusing airline captain, served as the source material for his screenplay for the motion picture of the same title, released in 1980, in which Cliff Robertson acted out the lead role and which Robertson also directed.\n\nMovies and TV\nDay of the Painter (short film) (1960)\nThe Pilot (1980)\nFinal Descent (TV) (1997), based on The Glass Cockpit\n\nBooks\nThe Pilot (New York: Morrow, 1976)\nCat Five (New York: Pocket Books, 1977)\nControl Tower (New York: Putnam's, 1980)\nThe Glass Cockpit (1991)\nPassage 6:\nYolonda Ross\nYolonda Ross is an American actress, writer and director.\n\nLife and career\nRoss was born and raised in Omaha, Nebraska.

This, as the screen truly proclaims, is the end.\nNew York Herald Tribune:\n\nA hilarious good - natured spoof of abstract-expressionist painting has been made the subject of a colored film-short called \"Day of the Painter.\" .........Without sound or sub-titles (except for a delightful musical score somewhat reminiscent of that which accompanied the Alex Guinness film, \"The Horse's Mouth\") the film begins with the artist's awakening in a crumbling shack on a rickety pier reaching out over a picturesque stream.  His \"Wall Street Journal\" is delivered by boat, and, having ascertained that his investments are doing well, he loads a wheelbarrow with assorted cans of paint, long sticks, and a spray gun, has two helpers carry his enormous blank canvas, and sets off to his muddy \"studio\" by the side of the stream.  All day long he flings, scatters, shoots, pushes paint all over his canvas and himself.  The picture grows, and, actually, turns out to be quite handsome-in the Jackson Pollock manner, of course, but attractive for all it imitativeness.  Sea gulls and swans waddle by, their expressions rather suggesting that of critics.\n\nAt last the painter is finished, carefully studies his work-and then proceeds to cut the enormous canvas up into pieces.\n\nAt the end of the day a small seaplane comes by, docks alongside the pier, while the passenger-pilot, looking like any 57th St. dealer you care to name, surveys the day's work.  He examines carefully, he ponders, and he finally selects one small segment of the canvas, places it in the plane, and takes off.\n\nThe painter takes all the other pieces, tosses them into the stream, and they float away with the gulls and swans, not unlike the unforgettable Gulley Jimson, in \"The Horse's Mouth,\" floating gallantly out to sea in his battered tugboat.\n\nAudiences, apparently, are enjoying the film-except for a group the other night who were plainly pro-abstract-expressionism, and hissed when the rest of the house applauded.  None of it was ill-natured, however, probably because the abstract-expressionism picture being kidded looks so agreeable.\n\nAwards\nDay of the Painter won an Oscar at the 33rd Academy Awards in 1961 for Best Short Subject.\nPassage 4:\nJacques D\u00e9combe\nJacques D\u00e9combe is a French author, actor and director born in 1953.\n\nBiography\nAfter he studied at the Conservatoire national d'art dramatique, he was the director of the shows of Les Inconnus at the request of Didier Bourdon and won the Moli\u00e8re Award for best comedy show.

In the first innings of his first match, against Lancashire at The Oval, he took five wickets for 81 runs.In his first full season, 1948, he was Surrey's leading wicket-taker and in the last home game of the season he was awarded his county cap \u2013 he celebrated by taking eight Northamptonshire wickets for 46 runs at The Oval, six of them coming in the space of 6.3 overs for seven runs. This would remain the best bowling performance of his first-class career, not surpassed, but he did equal it seven years later. In the following game, the last away match of the season, he took 10 Hampshire wickets for 150 runs in the match at Bournemouth. In the 1948 season as a whole, he took 91 wickets at an average of 28.07. As a tail-end left-handed batsman, he managed just 93 runs in the season at an average of 4.22.The emergence of Tony Lock as a slow left-arm bowler in 1949 brought a stuttering end of McMahon's Surrey career. Though he played in 12 first-class matches in the 1949 season, McMahon took only 19 wickets; a similar number of matches in 1950 brought 34 wickets. In 1951, he played just seven times and in 1952 only three times. In 1953, Lock split the first finger of his left hand, and played in only 11 of Surrey's County Championship matches; McMahon played as his deputy in 14 Championship matches, though a measure of their comparative merits was that Lock's 11 games produced 67 wickets at 12.38 runs apiece, while McMahon's 14 games brought him 45 wickets at the, for him, low average of 21.53. At the end of the 1953 season, McMahon was allowed to leave Surrey to join Somerset, then languishing at the foot of the County Championship and recruiting widely from other counties and other countries.\n\nSomerset cricketer\nSomerset's slow bowling in 1954 was in the hands of leg-spinner Johnny Lawrence, with support from the off-spin of Jim Hilton while promising off-spinner Brian Langford was on national service. McMahon filled a vacancy for a left-arm orthodox spinner that had been there since the retirement of Horace Hazell at the end of the 1952 season; Hazell's apparent successor, Roy Smith, had failed to realise his promise as a bowler in 1953, though his batting had advanced significantly.\nMcMahon instantly became a first-team regular and played in almost every match during his four years with the county, not missing a single Championship game until he was controversially dropped from the side in August 1957, after which he did not play in the Championship again.In the 1954 season, McMahon, alongside fellow newcomer Hilton, was something of a disappointment, according to Wisden: \"The new spin bowlers, McMahon and Hilton, did not attain to the best standards of their craft in a wet summer, yet, like the rest of the attack, they would have fared better with reasonable support in the field and from their own batsmen,\" it said. McMahon took 85 wickets at an average of 27.47 (Hilton took only 42 at a higher average). His best match was against Essex at Weston-super-Mare where he took six for 96 in the first innings and five for 45 in the second to finish with match figures of 11 for 141, which were the best of his career. He was awarded his county cap in the 1954 season, but Somerset remained at the bottom of the table.\nThe figures for the 1955 were similar: McMahon this time took 75 wickets at 28.77 apiece. There was a small improvement in his batting and the arrival of Bryan Lobb elevated McMahon to No 10 in the batting order for most of the season, and he responded with 262 runs and an average of 9.03. This included his highest-ever score, 24, made in the match against Sussex at Frome. A week later in Somerset's next match, he equalled his best-ever bowling performance, taking eight Kent wickets for 46 runs in the first innings of a match at Yeovil through what Wisden called \"clever variation of flight and spin\". These matches brought two victories for Somerset, but there were only two others in the 1955 season and the side finished at the bottom of the Championship for the fourth season running.At the end of the 1955 season, Lawrence retired and McMahon became Somerset's senior spin bowler for the 1956 season, with Langford returning from National Service as the main support. McMahon responded with his most successful season so far, taking 103 wickets at an average of 25.57, the only season in his career in which he exceeded 100 wickets. The bowling average improved still further in 1957 to 23.10 when McMahon took 86 wickets. But his season came to an abrupt end in mid-August 1957 when, after 108 consecutive Championship matches, he was dropped from the first team during the Weston-super-Mare festival. Though he played some games for the second eleven later in August, he regained his place in the first team for only a single end-of-season friendly match, and he was told that his services were not required for the future, a decision, said Wisden, that \"proved highly controversial\".\n\nSacked by Somerset\nThe reason behind McMahon's sacking did not become public knowledge for many years. In its obituary of him in 2002, McMahon was described by Wisden as \"a man who embraced the antipodean virtues of candour and conviviality\". It went on: \"Legend tells of a night at the Flying Horse Inn in Nottingham when he beheaded the gladioli with an ornamental sword, crying: 'When Mac drinks, everybody drinks!'\" The obituary recounts a further escapade in second eleven match at Midsomer Norton where a curfew imposed on the team was circumvented by \"a POW-type loop\" organised by McMahon, \"with his team-mates escaping through a ground-storey window and then presenting themselves again\". As the only Somerset second eleven match that McMahon played in at Midsomer Norton was right at the end of the 1957 season, this may have been the final straw. But in any case there had been \"an embarrassing episode at Swansea's Grand Hotel\" earlier in the season, also involving Jim Hilton, who was also dismissed at the end of the season. Team-mates and club members petitioned for McMahon to be reinstated, but the county club was not to be moved.\nAfter a period in Lancashire League cricket with Milnrow Cricket Club, McMahon moved back to London where he did office work, later contributing some articles to cricket magazines.\n\n\n== Notes and references ==\nPassage 3:\nIsabella Harwood\nIsabella Harwood or Ross Neil (14 June 1837 \u2013 29 May 1888) was a British novelist who also wrote dramas in verse.\n\nBiography\nHarwood was probably born in Dorset in 1837 where her parents Phillip Harwood and his wife Isabella Neil lived.

He was the son of the Reverend Edward Moore and Lady Harriet Janet Sarah Montagu-Scott, who was one of the daughters of the 4th Duke of Buccleuch. One of his brothers, Arthur, became an admiral and was knighted. Their great \ngrandfather was John Moore, Archbishop of Canterbury from 1783 to 1805. One of their sisters was a maid of honour to Queen Victoria.Moore went to New Zealand in the 1870s and lived in Geraldine and Christchurch. He married Henrietta Lysaght of H\u0101wera in November 1879, and they had one son. In May 1884 she died a few days after giving birth to a daughter, who also died.In 1886 Moore became a Justice of the Peace in Geraldine. In 1897 he married Alice Fish of Geraldine. They moved to England four years before his death in 1916.\n\nCricket career\nMoore was a right-handed middle-order batsman. In consecutive seasons, 1876\u201377 and 1877\u201378, playing for Canterbury, he made the highest score in the short New Zealand first-class season: 76 and 75 respectively. His 76 came in his first match for Canterbury, against Otago. He went to the wicket early on the first day with the score at 7 for 2 and put on 99 for the third wicket with Charles Corfe before he was out with the score at 106 for 3 after a \"very fine exhibition of free hitting, combined with good defence\". Canterbury were all out for 133, but went on to win the match. His 75 came in the next season's match against Otago, when he took the score from 22 for 2 to 136 for 6. The New Zealand cricket historian Tom Reese said, \"Right from the beginning he smote the bowling hip and thigh, going out of his ground to indulge in some forceful driving.\" Canterbury won again.Moore led the batting averages in the Canterbury Cricket Association in 1877\u201378 with 379 runs at an average of 34.4. Also in 1877\u201378, he was a member of the Canterbury team that inflicted the only defeat on the touring Australians. In 1896\u201397, at the age of 47, he top-scored in each innings for a South Canterbury XVIII against the touring Queensland cricket team.\nPassage 5:\nRoss McMillan\nPeter Ross McMillan (born 2 June 1987) is a professional rugby union player.

He went to England at the end of World War II as a member of the Royal Air Force, and settled in Kidderminster in Worcestershire in 1947, where he worked as a civilian lorry driver for the RAF. He began playing for Kidderminster Cricket Club in the Birmingham League, and at the start of the 1952 season, opening the bowling for the club's senior team, he had figures of 7 for 9 and 7 for 37.Worcestershire invited him to play for them, and he made his first-class debut against Sussex in July 1952. He took five wickets in the match (his maiden victim being Ken Suttle) and then held on for 4 not out with Peter Richardson (20 not out) to add the 12 runs needed for a one-wicket victory after his county had collapsed from 192 for 2 to 238 for 9. A week later he claimed four wickets against Warwickshire, then a few days later still he managed 6 for 52 (five of his victims bowled) in what was otherwise a disastrous innings defeat to Derbyshire. In the last match of the season he took a career-best 6 for 51 against Glamorgan; he and Reg Perks (4 for 59) bowled unchanged throughout the first innings. Worcestershire won the game and Lobban finished the season with 23 wickets at 23.69.He took 23 wickets again in 1953, but at a considerably worse average of 34.43, and had only two really successful games: against Oxford University in June, when he took 5 for 70, and then against Sussex in July. On this occasion Lobban claimed eight wickets, his most in a match, including 6 for 103 in the first innings. He also made his highest score with the bat, 18, but Sussex won by five wickets.In 1954 Lobban made only two first-class appearances, and managed only the single wicket of Gloucestershire tail-ender Bomber Wells. In his final game, against Warwickshire at Dudley, his nine first-innings overs cost 51. He bowled just two overs in the second innings as Warwickshire completed an easy ten-wicket win. Lobban played one more Second XI game, against Glamorgan II at Cardiff Arms Park; in this he picked up five wickets.\nHe was also a professional boxer and played rugby union for Kidderminster.He later moved to Canada, where he worked as a teacher in Burnaby, British Columbia.

In the first innings of his first match, against Lancashire at The Oval, he took five wickets for 81 runs.In his first full season, 1948, he was Surrey's leading wicket-taker and in the last home game of the season he was awarded his county cap \u2013 he celebrated by taking eight Northamptonshire wickets for 46 runs at The Oval, six of them coming in the space of 6.3 overs for seven runs. This would remain the best bowling performance of his first-class career, not surpassed, but he did equal it seven years later. In the following game, the last away match of the season, he took 10 Hampshire wickets for 150 runs in the match at Bournemouth. In the 1948 season as a whole, he took 91 wickets at an average of 28.07. As a tail-end left-handed batsman, he managed just 93 runs in the season at an average of 4.22.The emergence of Tony Lock as a slow left-arm bowler in 1949 brought a stuttering end of McMahon's Surrey career. Though he played in 12 first-class matches in the 1949 season, McMahon took only 19 wickets; a similar number of matches in 1950 brought 34 wickets. In 1951, he played just seven times and in 1952 only three times. In 1953, Lock split the first finger of his left hand, and played in only 11 of Surrey's County Championship matches; McMahon played as his deputy in 14 Championship matches, though a measure of their comparative merits was that Lock's 11 games produced 67 wickets at 12.38 runs apiece, while McMahon's 14 games brought him 45 wickets at the, for him, low average of 21.53. At the end of the 1953 season, McMahon was allowed to leave Surrey to join Somerset, then languishing at the foot of the County Championship and recruiting widely from other counties and other countries.\n\nSomerset cricketer\nSomerset's slow bowling in 1954 was in the hands of leg-spinner Johnny Lawrence, with support from the off-spin of Jim Hilton while promising off-spinner Brian Langford was on national service. McMahon filled a vacancy for a left-arm orthodox spinner that had been there since the retirement of Horace Hazell at the end of the 1952 season; Hazell's apparent successor, Roy Smith, had failed to realise his promise as a bowler in 1953, though his batting had advanced significantly.\nMcMahon instantly became a first-team regular and played in almost every match during his four years with the county, not missing a single Championship game until he was controversially dropped from the side in August 1957, after which he did not play in the Championship again.In the 1954 season, McMahon, alongside fellow newcomer Hilton, was something of a disappointment, according to Wisden: \"The new spin bowlers, McMahon and Hilton, did not attain to the best standards of their craft in a wet summer, yet, like the rest of the attack, they would have fared better with reasonable support in the field and from their own batsmen,\" it said. McMahon took 85 wickets at an average of 27.47 (Hilton took only 42 at a higher average). His best match was against Essex at Weston-super-Mare where he took six for 96 in the first innings and five for 45 in the second to finish with match figures of 11 for 141, which were the best of his career. He was awarded his county cap in the 1954 season, but Somerset remained at the bottom of the table.\nThe figures for the 1955 were similar: McMahon this time took 75 wickets at 28.77 apiece. There was a small improvement in his batting and the arrival of Bryan Lobb elevated McMahon to No 10 in the batting order for most of the season, and he responded with 262 runs and an average of 9.03. This included his highest-ever score, 24, made in the match against Sussex at Frome. A week later in Somerset's next match, he equalled his best-ever bowling performance, taking eight Kent wickets for 46 runs in the first innings of a match at Yeovil through what Wisden called \"clever variation of flight and spin\". These matches brought two victories for Somerset, but there were only two others in the 1955 season and the side finished at the bottom of the Championship for the fourth season running.At the end of the 1955 season, Lawrence retired and McMahon became Somerset's senior spin bowler for the 1956 season, with Langford returning from National Service as the main support. McMahon responded with his most successful season so far, taking 103 wickets at an average of 25.57, the only season in his career in which he exceeded 100 wickets. The bowling average improved still further in 1957 to 23.10 when McMahon took 86 wickets. But his season came to an abrupt end in mid-August 1957 when, after 108 consecutive Championship matches, he was dropped from the first team during the Weston-super-Mare festival. Though he played some games for the second eleven later in August, he regained his place in the first team for only a single end-of-season friendly match, and he was told that his services were not required for the future, a decision, said Wisden, that \"proved highly controversial\".\n\nSacked by Somerset\nThe reason behind McMahon's sacking did not become public knowledge for many years. In its obituary of him in 2002, McMahon was described by Wisden as \"a man who embraced the antipodean virtues of candour and conviviality\". It went on: \"Legend tells of a night at the Flying Horse Inn in Nottingham when he beheaded the gladioli with an ornamental sword, crying: 'When Mac drinks, everybody drinks!'\" The obituary recounts a further escapade in second eleven match at Midsomer Norton where a curfew imposed on the team was circumvented by \"a POW-type loop\" organised by McMahon, \"with his team-mates escaping through a ground-storey window and then presenting themselves again\". As the only Somerset second eleven match that McMahon played in at Midsomer Norton was right at the end of the 1957 season, this may have been the final straw. But in any case there had been \"an embarrassing episode at Swansea's Grand Hotel\" earlier in the season, also involving Jim Hilton, who was also dismissed at the end of the season. Team-mates and club members petitioned for McMahon to be reinstated, but the county club was not to be moved.\nAfter a period in Lancashire League cricket with Milnrow Cricket Club, McMahon moved back to London where he did office work, later contributing some articles to cricket magazines.\n\n\n== Notes and references ==\nPassage 3:\nIsabella Harwood\nIsabella Harwood or Ross Neil (14 June 1837 \u2013 29 May 1888) was a British novelist who also wrote dramas in verse.\n\nBiography\nHarwood was probably born in Dorset in 1837 where her parents Phillip Harwood and his wife Isabella Neil lived.

He was the son of the Reverend Edward Moore and Lady Harriet Janet Sarah Montagu-Scott, who was one of the daughters of the 4th Duke of Buccleuch. One of his brothers, Arthur, became an admiral and was knighted. Their great \ngrandfather was John Moore, Archbishop of Canterbury from 1783 to 1805. One of their sisters was a maid of honour to Queen Victoria.Moore went to New Zealand in the 1870s and lived in Geraldine and Christchurch. He married Henrietta Lysaght of H\u0101wera in November 1879, and they had one son. In May 1884 she died a few days after giving birth to a daughter, who also died.In 1886 Moore became a Justice of the Peace in Geraldine. In 1897 he married Alice Fish of Geraldine. They moved to England four years before his death in 1916.\n\nCricket career\nMoore was a right-handed middle-order batsman. In consecutive seasons, 1876\u201377 and 1877\u201378, playing for Canterbury, he made the highest score in the short New Zealand first-class season: 76 and 75 respectively. His 76 came in his first match for Canterbury, against Otago. He went to the wicket early on the first day with the score at 7 for 2 and put on 99 for the third wicket with Charles Corfe before he was out with the score at 106 for 3 after a \"very fine exhibition of free hitting, combined with good defence\". Canterbury were all out for 133, but went on to win the match. His 75 came in the next season's match against Otago, when he took the score from 22 for 2 to 136 for 6. The New Zealand cricket historian Tom Reese said, \"Right from the beginning he smote the bowling hip and thigh, going out of his ground to indulge in some forceful driving.\" Canterbury won again.Moore led the batting averages in the Canterbury Cricket Association in 1877\u201378 with 379 runs at an average of 34.4. Also in 1877\u201378, he was a member of the Canterbury team that inflicted the only defeat on the touring Australians. In 1896\u201397, at the age of 47, he top-scored in each innings for a South Canterbury XVIII against the touring Queensland cricket team.\nPassage 5:\nRoss McMillan\nPeter Ross McMillan (born 2 June 1987) is a professional rugby union player.

He went to England at the end of World War II as a member of the Royal Air Force, and settled in Kidderminster in Worcestershire in 1947, where he worked as a civilian lorry driver for the RAF. He began playing for Kidderminster Cricket Club in the Birmingham League, and at the start of the 1952 season, opening the bowling for the club's senior team, he had figures of 7 for 9 and 7 for 37.Worcestershire invited him to play for them, and he made his first-class debut against Sussex in July 1952. He took five wickets in the match (his maiden victim being Ken Suttle) and then held on for 4 not out with Peter Richardson (20 not out) to add the 12 runs needed for a one-wicket victory after his county had collapsed from 192 for 2 to 238 for 9. A week later he claimed four wickets against Warwickshire, then a few days later still he managed 6 for 52 (five of his victims bowled) in what was otherwise a disastrous innings defeat to Derbyshire. In the last match of the season he took a career-best 6 for 51 against Glamorgan; he and Reg Perks (4 for 59) bowled unchanged throughout the first innings. Worcestershire won the game and Lobban finished the season with 23 wickets at 23.69.He took 23 wickets again in 1953, but at a considerably worse average of 34.43, and had only two really successful games: against Oxford University in June, when he took 5 for 70, and then against Sussex in July. On this occasion Lobban claimed eight wickets, his most in a match, including 6 for 103 in the first innings. He also made his highest score with the bat, 18, but Sussex won by five wickets.In 1954 Lobban made only two first-class appearances, and managed only the single wicket of Gloucestershire tail-ender Bomber Wells. In his final game, against Warwickshire at Dudley, his nine first-innings overs cost 51. He bowled just two overs in the second innings as Warwickshire completed an easy ten-wicket win. Lobban played one more Second XI game, against Glamorgan II at Cardiff Arms Park; in this he picked up five wickets.\nHe was also a professional boxer and played rugby union for Kidderminster.He later moved to Canada, where he worked as a teacher in Burnaby, British Columbia. He and his wife Celia had a son and two daughters.\nPassage 10:\nWale Adebanwi\nWale Adebanwi (born 1969) is a Nigerian-born first Black Rhodes Professor at St Antony's College, Oxford where he was, until June 2021, a Professor of Race Relations, and the Director of the African Studies Centre, School of Interdisciplinary Area Studies, and a Governing Board Fellow.

In 1608, he founded the Rutheneum Gymnasium in Gera (now the Goethe-Gymnasium/Rutheneum).  Against the advice of his theological councillor, he granted asylum to Calvinist refugees from Flanders and housed them in his capital city Gera.  This led to an upsurge in wool production and an economic boom.  During his reign, Gera also developed into the cultural centre of the Reuss areas.  He had a particular fondness for \"ring riding\", and was a frequent guest at the courts in Vienna and Dresden.\nHenry II died on 23 December 1635 and was buried in the Salvator Church in Gera.  The composer Heinrich Sch\u00fctz wrote his Musikalische Exequien for this occasion.  His elaborately decorated copper outer coffin, with biblical proverbs and evangelical chorals, was transferred from the Salvator Church to the St. John church in 1995.

He is first mentioned in 1328, when he fights in the Battle of Cassel and accompanies Count William III of Holland to Flanders, to assist the Count of Flanders suppressing a rebellion in Bruges and the surrounding area.\nIn 1343, he is a member of a group of bailiffs who administer Holland while the Count is travelling.  In 1344, he is enfeoffed with Nieuwendoorn castle.  He participated in the third crusade of Count William IV to Prussia and in the Siege of Utrecht in 1345, but not in the disastrous Battle of Warns later that year.\nIn subsequent years, he played an important role in the politics of Holland.  In 1350, he was one of the signatories of the Cod Alliance Treaty that set off the Hook and Cod wars.  He fought in the Battle of Naarden in 1350 and in the Battle of Zwartewaal in 1351.  He was then sent to England to mediate in the dispute between Countess Margaret and her son, Count William V, however, he was unsuccessful.\nAfter he returned to Holland, he began a campaign against the citizens of Bunschoten in 1355.  In the winter of 1356, he besieged the castle of Nyevelt, on the orders of the count, and took it after a seven-week siege.  In 1356, William V appointed him governor of the area above the Meuse, jointly with his brother Gerry.  In 1358, William V was declared insane by his brother Albert.  John I was a member of the regency council.  In 1359, he is one of the Cod leaders to sign a reconciliation with the city of Delft.\nIn 1363, his father-in-law, Lord Arnold of IJsselstein died and John I inherited the Lordship of IJsselstein.\nHe died in 1369 and was buried in the church of IJsselstein.\n\nMarriage and issue\nHe married Guida of IJsselstein and had the following children:\n\nArnold (c.\u20091337\u2013 1409), his successor\nGerry\nAlbert, a canon in Utrecht\nBeatrix, married Ghisbert of Vianen\nBearte\nMaria (d. c.\u20091384), married Philip IV of Wassenaer\nCatherine, married Bartholomew of Raephorst\nAntonia, abbess in 's-Hertogenbosch\nElisabeth\nGreta\nPassage 8:\nEric I, Duke of Schleswig\nEric I Abels\u00f8n (Danish: Erik 1. Abels\u00f8n af Danmark) (died 27 May 1272) was a Danish nobleman. He was the ruling Duke of Schleswig from 1260 until his death in 1272. He was the second son of King Abel of Denmark, Duke of Schleswig and Mechtild of Holstein.\n\nEarly life\nAfter the death of his elder brother Duke Valdemar III in 1257, Eric inherited the claim to the Duchy of Schleswig. However, his uncle and potential feudal overlord King Christopher I of Denmark refused to install him as duke.\nSubsequently, Eric participated in the coalition of Bishop Peder Bang of Roskilde and Prince Jaromar II of Rugia against King Christopher. He took part in the military campaign of 1259 which resulted in the conquest of Copenhagen.\n\nDuke of Schleswig\nAfter the death of Christopher in 1259, he was created Duke of Schleswig by the new king Eric V in 1260.\nAlready the following year, fighting with the king broke out anew. The Queen Dowager, Margaret Sambiria, acting as regent for her under age son, feared aggression from the Duke. However, Duke Eric was able to defeat the royal army at the Battle of Lohede and capture the young King Eric and his mother. As a result, he was able to obtain huge advantages for his duchy at the subsequent treaty in 1264.\nIn 1268, he acquired Gottorp Castle from Bishop Bonde of Schleswig, who then moved his residence to Schwabstedt.\nDuke Eric died 27 May 1272.\n\nMarriage and issue\nEric married Margaret of Rugia, a daughter of Jaromar II, Prince of Rugia in 1259 or 1260. They had the following children:\n\nMargaret (died after 1313), married Helmold III, Count of Schwerin\nValdemar IV, Duke of Schleswig (app. 1265\u20131312)\nEric (Longbone), from 1295 Lord of Langeland (1272\u20131310), married Sophia Burghardsdatter (died 1325), daughter of Queen dowager Jutta of Denmark and Count Burchard VIII of Querfurt-Rosenburg, Burgrave of Magdeburg\n\n\n== Ancestry ==\nPassage 9:\nJohn II, Lord of Polanen\nJohn III, Lord of Polanen (c.\u20091325 \u2013 3 November 1378 in Breda) was Lord of Polanen, Lord of De Lek and Lord of Breda.\n\nLife\nHe was a son of John I, Lord of Polanen and Catherine of Brederode. Polanen Castle near Monster was the ancestral seat of the family. In 1327 John I had acquired Oud Haerlem Castle. In 1339, John II purchased the Lordship of Breda and built Breda Castle, together with his father.\nJohn succeeded his father in 1342 and also took over his father's position as councilor of the Count of Holland and Zeeland. In the autumn of 1343, he accompanied Count William IV on a pilgrimage to the Holy Land. He also participated in a crusade against the Prussians. He was not present in the September 1345 campaign against the Frisians, which saw William IV killed during the disastrous Battle of Warns. On 17 November 1345, John II granted Polanen Castle in arrear fief to his younger brother Philip I of Polanen.\n\nFirst phase of the Hook and Cod Wars\nWilliam of Duivenvoorde and his nephew John II were leaders of what would become known as the 'Hook' party during the Hook and Cod wars. In 1350, they travelled to Hainaut to pay homage to Countess Margaret II. Somewhere between 1347 and 1350, John was appointed Burgrave of Geertruidenberg. In 1350, he purchased the Land of Breda for 43000 florins from John III, Duke of Brabant. He also acquired high justice over Breda.\nThe Hook and Cod wars started in earnest in about March 1351. Polanen Castle was besieged for 2 weeks and then demolished. Oud Haerlem Castle was taken after a siege which lasted more than 6 months, even though John van not present. The Siege of Geertuidenberg Castle lasted from October 1351 to August 1352. Here John's brother Philip commanded as his lieutenant. As a result of the war John lost the Lordship of De Lek.\n\nDuring the regency of Albert of Bavaria\nIn 1358, Albert of Bavaria became regent of Holland for his brother. This was good for the members of the old Hook faction. In 1358 John was somewhat compensated for his losses with other fiefs and possessions.\n\nIn Brabant\nWhatever the later events in Holland, John seems to have concentrated his efforts on extending his holdings in the Breda area. It made him more of a Brabant than a Holland lord.\nJohn II was captured during the 1371 Battle of Baesweiler. He was released several months later, after his relatives had paid a ransom. In 1375, he was appointed stadtholder of the Great Holme.\nJohn II died in 1378 and was buried in the Church of Our Lady in Breda.\n\nMarriages and issue\nJohn II of Polanen married three times.\nIn 1340, he married Oda of Horne-Altena (1318-1353), daughter of Willem IV of Horne. They had three children:\n\nJohn III, his heir\nBeatrice (c.\u20091344 \u2013 1394); married Henry VIII, the son of Henry VII, Lord of Bautershem, who was also Lord of Bergen op Zoom as Henry I, and his wife, Maria Merxheim, Lady of Wuustwezel and Brecht\nOda (c.\u20091351 \u2013 15th century), married Henry III, Burgrave of MontfoortIn 1353, he married Matilda (c.\u20091324 \u2013 1366), an illegitimate daughter of John III, Duke of Brabant.  They had two sons:\n\nDirck of the Leck (d. 1416), married Gilisje of Cralingen.  He was outlawed for a while, because he was suspected of having participated in the murder of Aleid van Poelgeest\nHenry of the Leck (d. 1427), married Jeanne of Ghistelles, and was a councillor of Countess Jacqueline of HollandIn 1370, he married Margaret, a daughter of Otto, Lord of Lippe and Irmgard of the Marck.  They had one son:\n\nOtto (d. before 20 October 1428), married before 1396 to Sophia, a daughter of Count Frederick III of Bergh-'s-Heerenberg and Catherine of Buren\nPassage 10:\nAnne Holck\nAnne Holck (7 December 1602, Tryggev\u00e6lde - 5 June 1660, Stensgaard, Langeland) was a Danish noble.

In 1659, her spouse died from the wounds he received when he led the defense of Langeland against Swedish invasion, and after his death, she took over and defended the island against the attack until she was forced to surrender.

He was the director of the Peabody Essex Museum in Salem for 17 months, resigning December 31, 2020. He was the director of the Toledo Museum of Art in Ohio from 2010 to 2019. He was the director of the Hood Museum of Art from 2005 to 2010, and the National Gallery of Australia (Canberra) from 1997 to 2004.\n\nCareer\nBrian Kennedy currently lives and works in the United States after leaving Australia in 2005 to direct the Hood Museum of Art at Dartmouth College. In October 2010 he became the ninth Director of the Toledo Museum of Art. On 1 July 2019, he succeeded Dan Monroe as the executive director and CEO of the Peabody Essex Museum.\n\nEarly life and career in Ireland\nKennedy was born in Dublin and attended Clonkeen College. He received B.A. (1982), M.A. (1985) and PhD (1989) degrees from University College-Dublin, where he studied both art history and history.\nHe worked in the Irish Department of Education (1982), the European Commission, Brussels (1983), and in Ireland at the Chester Beatty Library (1983\u201385), Government Publications Office (1985\u201386), and Department of Finance (1986\u201389). He married Mary Fiona Carlin in 1988.He was Assistant Director at the National Gallery of Ireland in Dublin from 1989 to 1997. He was Chair of the Irish Association of Art Historians from 1996 to 1997, and of the Council of Australian Art Museum Directors from 2001 to 2003. In September 1997 he became Director of the National Gallery of Australia.\n\nNational Gallery of Australia (NGA)\nKennedy expanded the traveling exhibitions and loans program throughout Australia, arranged for several major shows of Australian art abroad, increased the number of exhibitions at the museum itself and oversaw the development of an extensive multi-media site.  Although he oversaw several years of the museum's highest ever annual visitation, he discontinued the emphasis of his predecessor, Betty Churcher, on showing \"blockbuster\" exhibitions.\nDuring his directorship, the NGA gained government support for improving the building and significant private donations and corporate sponsorship. However, the initial design for the building proved controversial generating a public dispute with the original architect on moral rights grounds.  As a result, the project was not delivered during Dr Kennedy's tenure, with a significantly altered design completed some years later.  Private funding supported two acquisitions of British art, including David Hockney's A Bigger Grand Canyon in 1999, and Lucian Freud's After C\u00e9zanne in 2001. Kennedy built on the established collections at the museum by acquiring the Holmgren-Spertus collection of Indonesian textiles; the Kenneth Tyler collection of editioned prints, screens, multiples and unique proofs; and the Australian Print Workshop Archive. He was also notable for campaigning for the construction of a new \"front\" entrance to the Gallery, facing King Edward Terrace, which was completed in 2010 (see reference to the building project above).\nKennedy's cancellation of the \"Sensation exhibition\" (scheduled at the NGA from 2 June 2000 to 13 August 2000) was controversial, and seen by some as censorship. He claimed that the decision was due to the exhibition being \"too close to the market\" implying that a national cultural institution cannot exhibit the private collection of a speculative art investor. However, there were other exhibitions at the NGA during his tenure, which could have raised similar concerns. The exhibition featured the privately owned Young British Artists works belonging to Charles Saatchi and attracted large attendances in London and Brooklyn. Its most controversial work was Chris Ofili's The Holy Virgin Mary, a painting which used elephant dung and was accused of being blasphemous. The then-mayor of New York, Rudolph Giuliani, campaigned against the exhibition, claiming it was \"Catholic-bashing\" and an \"aggressive, vicious, disgusting attack on religion.\" In November 1999, Kennedy cancelled the exhibition and stated that the events in New York had \"obscured discussion of the artistic merit of the works of art\". He has said that it \"was the toughest decision of my professional life, so far.\"Kennedy was also repeatedly questioned on his management of a range of issues during the Australian Government's Senate Estimates process - particularly on the NGA's occupational health and safety record and concerns about the NGA's twenty-year-old air-conditioning system. The air-conditioning was finally renovated in 2003. Kennedy announced in 2002 that he would not seek extension of his contract beyond 2004, accepting a seven-year term as had his two predecessors.He became a joint Irish-Australian citizen in 2003.\n\nToledo Museum of Art\nThe Toledo Museum of Art is known for its exceptional collections of European and American paintings and sculpture, glass, antiquities, artist books, Japanese prints and netsuke. The museum offers free admission and is recognized for its historical leadership in the field of art education.  During his tenure, Kennedy has focused the museum's art education efforts on visual literacy, which he defines as \"learning to read, understand and write visual language.\"   Initiatives have included baby and toddler tours, specialized training for all staff, docents, volunteers and the launch of a website, www.vislit.org. In November 2014, the museum hosted the International Visual Literacy Association (IVLA) conference, the first Museum to do so. Kennedy has been a frequent speaker on the topic, including 2010 and 2013 TEDx talks on visual and sensory literacy.\nKennedy has expressed an interest in expanding the museum's collection of contemporary art and art by indigenous peoples. Works by Frank Stella, Sean Scully, Jaume Plensa, Ravinder Reddy and Mary Sibande have been acquired.  In addition, the museum has made major acquisitions of Old Master paintings by Frans Hals and Luca Giordano.During his tenure the Toledo Museum of Art has announced the return of several objects from its collection due to claims the objects were stolen and/or illegally exported prior being sold to the museum.  In 2011 a Meissen sweetmeat stand was returned to Germany followed by an Etruscan Kalpis or water jug to Italy (2013), an Indian sculpture of Ganesha (2014) and an astrological compendium to Germany in 2015.\n\nHood Museum of Art\nKennedy became Director of the Hood Museum of Art in July 2005. During his tenure, he implemented a series of large and small-scale exhibitions and oversaw the production of more than 20 publications to bring greater public attention to the museum's remarkable collections of the arts of America, Europe, Africa, Papua New Guinea and the Polar regions. At 70,000 objects, the Hood has one of the largest collections on any American college of university campus. The exhibition, Black Womanhood: Images, Icons, and Ideologies of the African Body, toured several US venues. Kennedy increased campus curricular use of works of art, with thousands of objects pulled from storage for classes annually. Numerous acquisitions were made with the museum's generous endowments, and he curated several exhibitions: including Wenda Gu: Forest of Stone Steles: Retranslation and Rewriting Tang Dynasty Poetry, Sean Scully: The Art of the Stripe, and Frank Stella: Irregular Polygons.\n\nPublications\nKennedy has written or edited a number of books on art, including:\n\nAlfred Chester Beatty and Ireland 1950-1968: A study in cultural politics, Glendale Press (1988), ISBN 978-0-907606-49-9\nDreams and responsibilities: The state and arts in independent Ireland, Arts Council of Ireland (1990), ISBN 978-0-906627-32-7\nJack B Yeats: Jack Butler Yeats, 1871-1957 (Lives of Irish Artists), Unipub (October 1991), ISBN 978-0-948524-24-0\nThe Anatomy Lesson: Art and Medicine (with Davis Coakley), National Gallery of Ireland (January 1992), ISBN 978-0-903162-65-4\nIreland: Art into History (with Raymond Gillespie), Roberts Rinehart Publishers (1994), ISBN 978-1-57098-005-3\nIrish Painting, Roberts Rinehart Publishers (November 1997),  ISBN 978-1-86059-059-7\nSean Scully: The Art of the Stripe, Hood Museum of Art (October 2008), ISBN 978-0-944722-34-3\nFrank Stella: Irregular Polygons, 1965-1966, Hood Museum of Art (October 2010), ISBN 978-0-944722-39-8\n\nHonors and achievements\nKennedy was awarded the Australian Centenary Medal in 2001 for service to Australian Society and its art. He is a trustee and treasurer of the Association of Art Museum Directors, a peer reviewer for the American Association of Museums and a member of the International Association of Art Critics. In 2013 he was appointed inaugural eminent professor at the University of Toledo and received an honorary doctorate from Lourdes University. Most recently, Kennedy received the 2014 Northwest Region, Ohio Art Education Association award for distinguished educator for art education.\n\n\n== Notes ==\nPassage 3:\nWilliam Dear\nWilliam Dear (born November 30, 1943) is a Canadian actor, director, producer and screenwriter.

He was the director of the Peabody Essex Museum in Salem for 17 months, resigning December 31, 2020. He was the director of the Toledo Museum of Art in Ohio from 2010 to 2019. He was the director of the Hood Museum of Art from 2005 to 2010, and the National Gallery of Australia (Canberra) from 1997 to 2004.\n\nCareer\nBrian Kennedy currently lives and works in the United States after leaving Australia in 2005 to direct the Hood Museum of Art at Dartmouth College. In October 2010 he became the ninth Director of the Toledo Museum of Art. On 1 July 2019, he succeeded Dan Monroe as the executive director and CEO of the Peabody Essex Museum.\n\nEarly life and career in Ireland\nKennedy was born in Dublin and attended Clonkeen College. He received B.A. (1982), M.A. (1985) and PhD (1989) degrees from University College-Dublin, where he studied both art history and history.\nHe worked in the Irish Department of Education (1982), the European Commission, Brussels (1983), and in Ireland at the Chester Beatty Library (1983\u201385), Government Publications Office (1985\u201386), and Department of Finance (1986\u201389). He married Mary Fiona Carlin in 1988.He was Assistant Director at the National Gallery of Ireland in Dublin from 1989 to 1997. He was Chair of the Irish Association of Art Historians from 1996 to 1997, and of the Council of Australian Art Museum Directors from 2001 to 2003. In September 1997 he became Director of the National Gallery of Australia.\n\nNational Gallery of Australia (NGA)\nKennedy expanded the traveling exhibitions and loans program throughout Australia, arranged for several major shows of Australian art abroad, increased the number of exhibitions at the museum itself and oversaw the development of an extensive multi-media site.  Although he oversaw several years of the museum's highest ever annual visitation, he discontinued the emphasis of his predecessor, Betty Churcher, on showing \"blockbuster\" exhibitions.\nDuring his directorship, the NGA gained government support for improving the building and significant private donations and corporate sponsorship. However, the initial design for the building proved controversial generating a public dispute with the original architect on moral rights grounds.  As a result, the project was not delivered during Dr Kennedy's tenure, with a significantly altered design completed some years later.  Private funding supported two acquisitions of British art, including David Hockney's A Bigger Grand Canyon in 1999, and Lucian Freud's After C\u00e9zanne in 2001. Kennedy built on the established collections at the museum by acquiring the Holmgren-Spertus collection of Indonesian textiles; the Kenneth Tyler collection of editioned prints, screens, multiples and unique proofs; and the Australian Print Workshop Archive. He was also notable for campaigning for the construction of a new \"front\" entrance to the Gallery, facing King Edward Terrace, which was completed in 2010 (see reference to the building project above).\nKennedy's cancellation of the \"Sensation exhibition\" (scheduled at the NGA from 2 June 2000 to 13 August 2000) was controversial, and seen by some as censorship. He claimed that the decision was due to the exhibition being \"too close to the market\" implying that a national cultural institution cannot exhibit the private collection of a speculative art investor. However, there were other exhibitions at the NGA during his tenure, which could have raised similar concerns. The exhibition featured the privately owned Young British Artists works belonging to Charles Saatchi and attracted large attendances in London and Brooklyn. Its most controversial work was Chris Ofili's The Holy Virgin Mary, a painting which used elephant dung and was accused of being blasphemous. The then-mayor of New York, Rudolph Giuliani, campaigned against the exhibition, claiming it was \"Catholic-bashing\" and an \"aggressive, vicious, disgusting attack on religion.\" In November 1999, Kennedy cancelled the exhibition and stated that the events in New York had \"obscured discussion of the artistic merit of the works of art\". He has said that it \"was the toughest decision of my professional life, so far.\"Kennedy was also repeatedly questioned on his management of a range of issues during the Australian Government's Senate Estimates process - particularly on the NGA's occupational health and safety record and concerns about the NGA's twenty-year-old air-conditioning system. The air-conditioning was finally renovated in 2003. Kennedy announced in 2002 that he would not seek extension of his contract beyond 2004, accepting a seven-year term as had his two predecessors.He became a joint Irish-Australian citizen in 2003.\n\nToledo Museum of Art\nThe Toledo Museum of Art is known for its exceptional collections of European and American paintings and sculpture, glass, antiquities, artist books, Japanese prints and netsuke. The museum offers free admission and is recognized for its historical leadership in the field of art education.  During his tenure, Kennedy has focused the museum's art education efforts on visual literacy, which he defines as \"learning to read, understand and write visual language.\"   Initiatives have included baby and toddler tours, specialized training for all staff, docents, volunteers and the launch of a website, www.vislit.org. In November 2014, the museum hosted the International Visual Literacy Association (IVLA) conference, the first Museum to do so. Kennedy has been a frequent speaker on the topic, including 2010 and 2013 TEDx talks on visual and sensory literacy.\nKennedy has expressed an interest in expanding the museum's collection of contemporary art and art by indigenous peoples. Works by Frank Stella, Sean Scully, Jaume Plensa, Ravinder Reddy and Mary Sibande have been acquired.  In addition, the museum has made major acquisitions of Old Master paintings by Frans Hals and Luca Giordano.During his tenure the Toledo Museum of Art has announced the return of several objects from its collection due to claims the objects were stolen and/or illegally exported prior being sold to the museum.  In 2011 a Meissen sweetmeat stand was returned to Germany followed by an Etruscan Kalpis or water jug to Italy (2013), an Indian sculpture of Ganesha (2014) and an astrological compendium to Germany in 2015.\n\nHood Museum of Art\nKennedy became Director of the Hood Museum of Art in July 2005. During his tenure, he implemented a series of large and small-scale exhibitions and oversaw the production of more than 20 publications to bring greater public attention to the museum's remarkable collections of the arts of America, Europe, Africa, Papua New Guinea and the Polar regions. At 70,000 objects, the Hood has one of the largest collections on any American college of university campus. The exhibition, Black Womanhood: Images, Icons, and Ideologies of the African Body, toured several US venues. Kennedy increased campus curricular use of works of art, with thousands of objects pulled from storage for classes annually. Numerous acquisitions were made with the museum's generous endowments, and he curated several exhibitions: including Wenda Gu: Forest of Stone Steles: Retranslation and Rewriting Tang Dynasty Poetry, Sean Scully: The Art of the Stripe, and Frank Stella: Irregular Polygons.\n\nPublications\nKennedy has written or edited a number of books on art, including:\n\nAlfred Chester Beatty and Ireland 1950-1968: A study in cultural politics, Glendale Press (1988), ISBN 978-0-907606-49-9\nDreams and responsibilities: The state and arts in independent Ireland, Arts Council of Ireland (1990), ISBN 978-0-906627-32-7\nJack B Yeats: Jack Butler Yeats, 1871-1957 (Lives of Irish Artists), Unipub (October 1991), ISBN 978-0-948524-24-0\nThe Anatomy Lesson: Art and Medicine (with Davis Coakley), National Gallery of Ireland (January 1992), ISBN 978-0-903162-65-4\nIreland: Art into History (with Raymond Gillespie), Roberts Rinehart Publishers (1994), ISBN 978-1-57098-005-3\nIrish Painting, Roberts Rinehart Publishers (November 1997),  ISBN 978-1-86059-059-7\nSean Scully: The Art of the Stripe, Hood Museum of Art (October 2008), ISBN 978-0-944722-34-3\nFrank Stella: Irregular Polygons, 1965-1966, Hood Museum of Art (October 2010), ISBN 978-0-944722-39-8\n\nHonors and achievements\nKennedy was awarded the Australian Centenary Medal in 2001 for service to Australian Society and its art. He is a trustee and treasurer of the Association of Art Museum Directors, a peer reviewer for the American Association of Museums and a member of the International Association of Art Critics. In 2013 he was appointed inaugural eminent professor at the University of Toledo and received an honorary doctorate from Lourdes University. Most recently, Kennedy received the 2014 Northwest Region, Ohio Art Education Association award for distinguished educator for art education.\n\n\n== Notes ==\nPassage 3:\nWilliam Dear\nWilliam Dear (born November 30, 1943) is a Canadian actor, director, producer and screenwriter.

She suggests he should follow the example of a salesman and friend of hers, Keenan Wallick (Don McGuire), who works at her company. Red gets a chance to prove himself worthy sooner than he had expected when he is fired from his job as a cleaner by his boss, Gordon Trist (Nicholas Joy), because he accidentally sets a trash can on fire in the line of duty, and smashes Trist's car window. Ann gives him a chance to show his skills as a door-to-door salesman for the Fuller Brush company, and he is teamed up with her friend Keenan. Both Ann and Red are unaware that Keenan himself has a romantic interest in Ann, and wants to get Red out of the way as soon as possible, so he can pursue Ann without competition. Keenan assigns Red a list of the hardest homes, and Red fails tremendously with his task of selling to an almost impossible potential customer. He has a comical run-in with a troublesome small boy, and a beautiful model at another home tries to seduce him.\nSeeing how unsuccessful Red's sales attempts are, Keenan comes up with the idea of a bet \u2013 the winner gets to pursue Ann without interference of the other man \u2013 which he suggests to Red. The bet is that Red won't be able to sell a single brush to the households on their run. Red takes the bet, and the next household on their run is the mansion of his old boss Gordon Trist. After Red tries to hide from Gordon and the groundskeeper, Gordon recognizes Red and sends him packing, but his wife comes after Red and buys ten brushes from him.\nRed returns to Anna and Keenan in high spirits, until he realizes he forgot to collect the payment money from Mrs. Trist. When Red comes back to the Trist home, he overhears a conversation between his former boss, Keenan, Gregory Cruckston (Donald Curtis) and a few other persons, as they discuss their involvement in a racketeering operation. Red is caught eavesdropping and knocked unconscious after he is brought into the house. When he comes back to life, Gordon has been murdered in the dark, and everyone present in the house is arrested by police lieutenant Quint (Arthur Space), all suspected of murder.\nRed is released since there is no evidence pointing to him being the killer, and when he comes home he discovers Mrs. Trist (Hillary Brooke) waiting for him with the money. Soon after, Sara arrives at his home, and shortly after that Freddie Trist (Ross Ford), Gordon's son, with two armed gangsters. The gangsters hold everyone hostage as they search in vain for the murder weapon that killed Gordon. Ann and Red conclude that the weapon must have been a Fuller brush, molded into a knife-looking object. Cruckston stops them from telling policeman Quint about the weapon, and it turns out Cruckston, who is Gordon's partner in crime, is the murderer. Ann and Red escape from him and his gangsters. Cruckston is arrested and Red is the hero of the day, winning Ann's heart in the process.\n\nCast\nRed Skelton as Red Jones\nJanet Blair as Ann Elliott\nDon McGuire as Keenan Wallick\nHillary Brooke as Mildred Trist\nAdele Jergens as Miss Sharmley\nRoss Ford as Freddie Trist\nTrudy Marshall as Sara Franzen\nNicholas Joy as Commissioner Gordon Trist\nDonald Curtis as Gregory Cruckston\nArthur Space as Lieutenant Quint\n\nProduction\nThe project had been in development for four years. Producer Simon got permission from the Fuller Brush company and wrote the story with Skelton in mind but was unable to secure studio interest until the success of Miracle on 34th Street (1947) showed the benefits of commercial tie-ins for feature films. He set the project up at Columbia conditional upon MGM agreeing to loan him out.\nProducer Edward Small was owed a favour by MGM as he agreed not to make a film called D'Artagnan to clash with their production of The Three Musketeers (1948). Small and Simon then purchased a story in the Saturday Evening Post by Roy Huggins.\nFuller Brush gave their final approval provided it was clear in the final movie that the character Skelton played was an independent dealer and not an employee of the Fuller Brush company.\n\nSee also\nThe Fuller Brush Girl\nPassage 4:\nWolf Rilla\nWolf Peter Rilla (16 March 1920 \u2013 19 October 2005) was a film director and writer of German background, although he worked mainly in the United Kingdom.Rilla is known for directing Village of the Damned (1960).

After starting his career as a door-to-door salesman and then broker, Miglin became a successful real estate developer. He was an early developer of business parks. His firm, at one point, proposed the construction of the Miglin-Beitler Skyneedle, which was planned to be the tallest building in the world. Miglin was murdered in his home in May 1997 by Andrew Cunanan, a spree\nkiller.\n\nLife and career\nMiglin was one of seven children born to a Roman Catholic family of Lithuanian descent. His father was a Czech immigrant who worked as a Central Illinois coal miner and also owned a tavern, ice cream parlor, and soda distributorship. Miglin was born in Westville, Illinois.Miglin trained as an air cadet during World War II, before attending the University of Illinois.Miglin began his professional career selling silverware door-to-door and pancake batter out of the trunk of his car. After this, he sold frozen cheesecakes, and subsequent to that sold TV dinners. He quit his salesman job to spend a six month trip across Europe. After this, he decided to make an effort to go into real estate to make substantial money.In 1956, at the age of 31, Miglin began his real estate career. In the early 1960s, he took a job as a broker with Chicago real estate magnate Arthur Rubloff. At Arthur Rubloff & Co., Miglin would first get involved with warehouse construction, later moving into office development. One of the projects he  was involved in was the development of the first two of the three towers at the President's Plaza office complex near Chicago's O'Hare International Airport. Miglin would later develop the third tower in 1985 with his firm Miglin-Beitler. Miglin was regarded as an early developer of the business park developments. He worked at Rubloff & Co. for 25 years.In 1959, Miglin married 20-year-old Marilyn Klecka, a Roman Catholic of Czech descent. Klecka, a successful entrepreneur known as the Queen of Makeovers, established a prominent perfume and cosmetics company and appeared on the Home Shopping Network. They would have two children together, Marlena (born 1968) and Duke Miglin (born 1971), the latter of whom would become an actor.Miglin formed a successful real estate development partnership with J. Paul Beitler, who had also worked at Rubloff & Co. Together, they founded the firm Miglin-Beitler Developments in 1982. Among the projects developed by the firm were Madison Plaza (200 West Madison), 181 West Madison Street, and Oakbrook Terrace Tower (the tallest building in Illinois outside of Chicago). In addition to constructing developments, the firm also managed properties.In 1988, Miglin-Beitler Developments unveiled plans to construct a 1,999 foot 125-floor skyscraper in Chicago to be called the Miglin-Beitler Skyneedle. This would have been the tallest building in the world at the time of its planned completion. However, the building was never built, with plans faltering during a 1990 downturn of Chicago's downtown office market. Miglin-Beitler had held hopes of resurrecting the project, but these hopes would be dashed by Miglin's murder.After Miglin-Beitler Developments began shifting its focus away from development and towards property management in the 1990s, Miglin gradually withdrew from the daily operations but still remained involved in the company.Miglin was a well-regarded figure in Chicago  and was known for his philanthropy.Miglin was murdered on May 4, 1997, by the spree killer Andrew Cunanan. Miglin's body was found in the garage of his home in Chicago's Gold Coast Historic District. He had been bound at the wrists, and his head was bound with tape, with only a breathing space under his nostrils. He had been tortured with a saw and a screwdriver, his ribs had been broken, he had been beaten and stabbed, and his throat had been slashed with a gardener's bow saw. Cunanan was already wanted in Minneapolis for murdering his friend Jeffrey Trail and his own ex-lover David Madson a few days earlier.\n\nLegacy\nMiglin-Beitler Developments merged in 1998 with the New York City real estate Howard and Edward Milstein to form the Chicago-based firm Miglin Beitler Real Estate (MBRE).

He was unable to gain employment due to his cerebral palsy, but refused to go on disability. Porter eventually convinced Watkins Incorporated to give him a door-to-door salesman job, selling its products on a seven-mile route in the Portland area. He eventually became Watkins' top seller, and worked for the company for over forty years.In 1995, the newspaper The Oregonian ran a feature story about Porter. The story of his optimistic determination made him the subject of media attention across the United States. He was featured in Reader's Digest and on ABC's 20/20.

She suggests he should follow the example of a salesman and friend of hers, Keenan Wallick (Don McGuire), who works at her company. Red gets a chance to prove himself worthy sooner than he had expected when he is fired from his job as a cleaner by his boss, Gordon Trist (Nicholas Joy), because he accidentally sets a trash can on fire in the line of duty, and smashes Trist's car window. Ann gives him a chance to show his skills as a door-to-door salesman for the Fuller Brush company, and he is teamed up with her friend Keenan. Both Ann and Red are unaware that Keenan himself has a romantic interest in Ann, and wants to get Red out of the way as soon as possible, so he can pursue Ann without competition. Keenan assigns Red a list of the hardest homes, and Red fails tremendously with his task of selling to an almost impossible potential customer. He has a comical run-in with a troublesome small boy, and a beautiful model at another home tries to seduce him.\nSeeing how unsuccessful Red's sales attempts are, Keenan comes up with the idea of a bet \u2013 the winner gets to pursue Ann without interference of the other man \u2013 which he suggests to Red. The bet is that Red won't be able to sell a single brush to the households on their run. Red takes the bet, and the next household on their run is the mansion of his old boss Gordon Trist. After Red tries to hide from Gordon and the groundskeeper, Gordon recognizes Red and sends him packing, but his wife comes after Red and buys ten brushes from him.\nRed returns to Anna and Keenan in high spirits, until he realizes he forgot to collect the payment money from Mrs. Trist. When Red comes back to the Trist home, he overhears a conversation between his former boss, Keenan, Gregory Cruckston (Donald Curtis) and a few other persons, as they discuss their involvement in a racketeering operation. Red is caught eavesdropping and knocked unconscious after he is brought into the house. When he comes back to life, Gordon has been murdered in the dark, and everyone present in the house is arrested by police lieutenant Quint (Arthur Space), all suspected of murder.\nRed is released since there is no evidence pointing to him being the killer, and when he comes home he discovers Mrs. Trist (Hillary Brooke) waiting for him with the money. Soon after, Sara arrives at his home, and shortly after that Freddie Trist (Ross Ford), Gordon's son, with two armed gangsters. The gangsters hold everyone hostage as they search in vain for the murder weapon that killed Gordon. Ann and Red conclude that the weapon must have been a Fuller brush, molded into a knife-looking object. Cruckston stops them from telling policeman Quint about the weapon, and it turns out Cruckston, who is Gordon's partner in crime, is the murderer. Ann and Red escape from him and his gangsters. Cruckston is arrested and Red is the hero of the day, winning Ann's heart in the process.\n\nCast\nRed Skelton as Red Jones\nJanet Blair as Ann Elliott\nDon McGuire as Keenan Wallick\nHillary Brooke as Mildred Trist\nAdele Jergens as Miss Sharmley\nRoss Ford as Freddie Trist\nTrudy Marshall as Sara Franzen\nNicholas Joy as Commissioner Gordon Trist\nDonald Curtis as Gregory Cruckston\nArthur Space as Lieutenant Quint\n\nProduction\nThe project had been in development for four years. Producer Simon got permission from the Fuller Brush company and wrote the story with Skelton in mind but was unable to secure studio interest until the success of Miracle on 34th Street (1947) showed the benefits of commercial tie-ins for feature films. He set the project up at Columbia conditional upon MGM agreeing to loan him out.\nProducer Edward Small was owed a favour by MGM as he agreed not to make a film called D'Artagnan to clash with their production of The Three Musketeers (1948). Small and Simon then purchased a story in the Saturday Evening Post by Roy Huggins.\nFuller Brush gave their final approval provided it was clear in the final movie that the character Skelton played was an independent dealer and not an employee of the Fuller Brush company.\n\nSee also\nThe Fuller Brush Girl\nPassage 4:\nWolf Rilla\nWolf Peter Rilla (16 March 1920 \u2013 19 October 2005) was a film director and writer of German background, although he worked mainly in the United Kingdom.Rilla is known for directing Village of the Damned (1960).

{"prompt": "Answer the question based on the given passages. Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\nBrian Kennedy (gallery director)\nBrian Patrick Kennedy (born 5 November 1961) is an Irish-born art museum director who has worked in Ireland and Australia, and now lives and works in the United States.  He was the director of the Peabody Essex Museum in Salem for 17 months, resigning December 31, 2020. He was the director of the Toledo Museum of Art in Ohio from 2010 to 2019. He was the director of the Hood Museum of Art from 2005 to 2010, and the National Gallery of Australia (Canberra) from 1997 to 2004.\n\nCareer\nBrian Kennedy currently lives and works in the United States after leaving Australia in 2005 to direct the Hood Museum of Art at Dartmouth College. In October 2010 he became the ninth Director of the Toledo Museum of Art. On 1 July 2019, he succeeded Dan Monroe as the executive director and CEO of the Peabody Essex Museum.\n\nEarly life and career in Ireland\nKennedy was born in Dublin and attended Clonkeen College. He received B.A. (1982), M.A. (1985) and PhD (1989) degrees from University College-Dublin, where he studied both art history and history.\nHe worked in the Irish Department of Education (1982), the European Commission, Brussels (1983), and in Ireland at the Chester Beatty Library (1983\u201385), Government Publications Office (1985\u201386), and Department of Finance (1986\u201389). He married Mary Fiona Carlin in 1988.He was Assistant Director at the National Gallery of Ireland in Dublin from 1989 to 1997. He was Chair of the Irish Association of Art Historians from 1996 to 1997, and of the Council of Australian Art Museum Directors from 2001 to 2003. In September 1997 he became Director of the National Gallery of Australia.\n\nNational Gallery of Australia (NGA)\nKennedy expanded the traveling exhibitions and loans program throughout Australia, arranged for several major shows of Australian art abroad, increased the number of exhibitions at the museum itself and oversaw the development of an extensive multi-media site.  Although he oversaw several years of the museum's highest ever annual visitation, he discontinued the emphasis of his predecessor, Betty Churcher, on showing \"blockbuster\" exhibitions.\nDuring his directorship, the NGA gained government support for improving the building and significant private donations and corporate sponsorship. However, the initial design for the building proved controversial generating a public dispute with the original architect on moral rights grounds.  As a result, the project was not delivered during Dr Kennedy's tenure, with a significantly altered design completed some years later.  Private funding supported two acquisitions of British art, including David Hockney's A Bigger Grand Canyon in 1999, and Lucian Freud's After C\u00e9zanne in 2001. Kennedy built on the established collections at the museum by acquiring the Holmgren-Spertus collection of Indonesian textiles; the Kenneth Tyler collection of editioned prints, screens, multiples and unique proofs; and the Australian Print Workshop Archive. He was also notable for campaigning for the construction of a new \"front\" entrance to the Gallery, facing King Edward Terrace, which was completed in 2010 (see reference to the building project above).\nKennedy's cancellation of the \"Sensation exhibition\" (scheduled at the NGA from 2 June 2000 to 13 August 2000) was controversial, and seen by some as censorship. He claimed that the decision was due to the exhibition being \"too close to the market\" implying that a national cultural institution cannot exhibit the private collection of a speculative art investor. However, there were other exhibitions at the NGA during his tenure, which could have raised similar concerns. The exhibition featured the privately owned Young British Artists works belonging to Charles Saatchi and attracted large attendances in London and Brooklyn. Its most controversial work was Chris Ofili's The Holy Virgin Mary, a painting which used elephant dung and was accused of being blasphemous. The then-mayor of New York, Rudolph Giuliani, campaigned against the exhibition, claiming it was \"Catholic-bashing\" and an \"aggressive, vicious, disgusting attack on religion.\" In November 1999, Kennedy cancelled the exhibition and stated that the events in New York had \"obscured discussion of the artistic merit of the works of art\". He has said that it \"was the toughest decision of my professional life, so far.\"Kennedy was also repeatedly questioned on his management of a range of issues during the Australian Government's Senate Estimates process - particularly on the NGA's occupational health and safety record and concerns about the NGA's twenty-year-old air-conditioning system. The air-conditioning was finally renovated in 2003. Kennedy announced in 2002 that he would not seek extension of his contract beyond 2004, accepting a seven-year term as had his two predecessors.He became a joint Irish-Australian citizen in 2003.\n\nToledo Museum of Art\nThe Toledo Museum of Art is known for its exceptional collections of European and American paintings and sculpture, glass, antiquities, artist books, Japanese prints and netsuke. The museum offers free admission and is recognized for its historical leadership in the field of art education.  During his tenure, Kennedy has focused the museum's art education efforts on visual literacy, which he defines as \"learning to read, understand and write visual language.\"   Initiatives have included baby and toddler tours, specialized training for all staff, docents, volunteers and the launch of a website, www.vislit.org. In November 2014, the museum hosted the International Visual Literacy Association (IVLA) conference, the first Museum to do so. Kennedy has been a frequent speaker on the topic, including 2010 and 2013 TEDx talks on visual and sensory literacy.\nKennedy has expressed an interest in expanding the museum's collection of contemporary art and art by indigenous peoples. Works by Frank Stella, Sean Scully, Jaume Plensa, Ravinder Reddy and Mary Sibande have been acquired.  In addition, the museum has made major acquisitions of Old Master paintings by Frans Hals and Luca Giordano.During his tenure the Toledo Museum of Art has announced the return of several objects from its collection due to claims the objects were stolen and/or illegally exported prior being sold to the museum.  In 2011 a Meissen sweetmeat stand was returned to Germany followed by an Etruscan Kalpis or water jug to Italy (2013), an Indian sculpture of Ganesha (2014) and an astrological compendium to Germany in 2015.\n\nHood Museum of Art\nKennedy became Director of the Hood Museum of Art in July 2005. During his tenure, he implemented a series of large and small-scale exhibitions and oversaw the production of more than 20 publications to bring greater public attention to the museum's remarkable collections of the arts of America, Europe, Africa, Papua New Guinea and the Polar regions. At 70,000 objects, the Hood has one of the largest collections on any American college of university campus. The exhibition, Black Womanhood: Images, Icons, and Ideologies of the African Body, toured several US venues. Kennedy increased campus curricular use of works of art, with thousands of objects pulled from storage for classes annually. Numerous acquisitions were made with the museum's generous endowments, and he curated several exhibitions: including Wenda Gu: Forest of Stone Steles: Retranslation and Rewriting Tang Dynasty Poetry, Sean Scully: The Art of the Stripe, and Frank Stella: Irregular Polygons.\n\nPublications\nKennedy has written or edited a number of books on art, including:\n\nAlfred Chester Beatty and Ireland 1950-1968: A study in cultural politics, Glendale Press (1988), ISBN 978-0-907606-49-9\nDreams and responsibilities: The state and arts in independent Ireland, Arts Council of Ireland (1990), ISBN 978-0-906627-32-7\nJack B Yeats: Jack Butler Yeats, 1871-1957 (Lives of Irish Artists), Unipub (October 1991), ISBN 978-0-948524-24-0\nThe Anatomy Lesson: Art and Medicine (with Davis Coakley), National Gallery of Ireland (January 1992), ISBN 978-0-903162-65-4\nIreland: Art into History (with Raymond Gillespie), Roberts Rinehart Publishers (1994), ISBN 978-1-57098-005-3\nIrish Painting, Roberts Rinehart Publishers (November 1997),  ISBN 978-1-86059-059-7\nSean Scully: The Art of the Stripe, Hood Museum of Art (October 2008), ISBN 978-0-944722-34-3\nFrank Stella: Irregular Polygons, 1965-1966, Hood Museum of Art (October 2010), ISBN 978-0-944722-39-8\n\nHonors and achievements\nKennedy was awarded the Australian Centenary Medal in 2001 for service to Australian Society and its art. He is a trustee and treasurer of the Association of Art Museum Directors, a peer reviewer for the American Association of Museums and a member of the International Association of Art Critics. In 2013 he was appointed inaugural eminent professor at the University of Toledo and received an honorary doctorate from Lourdes University.

N. Mathur\nS.N. Mathur was the Director of the Indian Intelligence Bureau between September 1975 and February 1980.

He was the director of the Peabody Essex Museum in Salem for 17 months, resigning December 31, 2020. He was the director of the Toledo Museum of Art in Ohio from 2010 to 2019. He was the director of the Hood Museum of Art from 2005 to 2010, and the National Gallery of Australia (Canberra) from 1997 to 2004.\n\nCareer\nBrian Kennedy currently lives and works in the United States after leaving Australia in 2005 to direct the Hood Museum of Art at Dartmouth College. In October 2010 he became the ninth Director of the Toledo Museum of Art. On 1 July 2019, he succeeded Dan Monroe as the executive director and CEO of the Peabody Essex Museum.\n\nEarly life and career in Ireland\nKennedy was born in Dublin and attended Clonkeen College. He received B.A. (1982), M.A. (1985) and PhD (1989) degrees from University College-Dublin, where he studied both art history and history.\nHe worked in the Irish Department of Education (1982), the European Commission, Brussels (1983), and in Ireland at the Chester Beatty Library (1983\u201385), Government Publications Office (1985\u201386), and Department of Finance (1986\u201389). He married Mary Fiona Carlin in 1988.He was Assistant Director at the National Gallery of Ireland in Dublin from 1989 to 1997. He was Chair of the Irish Association of Art Historians from 1996 to 1997, and of the Council of Australian Art Museum Directors from 2001 to 2003. In September 1997 he became Director of the National Gallery of Australia.\n\nNational Gallery of Australia (NGA)\nKennedy expanded the traveling exhibitions and loans program throughout Australia, arranged for several major shows of Australian art abroad, increased the number of exhibitions at the museum itself and oversaw the development of an extensive multi-media site.  Although he oversaw several years of the museum's highest ever annual visitation, he discontinued the emphasis of his predecessor, Betty Churcher, on showing \"blockbuster\" exhibitions.\nDuring his directorship, the NGA gained government support for improving the building and significant private donations and corporate sponsorship. However, the initial design for the building proved controversial generating a public dispute with the original architect on moral rights grounds.  As a result, the project was not delivered during Dr Kennedy's tenure, with a significantly altered design completed some years later.  Private funding supported two acquisitions of British art, including David Hockney's A Bigger Grand Canyon in 1999, and Lucian Freud's After C\u00e9zanne in 2001. Kennedy built on the established collections at the museum by acquiring the Holmgren-Spertus collection of Indonesian textiles; the Kenneth Tyler collection of editioned prints, screens, multiples and unique proofs; and the Australian Print Workshop Archive. He was also notable for campaigning for the construction of a new \"front\" entrance to the Gallery, facing King Edward Terrace, which was completed in 2010 (see reference to the building project above).\nKennedy's cancellation of the \"Sensation exhibition\" (scheduled at the NGA from 2 June 2000 to 13 August 2000) was controversial, and seen by some as censorship. He claimed that the decision was due to the exhibition being \"too close to the market\" implying that a national cultural institution cannot exhibit the private collection of a speculative art investor. However, there were other exhibitions at the NGA during his tenure, which could have raised similar concerns. The exhibition featured the privately owned Young British Artists works belonging to Charles Saatchi and attracted large attendances in London and Brooklyn. Its most controversial work was Chris Ofili's The Holy Virgin Mary, a painting which used elephant dung and was accused of being blasphemous. The then-mayor of New York, Rudolph Giuliani, campaigned against the exhibition, claiming it was \"Catholic-bashing\" and an \"aggressive, vicious, disgusting attack on religion.\" In November 1999, Kennedy cancelled the exhibition and stated that the events in New York had \"obscured discussion of the artistic merit of the works of art\". He has said that it \"was the toughest decision of my professional life, so far.\"Kennedy was also repeatedly questioned on his management of a range of issues during the Australian Government's Senate Estimates process - particularly on the NGA's occupational health and safety record and concerns about the NGA's twenty-year-old air-conditioning system. The air-conditioning was finally renovated in 2003. Kennedy announced in 2002 that he would not seek extension of his contract beyond 2004, accepting a seven-year term as had his two predecessors.He became a joint Irish-Australian citizen in 2003.\n\nToledo Museum of Art\nThe Toledo Museum of Art is known for its exceptional collections of European and American paintings and sculpture, glass, antiquities, artist books, Japanese prints and netsuke. The museum offers free admission and is recognized for its historical leadership in the field of art education.  During his tenure, Kennedy has focused the museum's art education efforts on visual literacy, which he defines as \"learning to read, understand and write visual language.\"   Initiatives have included baby and toddler tours, specialized training for all staff, docents, volunteers and the launch of a website, www.vislit.org. In November 2014, the museum hosted the International Visual Literacy Association (IVLA) conference, the first Museum to do so. Kennedy has been a frequent speaker on the topic, including 2010 and 2013 TEDx talks on visual and sensory literacy.\nKennedy has expressed an interest in expanding the museum's collection of contemporary art and art by indigenous peoples. Works by Frank Stella, Sean Scully, Jaume Plensa, Ravinder Reddy and Mary Sibande have been acquired.  In addition, the museum has made major acquisitions of Old Master paintings by Frans Hals and Luca Giordano.During his tenure the Toledo Museum of Art has announced the return of several objects from its collection due to claims the objects were stolen and/or illegally exported prior being sold to the museum.  In 2011 a Meissen sweetmeat stand was returned to Germany followed by an Etruscan Kalpis or water jug to Italy (2013), an Indian sculpture of Ganesha (2014) and an astrological compendium to Germany in 2015.\n\nHood Museum of Art\nKennedy became Director of the Hood Museum of Art in July 2005. During his tenure, he implemented a series of large and small-scale exhibitions and oversaw the production of more than 20 publications to bring greater public attention to the museum's remarkable collections of the arts of America, Europe, Africa, Papua New Guinea and the Polar regions. At 70,000 objects, the Hood has one of the largest collections on any American college of university campus. The exhibition, Black Womanhood: Images, Icons, and Ideologies of the African Body, toured several US venues. Kennedy increased campus curricular use of works of art, with thousands of objects pulled from storage for classes annually. Numerous acquisitions were made with the museum's generous endowments, and he curated several exhibitions: including Wenda Gu: Forest of Stone Steles: Retranslation and Rewriting Tang Dynasty Poetry, Sean Scully: The Art of the Stripe, and Frank Stella: Irregular Polygons.\n\nPublications\nKennedy has written or edited a number of books on art, including:\n\nAlfred Chester Beatty and Ireland 1950-1968: A study in cultural politics, Glendale Press (1988), ISBN 978-0-907606-49-9\nDreams and responsibilities: The state and arts in independent Ireland, Arts Council of Ireland (1990), ISBN 978-0-906627-32-7\nJack B Yeats: Jack Butler Yeats, 1871-1957 (Lives of Irish Artists), Unipub (October 1991), ISBN 978-0-948524-24-0\nThe Anatomy Lesson: Art and Medicine (with Davis Coakley), National Gallery of Ireland (January 1992), ISBN 978-0-903162-65-4\nIreland: Art into History (with Raymond Gillespie), Roberts Rinehart Publishers (1994), ISBN 978-1-57098-005-3\nIrish Painting, Roberts Rinehart Publishers (November 1997),  ISBN 978-1-86059-059-7\nSean Scully: The Art of the Stripe, Hood Museum of Art (October 2008), ISBN 978-0-944722-34-3\nFrank Stella: Irregular Polygons, 1965-1966, Hood Museum of Art (October 2010), ISBN 978-0-944722-39-8\n\nHonors and achievements\nKennedy was awarded the Australian Centenary Medal in 2001 for service to Australian Society and its art. He is a trustee and treasurer of the Association of Art Museum Directors, a peer reviewer for the American Association of Museums and a member of the International Association of Art Critics. In 2013 he was appointed inaugural eminent professor at the University of Toledo and received an honorary doctorate from Lourdes University. Most recently, Kennedy received the 2014 Northwest Region, Ohio Art Education Association award for distinguished educator for art education.\n\n\n== Notes ==\nPassage 7:\nPeter Levin\nPeter Levin is an American director of film, television and theatre.\n\nCareer\nSince 1967, Levin has amassed a large number of credits directing episodic television and television films.

N. Mathur\nS.N. Mathur was the Director of the Indian Intelligence Bureau between September 1975 and February 1980.

He was the director of the Peabody Essex Museum in Salem for 17 months, resigning December 31, 2020. He was the director of the Toledo Museum of Art in Ohio from 2010 to 2019. He was the director of the Hood Museum of Art from 2005 to 2010, and the National Gallery of Australia (Canberra) from 1997 to 2004.\n\nCareer\nBrian Kennedy currently lives and works in the United States after leaving Australia in 2005 to direct the Hood Museum of Art at Dartmouth College. In October 2010 he became the ninth Director of the Toledo Museum of Art. On 1 July 2019, he succeeded Dan Monroe as the executive director and CEO of the Peabody Essex Museum.\n\nEarly life and career in Ireland\nKennedy was born in Dublin and attended Clonkeen College. He received B.A. (1982), M.A. (1985) and PhD (1989) degrees from University College-Dublin, where he studied both art history and history.\nHe worked in the Irish Department of Education (1982), the European Commission, Brussels (1983), and in Ireland at the Chester Beatty Library (1983\u201385), Government Publications Office (1985\u201386), and Department of Finance (1986\u201389). He married Mary Fiona Carlin in 1988.He was Assistant Director at the National Gallery of Ireland in Dublin from 1989 to 1997. He was Chair of the Irish Association of Art Historians from 1996 to 1997, and of the Council of Australian Art Museum Directors from 2001 to 2003. In September 1997 he became Director of the National Gallery of Australia.\n\nNational Gallery of Australia (NGA)\nKennedy expanded the traveling exhibitions and loans program throughout Australia, arranged for several major shows of Australian art abroad, increased the number of exhibitions at the museum itself and oversaw the development of an extensive multi-media site.  Although he oversaw several years of the museum's highest ever annual visitation, he discontinued the emphasis of his predecessor, Betty Churcher, on showing \"blockbuster\" exhibitions.\nDuring his directorship, the NGA gained government support for improving the building and significant private donations and corporate sponsorship. However, the initial design for the building proved controversial generating a public dispute with the original architect on moral rights grounds.  As a result, the project was not delivered during Dr Kennedy's tenure, with a significantly altered design completed some years later.  Private funding supported two acquisitions of British art, including David Hockney's A Bigger Grand Canyon in 1999, and Lucian Freud's After C\u00e9zanne in 2001. Kennedy built on the established collections at the museum by acquiring the Holmgren-Spertus collection of Indonesian textiles; the Kenneth Tyler collection of editioned prints, screens, multiples and unique proofs; and the Australian Print Workshop Archive. He was also notable for campaigning for the construction of a new \"front\" entrance to the Gallery, facing King Edward Terrace, which was completed in 2010 (see reference to the building project above).\nKennedy's cancellation of the \"Sensation exhibition\" (scheduled at the NGA from 2 June 2000 to 13 August 2000) was controversial, and seen by some as censorship. He claimed that the decision was due to the exhibition being \"too close to the market\" implying that a national cultural institution cannot exhibit the private collection of a speculative art investor. However, there were other exhibitions at the NGA during his tenure, which could have raised similar concerns. The exhibition featured the privately owned Young British Artists works belonging to Charles Saatchi and attracted large attendances in London and Brooklyn. Its most controversial work was Chris Ofili's The Holy Virgin Mary, a painting which used elephant dung and was accused of being blasphemous. The then-mayor of New York, Rudolph Giuliani, campaigned against the exhibition, claiming it was \"Catholic-bashing\" and an \"aggressive, vicious, disgusting attack on religion.\" In November 1999, Kennedy cancelled the exhibition and stated that the events in New York had \"obscured discussion of the artistic merit of the works of art\". He has said that it \"was the toughest decision of my professional life, so far.\"Kennedy was also repeatedly questioned on his management of a range of issues during the Australian Government's Senate Estimates process - particularly on the NGA's occupational health and safety record and concerns about the NGA's twenty-year-old air-conditioning system. The air-conditioning was finally renovated in 2003. Kennedy announced in 2002 that he would not seek extension of his contract beyond 2004, accepting a seven-year term as had his two predecessors.He became a joint Irish-Australian citizen in 2003.\n\nToledo Museum of Art\nThe Toledo Museum of Art is known for its exceptional collections of European and American paintings and sculpture, glass, antiquities, artist books, Japanese prints and netsuke. The museum offers free admission and is recognized for its historical leadership in the field of art education.  During his tenure, Kennedy has focused the museum's art education efforts on visual literacy, which he defines as \"learning to read, understand and write visual language.\"   Initiatives have included baby and toddler tours, specialized training for all staff, docents, volunteers and the launch of a website, www.vislit.org. In November 2014, the museum hosted the International Visual Literacy Association (IVLA) conference, the first Museum to do so. Kennedy has been a frequent speaker on the topic, including 2010 and 2013 TEDx talks on visual and sensory literacy.\nKennedy has expressed an interest in expanding the museum's collection of contemporary art and art by indigenous peoples. Works by Frank Stella, Sean Scully, Jaume Plensa, Ravinder Reddy and Mary Sibande have been acquired.  In addition, the museum has made major acquisitions of Old Master paintings by Frans Hals and Luca Giordano.During his tenure the Toledo Museum of Art has announced the return of several objects from its collection due to claims the objects were stolen and/or illegally exported prior being sold to the museum.  In 2011 a Meissen sweetmeat stand was returned to Germany followed by an Etruscan Kalpis or water jug to Italy (2013), an Indian sculpture of Ganesha (2014) and an astrological compendium to Germany in 2015.\n\nHood Museum of Art\nKennedy became Director of the Hood Museum of Art in July 2005. During his tenure, he implemented a series of large and small-scale exhibitions and oversaw the production of more than 20 publications to bring greater public attention to the museum's remarkable collections of the arts of America, Europe, Africa, Papua New Guinea and the Polar regions. At 70,000 objects, the Hood has one of the largest collections on any American college of university campus. The exhibition, Black Womanhood: Images, Icons, and Ideologies of the African Body, toured several US venues. Kennedy increased campus curricular use of works of art, with thousands of objects pulled from storage for classes annually. Numerous acquisitions were made with the museum's generous endowments, and he curated several exhibitions: including Wenda Gu: Forest of Stone Steles: Retranslation and Rewriting Tang Dynasty Poetry, Sean Scully: The Art of the Stripe, and Frank Stella: Irregular Polygons.\n\nPublications\nKennedy has written or edited a number of books on art, including:\n\nAlfred Chester Beatty and Ireland 1950-1968: A study in cultural politics, Glendale Press (1988), ISBN 978-0-907606-49-9\nDreams and responsibilities: The state and arts in independent Ireland, Arts Council of Ireland (1990), ISBN 978-0-906627-32-7\nJack B Yeats: Jack Butler Yeats, 1871-1957 (Lives of Irish Artists), Unipub (October 1991), ISBN 978-0-948524-24-0\nThe Anatomy Lesson: Art and Medicine (with Davis Coakley), National Gallery of Ireland (January 1992), ISBN 978-0-903162-65-4\nIreland: Art into History (with Raymond Gillespie), Roberts Rinehart Publishers (1994), ISBN 978-1-57098-005-3\nIrish Painting, Roberts Rinehart Publishers (November 1997),  ISBN 978-1-86059-059-7\nSean Scully: The Art of the Stripe, Hood Museum of Art (October 2008), ISBN 978-0-944722-34-3\nFrank Stella: Irregular Polygons, 1965-1966, Hood Museum of Art (October 2010), ISBN 978-0-944722-39-8\n\nHonors and achievements\nKennedy was awarded the Australian Centenary Medal in 2001 for service to Australian Society and its art. He is a trustee and treasurer of the Association of Art Museum Directors, a peer reviewer for the American Association of Museums and a member of the International Association of Art Critics. In 2013 he was appointed inaugural eminent professor at the University of Toledo and received an honorary doctorate from Lourdes University.

{"prompt": "Answer the question based on the given passages. Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\nBattle for Brooklyn\nBattle for Brooklyn is a 2011 documentary that follows the stories of a Brooklyn neighborhood as the residents fight to save their homes from being destroyed by an impending real estate project. The film attempts to show the unjust outcomes that are possible when moneyed interests partner up with government entities to outweigh the rights of citizens.\n\nFilm content\nSet in the years between 2003 and 2011, the story follows graphic designer Daniel Goldstein, the last defiantly remaining homeowner in his building, as he battles Bruce Ratner's Forest City real estate company and their plans to complete the Atlantic Yards Project in the Prospect Heights neighborhood of Brooklyn. The massive building project \u2013 according to the filmmakers, the densest real estate development in U.S. history \u2013 required the procurement of 22 acres of land, and would bring a sports complex to house the New Jersey Nets along with 16 high-rise buildings to the heart of Brooklyn. Initially tasked with filling the behemoth 22 acre complex was architect Frank Gehry, who NPR calls \"American architecture's prince of wasted space\". The film documents that the land was obtained by the developers through various means including the controversial declaration of the buildings in the area as \"blighted\", and the utilization of eminent domain to seize land from businesses and homeowners in the proposed project area.\nDirector Michael Galinsky explained that it was their intention to create an immersive experience devoid of excessive commentary by \"talking heads\" in order to allow the viewer some latitude to experience the events of the film for themselves.  The result of this immersive experience after 7 years of filming can be seen as a character study of Daniel Goldstein \u2013 in the background of the story of the formation of Develop Don't Destroy Brooklyn and the fight against the development, Goldstein, through the course of the filming, experiences personal triumphs and great sadness, including the death of his mother, the breakup with his fianc\u00e9e, the formation of a new relationship, and the birth of his child. The film documents his \"evolution from a bewildered property owner to sophisticated spokesman and property rights activist.\"The formation of the community activism group Develop Don't Destroy Brooklyn (DDDB) with the help of NYC Councilmember Letitia James helped bring Goldstein's cause into the public eye, quickly gaining the support of Brooklyn-based actors like Steve Buscemi, Rosie Perez and John Turturro, and conservative columnist George Will.\n\nProduction\nThe film, which was shortlisted for an Academy Award in 2012 for the 84th Academy Awards, was produced and directed by Michael Galinsky and Suki Hawley. Hawley and Galinsky began production in 2003, when they came across a flyer explaining the protest. Galinsky started shooting the very same afternoon. The film's importance extends beyond Goldstein's fight against the abuse of eminent domain, Galinsky describes the film as being \"really about the people retaking narratives from the media which is faltering ... in these situations.\"  The film received its initial financing from the New York-based non-profit Moving Picture Institute.In a 2011 interview, Galinsky described the events that led to the start of filming:\n\nI saw an article in the paper that said, \"A development project is coming to Brooklyn. Hooray!\" I thought, \"This seems a little bit weird.\" I knew the area it was coming to. It seemed it was impossible. It's in the middle of playgrounds and neighborhoods. My daughter went to daycare a block from there. So, when I saw a flyer saying, \"stop the project,\" I immediately picked it up, called the number on the flyer, and the woman who answered was Patti Hagan, who I could tell right away was an interesting character. So I started shooting that afternoon. That was eight years ago.\nOn April 30, 2011, Battle for Brooklyn premiered in Toronto at the HotDocs Film Festival.\n\nCritical reception\nAndrew O'Hehir of Salon says of the film's appeal, \"No doubt \"Battle for Brooklyn\" will be of most interest to New Yorkers, and particularly to people who live or work in the city's most populous borough. But the film's basic situation \u2014 local residents and community activists vs. the development schemes of major politicians and big business \u2014 is an archetypal element of urban life, one that can be found in almost any city, large or small, from Maine to California.\"S. James Snyder of Time Out New York writes, \"Nothing propels a documentary like injustice, and Michael Galinsky and Suki Hawley's infuriating chronicle of an outer-borough David-versus-Goliath saga plays like a marathon of inequity.\"Gary Goldstein of the Los Angeles Times said that although the film is \"not exactly even-handed, the movie proves a deft look at a reluctant crusader and how financial sway and political override can so effectively trump the power of the average citizen.\"\n\nAwards and recognition\n2011 Best Documentary & Best Film \u2013 Brooklyn Film Festival\nNew York Times Critics' Pick\n\nFilm Festivals\n2011 Chicago Underground Film Festival\n2011 Rooftop Films Summer Series\n2011 Brooklyn Film Festival (United States Premiere)\n2011 HotDocs (World Premiere)\nPassage 2:\nList of artists from Brooklyn\nBrooklyn is the most populous borough of New York City, New York.

The play first appeared on the Elgin Hour and was directed by Sidney Lumet.\nThe film, starring James Whitmore and John Cassavetes, also featured actor Sal Mineo, who had previously appeared in Rebel Without A Cause.  From his role in Crime in the Streets, Mineo earned a Hollywood nickname, \"The Switchblade Kid.\" Malcolm Atterbury, Virginia Gregg and future director Mark Rydell had prominent roles.\nSiegel adapted the play to a film by expanding some sequences but keeping much of the same cast.  His credited dialogue coach on the film was Sam Peckinpah.\n\nPlot\nAfter a rumble between New York City street gangs, the Hornets and Dukes, a youth is taken captive and threatened with a zip gun by Lenny Daniels, one of the Hornets.

The film attempts to show the unjust outcomes that are possible when moneyed interests partner up with government entities to outweigh the rights of citizens.\n\nFilm content\nSet in the years between 2003 and 2011, the story follows graphic designer Daniel Goldstein, the last defiantly remaining homeowner in his building, as he battles Bruce Ratner's Forest City real estate company and their plans to complete the Atlantic Yards Project in the Prospect Heights neighborhood of Brooklyn. The massive building project \u2013 according to the filmmakers, the densest real estate development in U.S. history \u2013 required the procurement of 22 acres of land, and would bring a sports complex to house the New Jersey Nets along with 16 high-rise buildings to the heart of Brooklyn. Initially tasked with filling the behemoth 22 acre complex was architect Frank Gehry, who NPR calls \"American architecture's prince of wasted space\". The film documents that the land was obtained by the developers through various means including the controversial declaration of the buildings in the area as \"blighted\", and the utilization of eminent domain to seize land from businesses and homeowners in the proposed project area.\nDirector Michael Galinsky explained that it was their intention to create an immersive experience devoid of excessive commentary by \"talking heads\" in order to allow the viewer some latitude to experience the events of the film for themselves.  The result of this immersive experience after 7 years of filming can be seen as a character study of Daniel Goldstein \u2013 in the background of the story of the formation of Develop Don't Destroy Brooklyn and the fight against the development, Goldstein, through the course of the filming, experiences personal triumphs and great sadness, including the death of his mother, the breakup with his fianc\u00e9e, the formation of a new relationship, and the birth of his child. The film documents his \"evolution from a bewildered property owner to sophisticated spokesman and property rights activist.\"The formation of the community activism group Develop Don't Destroy Brooklyn (DDDB) with the help of NYC Councilmember Letitia James helped bring Goldstein's cause into the public eye, quickly gaining the support of Brooklyn-based actors like Steve Buscemi, Rosie Perez and John Turturro, and conservative columnist George Will.\n\nProduction\nThe film, which was shortlisted for an Academy Award in 2012 for the 84th Academy Awards, was produced and directed by Michael Galinsky and Suki Hawley. Hawley and Galinsky began production in 2003, when they came across a flyer explaining the protest. Galinsky started shooting the very same afternoon. The film's importance extends beyond Goldstein's fight against the abuse of eminent domain, Galinsky describes the film as being \"really about the people retaking narratives from the media which is faltering ... in these situations.\"  The film received its initial financing from the New York-based non-profit Moving Picture Institute.In a 2011 interview, Galinsky described the events that led to the start of filming:\n\nI saw an article in the paper that said, \"A development project is coming to Brooklyn. Hooray!\" I thought, \"This seems a little bit weird.\" I knew the area it was coming to. It seemed it was impossible. It's in the middle of playgrounds and neighborhoods. My daughter went to daycare a block from there. So, when I saw a flyer saying, \"stop the project,\" I immediately picked it up, called the number on the flyer, and the woman who answered was Patti Hagan, who I could tell right away was an interesting character. So I started shooting that afternoon. That was eight years ago.\nOn April 30, 2011, Battle for Brooklyn premiered in Toronto at the HotDocs Film Festival.\n\nCritical reception\nAndrew O'Hehir of Salon says of the film's appeal, \"No doubt \"Battle for Brooklyn\" will be of most interest to New Yorkers, and particularly to people who live or work in the city's most populous borough. But the film's basic situation \u2014 local residents and community activists vs. the development schemes of major politicians and big business \u2014 is an archetypal element of urban life, one that can be found in almost any city, large or small, from Maine to California.\"S. James Snyder of Time Out New York writes, \"Nothing propels a documentary like injustice, and Michael Galinsky and Suki Hawley's infuriating chronicle of an outer-borough David-versus-Goliath saga plays like a marathon of inequity.\"Gary Goldstein of the Los Angeles Times said that although the film is \"not exactly even-handed, the movie proves a deft look at a reluctant crusader and how financial sway and political override can so effectively trump the power of the average citizen.\"\n\nAwards and recognition\n2011 Best Documentary & Best Film \u2013 Brooklyn Film Festival\nNew York Times Critics' Pick\n\nFilm Festivals\n2011 Chicago Underground Film Festival\n2011 Rooftop Films Summer Series\n2011 Brooklyn Film Festival (United States Premiere)\n2011 HotDocs (World Premiere)\nPassage 2:\nList of artists from Brooklyn\nBrooklyn is the most populous borough of New York City, New York.

{"prompt": "Answer the question based on the given passages. Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\nImmilla of Turin\nImmilla (also Emilia, Immula, Ermengard, or Irmgard) (born c. 1020; died January 1078) was a duchess consort of Swabia by marriage to Otto III, Duke of Swabia, and a margravine of Meissen by marriage to Ekbert I of Meissen. She was regent of Meissen during the minority of her son, Ekbert II.\n\nLife\nImmilla was the daughter of Ulric Manfred II of Turin and Bertha of Milan and thereby a member of the Arduinici dynasty. Her older sister was Adelaide of Susa.\nHer first husband was Otto III, Duke of Swabia, whom she married c. 1036. After Otto's death in September 1057, Immilla married again (c.1058). Her second husband was Ekbert I of Meissen.In 1067, shortly before his death, Ekbert I attempted to repudiate Immilla in order to marry Adela of Louvain, daughter of Lambert II, Count of Louvain and the widow of Otto I, Margrave of Meissen. After Ekbert's death in 1068, Immilla spent some time at the imperial court with her niece Bertha, before returning to Italy. It is possible that she acted as regent for her young son, Ekbert II, at this time.Immilla died in Turin in January 10, 1078. She is sometimes said to have become a nun before her death.\n\nMarriages and children\nWith her first husband, Otto, Immilla had five daughters:\n\nBertha (or Alberada) (died 1 April 1103), married firstly Herman II, Count of Kastl, and married secondly Frederick, Count of Kastl\nGisela, inherited Kulmbach and Plassenburg, married Arnold IV, Count of Andechs\nJudith (died 1104), married firstly Conrad I, Duke of Bavaria, and secondly Botho, Count of Pottenstein\nEilika, abbess of Niederm\u00fcnster\nBeatrice (1040\u20131140), inherited Schweinfurt, married Henry II, Count of Hildrizhausen and Margrave of the NordgauWith her second husband, Ekbert I, Immilla had the following children:\n\nEkbert II\nGertrude\nPassage 2:\nVolkold\nVolkold of Meissen (also Wolcold, Folcold, Folchold, Volhold, Volkhuld, Volchrad, Vocco; died 23 August 992) was the second Bishop of Meissen.\n\nLife\nBefore his elevation to the episcopate all that is known of Volkold's life is that he was at the court of Emperor Otto I as one of the tutors of the Emperor's son, the  future Otto II. He seems to have been appointed Bishop of Meissen in 969. Before his elevation Volkold was the patron of the young Willigis, later Saint Willigis, and used his influence to obtain for him a position in the Imperial service. In 972 Volkold attended a synod in Ingelheim.When Boleslaus II, Duke of Bohemia, besieged the Albrechtsburg and the town of Meissen in 984 in support of the Imperial ambitions of Henry II of Bavaria after the death of Otto II, Volkold was obliged to seek refuge from the Sorbs in Erfurt, under the protection of Willigis, and was not able to return to his badly-damaged headquarters until after the re-conquest by Ekkehard I, Margrave of Meissen, in 987. In that year he put the diocese under Imperial protection.Doubtless as compensation for the bishopric's many losses he received from Otto II several gifts of estates, tolls and uses.While on a visit to Prague he suffered a stroke, on Good Friday 992, and returned paralysed to Meissen, where he died on 23 August and was buried.\nPassage 3:\nAlbrecht I of Meissen\nAlbrecht I of Meissen (died 1 August 1152) was Bishop of Meissen from 1150 to 1152.\n\nLife\nAlbrecht I is not extensively documented. He was supposedly from a family of the Sorbian nobility. Before his elevation to the bishopric he was a cathedral provost. Otto von Freising mentions Albrecht in 1151 in connection with the dispute between Friedrich II of Berg and Herman van Horne over the office of bishop of Utrecht.\nWith the agreement of the Pope, the bishopric of Meissen, like that of Naumburg, was under the protection of Burggraf Conrad I of Meissen, in return for which the bishops were expected to undertake appropriate tasks from time to time. At the beginning of 1152 Conrad III entrusted Albrecht, who had the reputation of being talented at languages, with a diplomatic mission to the Byzantine Emperor Manuel I Komnenos. The bishop died either on the way to Constantinople or in the city itself.\nPassage 4:\nJohn I, Duke of Brunswick-Grubenhagen\nJohn I, Duke of Brunswick-Grubenhagen (born: before 1322; died: 23 May 1367) was provost of the St. Alexandri Minster in Einbeck.\nHe was the son of Duke Henry I \"the Marvelous\" of Brunswick-Grubenhagen and his wife Agnes of Meissen, daughter of Margrave Albert II of Meissen.\nPassage 5:\nAgnes of Waiblingen\nAgnes of Waiblingen (1072/73 \u2013 24 September 1143), also known as Agnes of Germany, Agnes of Poitou and Agnes of Saarbr\u00fccken, was a member of the Salian imperial family.  Through her first marriage, she was Duchess of Swabia; through her second marriage, she was Margravine of Austria.\n\nFamily\nShe was the daughter of Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor, and Bertha of Savoy.\n\nFirst marriage\nIn 1079, aged seven, Agnes was betrothed to Frederick, a member of the Hohenstaufen dynasty; at the same time, Henry IV invested Frederick as the new duke of Swabia. The couple married in 1086, when Agnes was fourteen. They had twelve children, eleven of whom were named in a document found in the abbey of Lorsch:\n\nHedwig-Eilike (1088\u20131110), married Friedrich, Count of Legenfeld\nBertha-Bertrade (1089\u20131120), married Adalbert, Count of Elchingen\nFrederick II of Swabia\nHildegard\nConrad III of Germany\nGisihild-Gisela\nHeinrich (1096\u20131105)\nBeatrix (1098\u20131130), became an abbess\nKunigunde-Cuniza (1100\u20131120/1126), wife of Henry X, Duke of Bavaria (1108\u20131139)\nSophia, married Konrad II, Count of Pfitzingen\nFides-Gertrude, married Hermann III, Count Palatine of the Rhine\nRichildis, married Hugh I, Count of Roucy\n\nSecond marriage\nFollowing Frederick's death in 1105, Agnes married Leopold III (1073\u20131136), the Margrave of Austria (1095\u20131136). According to a legend, a veil lost by Agnes and found by Leopold years later while hunting was the instigation for him to found the Klosterneuburg Monastery.Their children were:\nAdalbert\nLeopold IV\nHenry II of Austria\nBerta, married Heinrich of Regensburg\nAgnes, \"one of the most famous beauties of her time\", married Wladyslaw II of Poland\nErnst\nUta, wife of Liutpold von Plain\nOtto of Freising, bishop and biographer\nConrad, Bishop of Passau, and Archbishop of Salzburg\nElisabeth, married Hermann, Count of Winzenburg\nJudith, m. c. 1133 William V of Montferrat. Their children formed an important Crusading dynasty.\nGertrude, married Vladislav II of BohemiaAccording to the Continuation of the Chronicles of Klosterneuburg, there may have been up to seven other children (possibly from multiple births) stillborn or who died in infancy.\nIn 2013, documentation regarding the results of DNA testing of the remains of the family buried in Klosterneuburg Abbey strongly favor that Adalbert was the son of Leopold and Agnes.In 1125, Agnes' brother, Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor, died childless, leaving Agnes and her children as heirs to the Salian dynasty's immense allodial estates, including Waiblingen.\nIn 1127, Agnes' second son, Konrad III, was elected as the rival King of Germany by those opposed to the Saxon party's Lothar III. When Lothar died in 1137, Konrad was elected to the position.\nPassage 6:\nMargaret of Sicily\nMargaret of Sicily (also called Margaret of Hohenstaufen or Margaret of Germany) (1 December 1241, in Foggia \u2013 8 August 1270, in Frankfurt-am-Main) was a Princess of Sicily and Germany, and a member of the House of Hohenstaufen. By marriage she was Landgravine of Thuringia and Countess Palatine of Saxony (German: Landgr\u00e4fin von Th\u00fcringen und Pfalzgr\u00e4fin von Sachsen).\nShe was the daughter of Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor, King of Sicily and Germany, by his third wife, Isabella of England.  Her paternal grandparents were Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor and Constance of Sicily. Her maternal grandparents were John of England and Isabella of Angoul\u00eame.\n\nBirth\nThe date of her birth is difficult to ascertain because there is controversy over the exact number of children borne by her mother. Some sources say that she was the first or second child, born by the end of 1237; others say that she was the last child, born in December 1241, when Isabella died in childbirth. Historians commonly accept the latter date.\n\nLife\nShortly after her birth (1242), Margaret was betrothed to Albert \"the Degenerate\", eldest son and heir of Henry III \"the Illustrious\", Margrave of Meissen. The marriage took place in June 1255, the bride receiving Pleissnerland (the towns of Altenburg, Zwickau, Chemnitz and Leisnig) as her dowry.\nThe couple settled at his residence in Eckartsberga and later moved to Wartburg, where she bore five children: three sons (Henry, Frederick and Dietzmann) and two daughters (Margaret and Agnes). Through her second son Frederick \u2013 later Margrave of Meissen \u2013 Margaret was the direct ancestor of the Electors and Kings of Saxony and English Queen consorts Margaret of Anjou and Anne of Cleves.\nIn 1265 her husband received the titles of Landgrave of Thuringia and Count Palatine of Saxony (German: Pfalzgr\u00e4f von Sachsen) after the abdication of his father, who retained control of Meissen.\nAfter the execution of her nephew Conradin (29 October 1268), Margaret, as the next legitimate relative, became the rightful Queen of Sicily and the general heiress of the Hohenstaufen claims over the Duchy of Swabia and the Kingdom of Jerusalem (despite the fact she was not descended from the Kings of Jerusalem, her father Frederick II had claimed the kingdom for himself). Her son Frederick assumed by some time this titles on her right.\nAfter discovering the adultery of her husband with Kunigunde of Eisenberg, Margaret left Wartburg; according to a legend, before her departure she bit her son Frederick in the cheek; he was called henceforth Frederick the Bitten (de: Friedrich der Gebissene). The flight took place on 24 June 1270. Margaret went to Frankfurt-am-Main and was supported there by the citizens. She died there six weeks later.\n\nIssue\nMargaret and Albert had five children:\n\nHenry (b. 21 March 1256 \u2013 d. 25 January/23 July? 1282), inherited the Pleissnerland in 1274.\nFrederick (b. 1257 \u2013 d.

On 7 September 1356, at the age of twenty six, she married Frederick V, Burgrave of Nuremberg in Jena. In 1357 her husband succeeded to the title, and from that time until her death in 1375, she was styled as Burgravine of Nuremberg. Together Frederick and Elisabeth had nine children, seven girls and two boys, who survived to adulthood:\n\nElisabeth (1358\u201326 July 1411, Heidelberg), married in Amberg 1374 to Rupert of Germany.\nBeatrix (c. 1362, Nuremberg\u201310 June 1414, Perchtoldsdorf), married in Vienna 1375 Duke Albert III of Austria\nAnna (c. 1364\u2013after 10 May 1392), a nun in Seusslitz.\nAgnes (1366 \u2013 22 May 1432), Convent in Hof (1376\u20131386) married in Konstance 1386 Baron Friedrich of Daber, Returned to Convent in Hof (1406) Abbess in Hof (1411\u20131432).\nJohn (c. 1369\u201311 June 1420, Plassenburg).\nFrederick (1371\u20131440) was the last Burgrave of Nuremberg from 1397 to 1427 (as Frederick VI), Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach from 1398, Margrave of Brandenburg-Kulmbach from 1420, and Elector of Brandenburg (as Frederick I) from 1415 until his death.

In 1184, she was elected successor to Princess-Abbess Adelaide III.\nAgnes was a significant patron of art, as well as miniaturist and engraver. During her reign, the nuns of Quedlinburg Abbey made large curtains that are indispensable in the study of the art industry of the era. She also wrote and illuminated books for divine service. However, her greatest masterpiece was the manufacture of wall-hangings, of which one set was intended to be sent to the Pope; this tapestry is the best preserved piece of Romanesque textile. She was known for combining her embroidering with her literary composition and even composed Latin verses on a piece of tapestry.She died in Quedlinburg Abbey on 21 January 1203.\n\nLegacy\nAgnes is a featured figure on Judy Chicago's installation piece The Dinner Party, being represented as one of the 999 names on the Heritage Floor.\nPassage 9:\nAlbert, Margrave of Meissen (1934\u20132012)\nPrince Albert Joseph Maria Franz-Xaver of Saxony, Duke of Saxony, Margrave of Meissen (30 November 1934 \u2013 6 October 2012) was the head of the Royal House of Saxony and a German historian. The fourth child and youngest son of Friedrich Christian, Margrave of Meissen and his wife Princess Elisabeth Helene of Thurn and Taxis, he was the younger brother of Maria Emanuel, Margrave of Meissen, who was his predecessor as head of the Royal House of Saxony. Had he been King he would have been known as Albert II\n\nLife\nAlbert received his secondary education at the Federal Gymnasium in Bregenz, Austria. He passed his matura in 1954.  His parents and their children then moved to Munich, with support from his mother's relatives from the Thurn und Taxis dynasty.  In Munich, Albert studied at the Ludwig Maximilian University. He initially studied macroeconomics, and later switched to history and ethnography.  On 13 February 1961, he received his PhD for a thesis on his great-great-grandfather, King John of Saxony, and his reform of Saxon commercial law.\nOn 30 January 1960 the Studiengruppe f\u00fcr S\u00e4chsische Geschichte und Kultur e.V. (\"Study group for Saxon history and culture\") was founded by Albert together with his parents, his elder brother Maria Emanuel, some other Saxon nobles, the Chapter of the Military Order of St. Henry, the chapter of the association of people from Dresden, and the association of Heimatvertriebene in the history department of the University of Munich. This study group became one of the largest historical societies in West Germany. After completing his studies, Albert worked as a historian and referent. He studied the history of the Duchy of Saxony and the Kingdom of Saxony, in particular the relationship of Saxony to Bavaria.\nAt times, he was vice president of the Bund der Mitteldeutschen (\"Association of Central Germans\").  In 1972, he joined the Mitteldeutschen Kulturrat e.V. (\"Central German Culture Council\"), where he represented the interests of the Free State of Saxony.\nIn the summer of 1982, he was allowed to visit Saxony for the first time since his youth. He visited again in 1983 and 1985. He was then not allowed to enter the German Democratic Republic again, for unknown reasons, until 1989/1990. On 22 January 1990, he participated in a Monday demonstration in Dresden and was unexpectedly asked to address the crowd. He told his audience about their task to rebuild Saxony and ended with the words \"Long live Saxony, Germany, Europe and the western-Christian culture.\"\nIn the subsequent elections for the Saxon parliament, he ran as a DSU candidate; he was not elected, nor did the newly elected government of Saxony employ him as an advisor. After the German reunification, he has tried to reclaim some of his family's former possessions.\n\nMarriage\nAlbert morganatically wed Elmira Henke in a civil ceremony on 10 April 1980 in Munich, and in a religious ceremony on 12 April 1980, in the Theatine Church, also in Munich. Elmira assisted Albert with his scientific and historical studies; she specialized in ethnographic topics. Albert and Elmira had no children.\n\nSuccession\nThe headship of the Royal House of Saxony is a matter of dispute in the Saxon Royal Family. The conflict stems from the fact that the last undisputed head of the house Maria Emanuel, Margrave of Meissen, and the other princes of his generation either had no children or, in the case of Prince Timo, had children (including Prince R\u00fcdiger of Saxony) who were deemed not to be members of the Royal House of Saxony.The first designated dynastic heir of Maria Emanuel was his and Albert's nephew Prince Johannes of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, only son of their youngest sister Princess Mathilde of Saxony by her marriage to Prince Johannes Heinrich of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, dynast of a ducal branch of the House of Wettin senior patrilineally to the royal branch. After the early death of Prince Johannes, the heirless Maria Emanuel then considered as potential heir another nephew, Alexander Afif, the eldest son of Princess Anna of Saxony and her husband Roberto Afif, despite the Afif-Saxony marriage being contrary to the traditional laws of the House of Saxony which required equal marriages for descendants to inherit dynastic rights. On 14 May 1997 the Margrave of Meissen proposed his nephew Alexander Afif as heir and drew up a document that was signed by the other male and female members of the Royal House (including previously non-dynastic spouses of princes) setting out that Alexander would succeed on his death. The document was signed by: Anastasia, Margravine of Meissen, Prince Albert and his wife, n\u00e9e Elmira Henke, Prince Dedo (for himself, for his brother Prince Gero and for their stepmother n\u00e9e Virginia Dulon \u2013 his brother Prince Timo had died in 1982), the Princesses Maria Josepha, Anna and Mathilde, and Prince Timo's third wife, n\u00e9e Erina Eilts. Two years later on 1 July 1999 the Margrave adopted his nephew Alexander Afif, who had used the title Alexander, Prince of Saxe-Gessaphe since 1972, based on his patrilineal descent from the once-sovereign Lebanese \"Afif\" (or Gessaphe) dynasty.The 1997 agreement proved to be controversial and in the summer of 2002 three of the signatories, Princes Albert, Dedo and Gero (the latter consented via proxy but had not personally signed the document) retracted their support for the agreement. The following year Prince Albert wrote that it is through Prince R\u00fcdiger and his sons that the direct line of the Albertine branch of the House of Wettin will continue, and thus avoid becoming extinct. Until his death, however, the Margrave, as head of the former dynasty, continued to regard his nephew and adopted son, Prince Alexander, as the contractual heir entitled to succeed.Immediately following the death of Maria Emanuel in July 2012, Prince Albert assumed the position of head of the Royal House of Saxony. According to the Eurohistory Journal prior to the Margrave's funeral Albert met with his nephew, Alexander, and recognised him as Margrave of Meissen. However this claim is contradicted by Albert himself in his final interview, given after the funeral, where he states that he needs recognition as Margrave of Meissen. Prince Alexander, citing the 1997 agreement, has also assumed the headship. Albert, Margrave of Meissen died at a hospital in Munich on 6 October 2012 at the age of 77.\nPrior to the requiem for Margrave Maria Emanuel, R\u00fcdiger, who had sought to be recognised by his cousin as a dynastic member of the House of Saxony but was refused, conducted a demonstration outside the cathedral with Saxon royalists in protest against the late Margrave Maria Emanuel's decision to appoint Alexander as heir. \nThe family website of Prince R\u00fcdiger states that, prior to his death, Albert determined R\u00fcdiger to be his successor and instituted a clear succession plan. On this basis following Albert's death Prince R\u00fcdiger assumed the headship of the house.\n\nAncestry\nPublications by Prince Albert\nDie Reform der s\u00e4chsischen Gewerbegesetzgebung (1840\u20131861), PhD thesis, University of Munich, 1970\nDresden, Weidlich, Frankfurt 1974, ISBN 3-8035-0474-0\nLeipzig und das Leipziger Land, Weidlich, Frankfurt 1976, ISBN 3-8035-8511-2\nDie Albertinischen Wettiner \u2014 Geschichte des S\u00e4chsischen K\u00f6nigshauses (1763\u20131932), 1st ed., St.-Otto-Verlag, Bamberg, 1989, ISBN 3-87693-211-4; 2d ed., Gr\u00e4felfing, 1992, ISBN 3-87014-020-8\nWeihnacht in Sachsen, Bayerische Verlagsanstalt, Munich, 1992, ISBN 3-87052-799-4\nDie Wettiner in Lebensbildern, Styria-Verlag, Vienna, Graz and Cologne, 1995, ISBN 3-222-12301-2\nDie Wettiner in Sachsen und Th\u00fcringen, K\u00f6nig-Friedrich-August-Institut, Dresden, 1996\nDas Haus Wettin und die Beziehungen zum Haus Nassau-Luxemburg, Bad Ems, 2003\nBayern & Sachsen \u2014 gemeinsame Geschichte, Kunst, Kultur und Wirtschaft (with Elmira of Saxony and Walter Beck), Universitas, Munich, 2004, ISBN 3-8004-1462-7\nK\u00f6nigreich Sachsen: 1806\u20131918; Traditionen in Schwarz und Gelb, Verlagsgesellschaft Marienberg, 2007, ISBN 978-3-931770-67-9\nPassage 10:\nAgnes of Meissen\nAgnes of Meissen (born before 1264 \u2013 died after September 1332) was a noblewoman, the daughter of Albert II, Margrave of Meissen and his wife Margaret of Sicily.Agnes was married with Henry I \"the Marvelous\" of Brunswick-Grubenhagen, in 1282.

She was regent of Meissen during the minority of her son, Ekbert II.\n\nLife\nImmilla was the daughter of Ulric Manfred II of Turin and Bertha of Milan and thereby a member of the Arduinici dynasty. Her older sister was Adelaide of Susa.\nHer first husband was Otto III, Duke of Swabia, whom she married c. 1036. After Otto's death in September 1057, Immilla married again (c.1058). Her second husband was Ekbert I of Meissen.In 1067, shortly before his death, Ekbert I attempted to repudiate Immilla in order to marry Adela of Louvain, daughter of Lambert II, Count of Louvain and the widow of Otto I, Margrave of Meissen. After Ekbert's death in 1068, Immilla spent some time at the imperial court with her niece Bertha, before returning to Italy. It is possible that she acted as regent for her young son, Ekbert II, at this time.Immilla died in Turin in January 10, 1078. She is sometimes said to have become a nun before her death.\n\nMarriages and children\nWith her first husband, Otto, Immilla had five daughters:\n\nBertha (or Alberada) (died 1 April 1103), married firstly Herman II, Count of Kastl, and married secondly Frederick, Count of Kastl\nGisela, inherited Kulmbach and Plassenburg, married Arnold IV, Count of Andechs\nJudith (died 1104), married firstly Conrad I, Duke of Bavaria, and secondly Botho, Count of Pottenstein\nEilika, abbess of Niederm\u00fcnster\nBeatrice (1040\u20131140), inherited Schweinfurt, married Henry II, Count of Hildrizhausen and Margrave of the NordgauWith her second husband, Ekbert I, Immilla had the following children:\n\nEkbert II\nGertrude\nPassage 2:\nVolkold\nVolkold of Meissen (also Wolcold, Folcold, Folchold, Volhold, Volkhuld, Volchrad, Vocco; died 23 August 992) was the second Bishop of Meissen.\n\nLife\nBefore his elevation to the episcopate all that is known of Volkold's life is that he was at the court of Emperor Otto I as one of the tutors of the Emperor's son, the  future Otto II. He seems to have been appointed Bishop of Meissen in 969. Before his elevation Volkold was the patron of the young Willigis, later Saint Willigis, and used his influence to obtain for him a position in the Imperial service. In 972 Volkold attended a synod in Ingelheim.When Boleslaus II, Duke of Bohemia, besieged the Albrechtsburg and the town of Meissen in 984 in support of the Imperial ambitions of Henry II of Bavaria after the death of Otto II, Volkold was obliged to seek refuge from the Sorbs in Erfurt, under the protection of Willigis, and was not able to return to his badly-damaged headquarters until after the re-conquest by Ekkehard I, Margrave of Meissen, in 987. In that year he put the diocese under Imperial protection.Doubtless as compensation for the bishopric's many losses he received from Otto II several gifts of estates, tolls and uses.While on a visit to Prague he suffered a stroke, on Good Friday 992, and returned paralysed to Meissen, where he died on 23 August and was buried.\nPassage 3:\nAlbrecht I of Meissen\nAlbrecht I of Meissen (died 1 August 1152) was Bishop of Meissen from 1150 to 1152.\n\nLife\nAlbrecht I is not extensively documented. He was supposedly from a family of the Sorbian nobility. Before his elevation to the bishopric he was a cathedral provost. Otto von Freising mentions Albrecht in 1151 in connection with the dispute between Friedrich II of Berg and Herman van Horne over the office of bishop of Utrecht.\nWith the agreement of the Pope, the bishopric of Meissen, like that of Naumburg, was under the protection of Burggraf Conrad I of Meissen, in return for which the bishops were expected to undertake appropriate tasks from time to time. At the beginning of 1152 Conrad III entrusted Albrecht, who had the reputation of being talented at languages, with a diplomatic mission to the Byzantine Emperor Manuel I Komnenos. The bishop died either on the way to Constantinople or in the city itself.\nPassage 4:\nJohn I, Duke of Brunswick-Grubenhagen\nJohn I, Duke of Brunswick-Grubenhagen (born: before 1322; died: 23 May 1367) was provost of the St. Alexandri Minster in Einbeck.\nHe was the son of Duke Henry I \"the Marvelous\" of Brunswick-Grubenhagen and his wife Agnes of Meissen, daughter of Margrave Albert II of Meissen.\nPassage 5:\nAgnes of Waiblingen\nAgnes of Waiblingen (1072/73 \u2013 24 September 1143), also known as Agnes of Germany, Agnes of Poitou and Agnes of Saarbr\u00fccken, was a member of the Salian imperial family.

The fourth child and youngest son of Friedrich Christian, Margrave of Meissen and his wife Princess Elisabeth Helene of Thurn and Taxis, he was the younger brother of Maria Emanuel, Margrave of Meissen, who was his predecessor as head of the Royal House of Saxony. Had he been King he would have been known as Albert II\n\nLife\nAlbert received his secondary education at the Federal Gymnasium in Bregenz, Austria. He passed his matura in 1954.  His parents and their children then moved to Munich, with support from his mother's relatives from the Thurn und Taxis dynasty.  In Munich, Albert studied at the Ludwig Maximilian University. He initially studied macroeconomics, and later switched to history and ethnography.  On 13 February 1961, he received his PhD for a thesis on his great-great-grandfather, King John of Saxony, and his reform of Saxon commercial law.\nOn 30 January 1960 the Studiengruppe f\u00fcr S\u00e4chsische Geschichte und Kultur e.V. (\"Study group for Saxon history and culture\") was founded by Albert together with his parents, his elder brother Maria Emanuel, some other Saxon nobles, the Chapter of the Military Order of St. Henry, the chapter of the association of people from Dresden, and the association of Heimatvertriebene in the history department of the University of Munich. This study group became one of the largest historical societies in West Germany. After completing his studies, Albert worked as a historian and referent. He studied the history of the Duchy of Saxony and the Kingdom of Saxony, in particular the relationship of Saxony to Bavaria.\nAt times, he was vice president of the Bund der Mitteldeutschen (\"Association of Central Germans\").  In 1972, he joined the Mitteldeutschen Kulturrat e.V. (\"Central German Culture Council\"), where he represented the interests of the Free State of Saxony.\nIn the summer of 1982, he was allowed to visit Saxony for the first time since his youth. He visited again in 1983 and 1985. He was then not allowed to enter the German Democratic Republic again, for unknown reasons, until 1989/1990. On 22 January 1990, he participated in a Monday demonstration in Dresden and was unexpectedly asked to address the crowd. He told his audience about their task to rebuild Saxony and ended with the words \"Long live Saxony, Germany, Europe and the western-Christian culture.\"\nIn the subsequent elections for the Saxon parliament, he ran as a DSU candidate; he was not elected, nor did the newly elected government of Saxony employ him as an advisor. After the German reunification, he has tried to reclaim some of his family's former possessions.\n\nMarriage\nAlbert morganatically wed Elmira Henke in a civil ceremony on 10 April 1980 in Munich, and in a religious ceremony on 12 April 1980, in the Theatine Church, also in Munich. Elmira assisted Albert with his scientific and historical studies; she specialized in ethnographic topics. Albert and Elmira had no children.\n\nSuccession\nThe headship of the Royal House of Saxony is a matter of dispute in the Saxon Royal Family. The conflict stems from the fact that the last undisputed head of the house Maria Emanuel, Margrave of Meissen, and the other princes of his generation either had no children or, in the case of Prince Timo, had children (including Prince R\u00fcdiger of Saxony) who were deemed not to be members of the Royal House of Saxony.The first designated dynastic heir of Maria Emanuel was his and Albert's nephew Prince Johannes of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, only son of their youngest sister Princess Mathilde of Saxony by her marriage to Prince Johannes Heinrich of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, dynast of a ducal branch of the House of Wettin senior patrilineally to the royal branch. After the early death of Prince Johannes, the heirless Maria Emanuel then considered as potential heir another nephew, Alexander Afif, the eldest son of Princess Anna of Saxony and her husband Roberto Afif, despite the Afif-Saxony marriage being contrary to the traditional laws of the House of Saxony which required equal marriages for descendants to inherit dynastic rights. On 14 May 1997 the Margrave of Meissen proposed his nephew Alexander Afif as heir and drew up a document that was signed by the other male and female members of the Royal House (including previously non-dynastic spouses of princes) setting out that Alexander would succeed on his death. The document was signed by: Anastasia, Margravine of Meissen, Prince Albert and his wife, n\u00e9e Elmira Henke, Prince Dedo (for himself, for his brother Prince Gero and for their stepmother n\u00e9e Virginia Dulon \u2013 his brother Prince Timo had died in 1982), the Princesses Maria Josepha, Anna and Mathilde, and Prince Timo's third wife, n\u00e9e Erina Eilts. Two years later on 1 July 1999 the Margrave adopted his nephew Alexander Afif, who had used the title Alexander, Prince of Saxe-Gessaphe since 1972, based on his patrilineal descent from the once-sovereign Lebanese \"Afif\" (or Gessaphe) dynasty.The 1997 agreement proved to be controversial and in the summer of 2002 three of the signatories, Princes Albert, Dedo and Gero (the latter consented via proxy but had not personally signed the document) retracted their support for the agreement. The following year Prince Albert wrote that it is through Prince R\u00fcdiger and his sons that the direct line of the Albertine branch of the House of Wettin will continue, and thus avoid becoming extinct. Until his death, however, the Margrave, as head of the former dynasty, continued to regard his nephew and adopted son, Prince Alexander, as the contractual heir entitled to succeed.Immediately following the death of Maria Emanuel in July 2012, Prince Albert assumed the position of head of the Royal House of Saxony. According to the Eurohistory Journal prior to the Margrave's funeral Albert met with his nephew, Alexander, and recognised him as Margrave of Meissen. However this claim is contradicted by Albert himself in his final interview, given after the funeral, where he states that he needs recognition as Margrave of Meissen. Prince Alexander, citing the 1997 agreement, has also assumed the headship. Albert, Margrave of Meissen died at a hospital in Munich on 6 October 2012 at the age of 77.\nPrior to the requiem for Margrave Maria Emanuel, R\u00fcdiger, who had sought to be recognised by his cousin as a dynastic member of the House of Saxony but was refused, conducted a demonstration outside the cathedral with Saxon royalists in protest against the late Margrave Maria Emanuel's decision to appoint Alexander as heir. \nThe family website of Prince R\u00fcdiger states that, prior to his death, Albert determined R\u00fcdiger to be his successor and instituted a clear succession plan. On this basis following Albert's death Prince R\u00fcdiger assumed the headship of the house.\n\nAncestry\nPublications by Prince Albert\nDie Reform der s\u00e4chsischen Gewerbegesetzgebung (1840\u20131861), PhD thesis, University of Munich, 1970\nDresden, Weidlich, Frankfurt 1974, ISBN 3-8035-0474-0\nLeipzig und das Leipziger Land, Weidlich, Frankfurt 1976, ISBN 3-8035-8511-2\nDie Albertinischen Wettiner \u2014 Geschichte des S\u00e4chsischen K\u00f6nigshauses (1763\u20131932), 1st ed., St.-Otto-Verlag, Bamberg, 1989, ISBN 3-87693-211-4; 2d ed., Gr\u00e4felfing, 1992, ISBN 3-87014-020-8\nWeihnacht in Sachsen, Bayerische Verlagsanstalt, Munich, 1992, ISBN 3-87052-799-4\nDie Wettiner in Lebensbildern, Styria-Verlag, Vienna, Graz and Cologne, 1995, ISBN 3-222-12301-2\nDie Wettiner in Sachsen und Th\u00fcringen, K\u00f6nig-Friedrich-August-Institut, Dresden, 1996\nDas Haus Wettin und die Beziehungen zum Haus Nassau-Luxemburg, Bad Ems, 2003\nBayern & Sachsen \u2014 gemeinsame Geschichte, Kunst, Kultur und Wirtschaft (with Elmira of Saxony and Walter Beck), Universitas, Munich, 2004, ISBN 3-8004-1462-7\nK\u00f6nigreich Sachsen: 1806\u20131918; Traditionen in Schwarz und Gelb, Verlagsgesellschaft Marienberg, 2007, ISBN 978-3-931770-67-9\nPassage 10:\nAgnes of Meissen\nAgnes of Meissen (born before 1264 \u2013 died after September 1332) was a noblewoman, the daughter of Albert II, Margrave of Meissen and his wife Margaret of Sicily.Agnes was married with Henry I \"the Marvelous\" of Brunswick-Grubenhagen, in 1282.

Prior to his current position, Govan worked as the director of the Dia Art Foundation in New York City.\n\nEarly life and education\nGovan was born in 1963 in North Adams, Massachusetts, and was raised in the Washington D.C. area, attending Sidwell Friends School.He majored in art history and fine arts at Williams College, where he met Thomas Krens, who was then director of the Williams College Museum of Art. Govan became closely involved with the museum, serving as acting curator as an undergraduate. After receiving his B.A. from Williams in 1985, Govan began an MFA in fine arts from the University of California, San Diego.\n\nCareer\nAs a twenty-five year old graduate student, Govan was recruited by his former mentor at Williams, Thomas Krens, who in 1988 had been appointed director of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation. Govan served as deputy director of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum under Krens from 1988 to 1994, a period that culminated in the construction and opening of the Frank Gehry designed Guggenheim branch in Bilbao, Spain. Govan supervised the reinstallation of the museum's permanent collection galleries after its extensive renovation.\n\nDia Art Foundation\nFrom 1994 to 2006, Govan was president and director of Dia Art Foundation in New York City. There, he spearheaded the conversion of a Nabisco box factory into the 300,000 square foot Dia:Beacon in New York's Hudson Valley, which houses Dia's collection of art from the 1960s to the present. Built in a former Nabisco box factory, the critically acclaimed museum has been credited with catalyzing a cultural and economic revival within the formerly factory-based city of Beacon. Dia's collection nearly doubled in size during Govan's tenure, but he also came under criticism for \"needlessly and permanently\" closing Dia's West 22nd Street building. During his time at Dia, Govan also worked closely with artists James Turrell and Michael Heizer, becoming an ardent supporter of Roden Crater and City, the artists' respective site-specific land art projects under construction in the American southwest. Govan successfully lobbied Washington to have the 704,000 acres in central Nevada surrounding City declared a national monument in 2015.\n\nLACMA\nIn February 2006, a search committee composed of eleven LACMA trustees, led by the late Nancy M. Daly, recruited Govan to run the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. Govan has stated that he was drawn to the role not only because of LACMA's geographical distance from its European and east coast peers, but also because of the museum's relative youth, having been established in 1961. \"I felt that because of this newness I had the opportunity to reconsider the museum,\" Govan has written, \"[and] Los Angeles is a good place to do that.\"Govan has been widely regarded for transforming LACMA into both a local and international landmark. Since Govan's arrival, LACMA has acquired by donation or purchase over 27,000 works for the permanent collection, and the museum's gallery space has almost doubled thanks to the addition of two new buildings designed by Renzo Piano, the Broad Contemporary Art Museum (BCAM) and the Lynda and Stewart Resnick Pavilion. LACMA's annual attendance has grown from 600,000 to nearly 1.6 million in 2016.\n\nArtist collaborations\nSince his arrival, Govan has commissioned exhibition scenography and gallery designs in collaboration with artists. In 2006, for example, Govan invited LA artist John Baldessari to design an upcoming exhibition about the Belgian surrealist Ren\u00e9 Magritte, resulting in a theatrical show that reflected the twisted perspective of the latter's topsy-turvy world. Baldessari has also designed LACMA's logo. Since then, Govan has also commissioned Cuban-American artist Jorge Pardo to design LACMA's Art of the Ancient Americas gallery, described in the Los Angeles Times as a \"gritty cavern deep inside the earth ... crossed with a high-style urban lounge.\"Govan has also commissioned several large-scale public artworks for LACMA's campus from contemporary California artists. These include Chris Burden's Urban Light (2008), a series of 202 vintage street lamps from different neighborhoods in Los Angeles, arranged in front of the entrance pavilion, Barbara Kruger's Untitled (Shafted) (2008), Robert Irwin's Primal Palm Garden (2010), and Michael Heizer's Levitated Mass, a 340-ton boulder transported 100 miles from the Jurupa Valley to LACMA, a widely publicized journey that culminated with a large celebration on Wilshire Boulevard. Thanks in part to the popularity of these public artworks, LACMA was ranked the fourth most instagrammed museum in the world in 2016.In his first three full years, the museum raised $251 million\u2014about $100 million more than it collected during the three years before he arrived. In 2010, it was announced that Govan will steer LACMA for at least six more years. In a letter dated February 24, 2013, Govan, along with the LACMA board's co-chairmen Terry Semel and Andrew Gordon, proposed a merger with the financially troubled Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles and a plan to raise $100 million for the combined museum.\n\nZumthor Project\nGovan's latest project is an ambitious building project, the replacement of four of the campus's aging buildings with a single new state of the art gallery building designed by architect Peter Zumthor. As of January 2017, he has raised about $300 million in commitments. Construction is expected to begin in 2018, and the new building will open in 2023, to coincide with the opening of the new D Line metro stop on Wilshire Boulevard. The project also envisages dissolving all existing curatorial departments and departmental collections. Some commentators have been highly critical of Govan's plans. Joseph Giovannini, recalling Govan's technically unrealizable onetime plan to hang Jeff Koons' Train sculpture from the facade of the Ahmanson Gallery, has accused Govan of \"driving the institution over a cliff into an equivalent mid-air wreck of its own\". Describing the collection merging proposal as the creation of a \"giant raffle bowl of some 130,000 objects\", Giovannini also points out that the Zumthor building will contain 33% less gallery space than the galleries it will replace, and that the linear footage of wall space available for displays will decrease by about 7,500 ft, or 1.5 miles. Faced with losing a building named in its honor, and anticipating that its acquisitions could no longer be displayed, the Ahmanson Foundation withdrew its support.\nOn the merging of the separate curatorial divisions to create a non-departmental art museum, Christopher Knight has pointed out that \"no other museum of LACMA's size and complexity does it\" that way, and characterized the museum's 2019 \"To Rome and Back\" exhibition, the first to take place under the new scheme, as \"bland and ineffectual\" and an \"unsuccessful sample of what's to come\".\n\nPersonal life\nGovan is married and has two daughters, one from a previous marriage. He and his family used to live in a $6 million mansion in Hancock Park that was provided by LACMA - a benefit worth $155,000 a year, according to most recent tax filings - until LACMA decided that it would sell the property to make up for the museum's of almost $900 million in debt [2]. That home is now worth nearly $8 million and Govan now lives in a trailer park in Malibu's Point Dume region.\nLos Angeles CA 90020\nUnited States. He has had a private pilot's license since 1995 and keeps a 1979 Beechcraft Bonanza at Santa Monica Airport.\nPassage 5:\nEtan Boritzer\nEtan Boritzer (born 1950) is an American writer of children\u2019s literature who is best known for his book What is God? first published in 1989. His best selling What is? illustrated children's book series on character education and difficult subjects for children is a popular teaching guide for parents, teachers and child-life professionals.Boritzer gained national critical acclaim after What is God? was published in 1989 although the book has caused controversy from religious fundamentalists for its universalist views.

The series is now also translated into 15 languages.\nBoritzer was first published in 1963 at the age of 13 when he wrote an essay in his English class at Wade Junior High School in the Bronx, New York on the assassination of John F. Kennedy. His essay was included in a special anthology by New York City public school children compiled and published by the New York City Department of Education.\nBoritzer now lives in Venice, California and maintains his publishing office there also. He has helped numerous other authors to get published through How to Get Your Book Published! programs. Boritzer is also a yoga teacher who teaches regular classes locally and guest-teaches nationally. He is also recognized nationally as an erudite speaker on The Teachings of the Buddha.\nPassage 6:\nTanikella Bharani\nTanikella Bharani (born 14 July 1954) is an Indian actor, screenwriter, poet, playwright and director who works predominantly in Telugu cinema.

Prior to his current position, Govan worked as the director of the Dia Art Foundation in New York City.\n\nEarly life and education\nGovan was born in 1963 in North Adams, Massachusetts, and was raised in the Washington D.C. area, attending Sidwell Friends School.He majored in art history and fine arts at Williams College, where he met Thomas Krens, who was then director of the Williams College Museum of Art. Govan became closely involved with the museum, serving as acting curator as an undergraduate. After receiving his B.A. from Williams in 1985, Govan began an MFA in fine arts from the University of California, San Diego.\n\nCareer\nAs a twenty-five year old graduate student, Govan was recruited by his former mentor at Williams, Thomas Krens, who in 1988 had been appointed director of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation. Govan served as deputy director of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum under Krens from 1988 to 1994, a period that culminated in the construction and opening of the Frank Gehry designed Guggenheim branch in Bilbao, Spain. Govan supervised the reinstallation of the museum's permanent collection galleries after its extensive renovation.\n\nDia Art Foundation\nFrom 1994 to 2006, Govan was president and director of Dia Art Foundation in New York City. There, he spearheaded the conversion of a Nabisco box factory into the 300,000 square foot Dia:Beacon in New York's Hudson Valley, which houses Dia's collection of art from the 1960s to the present. Built in a former Nabisco box factory, the critically acclaimed museum has been credited with catalyzing a cultural and economic revival within the formerly factory-based city of Beacon. Dia's collection nearly doubled in size during Govan's tenure, but he also came under criticism for \"needlessly and permanently\" closing Dia's West 22nd Street building. During his time at Dia, Govan also worked closely with artists James Turrell and Michael Heizer, becoming an ardent supporter of Roden Crater and City, the artists' respective site-specific land art projects under construction in the American southwest. Govan successfully lobbied Washington to have the 704,000 acres in central Nevada surrounding City declared a national monument in 2015.\n\nLACMA\nIn February 2006, a search committee composed of eleven LACMA trustees, led by the late Nancy M. Daly, recruited Govan to run the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. Govan has stated that he was drawn to the role not only because of LACMA's geographical distance from its European and east coast peers, but also because of the museum's relative youth, having been established in 1961. \"I felt that because of this newness I had the opportunity to reconsider the museum,\" Govan has written, \"[and] Los Angeles is a good place to do that.\"Govan has been widely regarded for transforming LACMA into both a local and international landmark. Since Govan's arrival, LACMA has acquired by donation or purchase over 27,000 works for the permanent collection, and the museum's gallery space has almost doubled thanks to the addition of two new buildings designed by Renzo Piano, the Broad Contemporary Art Museum (BCAM) and the Lynda and Stewart Resnick Pavilion. LACMA's annual attendance has grown from 600,000 to nearly 1.6 million in 2016.\n\nArtist collaborations\nSince his arrival, Govan has commissioned exhibition scenography and gallery designs in collaboration with artists. In 2006, for example, Govan invited LA artist John Baldessari to design an upcoming exhibition about the Belgian surrealist Ren\u00e9 Magritte, resulting in a theatrical show that reflected the twisted perspective of the latter's topsy-turvy world. Baldessari has also designed LACMA's logo. Since then, Govan has also commissioned Cuban-American artist Jorge Pardo to design LACMA's Art of the Ancient Americas gallery, described in the Los Angeles Times as a \"gritty cavern deep inside the earth ... crossed with a high-style urban lounge.\"Govan has also commissioned several large-scale public artworks for LACMA's campus from contemporary California artists. These include Chris Burden's Urban Light (2008), a series of 202 vintage street lamps from different neighborhoods in Los Angeles, arranged in front of the entrance pavilion, Barbara Kruger's Untitled (Shafted) (2008), Robert Irwin's Primal Palm Garden (2010), and Michael Heizer's Levitated Mass, a 340-ton boulder transported 100 miles from the Jurupa Valley to LACMA, a widely publicized journey that culminated with a large celebration on Wilshire Boulevard. Thanks in part to the popularity of these public artworks, LACMA was ranked the fourth most instagrammed museum in the world in 2016.In his first three full years, the museum raised $251 million\u2014about $100 million more than it collected during the three years before he arrived. In 2010, it was announced that Govan will steer LACMA for at least six more years. In a letter dated February 24, 2013, Govan, along with the LACMA board's co-chairmen Terry Semel and Andrew Gordon, proposed a merger with the financially troubled Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles and a plan to raise $100 million for the combined museum.\n\nZumthor Project\nGovan's latest project is an ambitious building project, the replacement of four of the campus's aging buildings with a single new state of the art gallery building designed by architect Peter Zumthor. As of January 2017, he has raised about $300 million in commitments. Construction is expected to begin in 2018, and the new building will open in 2023, to coincide with the opening of the new D Line metro stop on Wilshire Boulevard. The project also envisages dissolving all existing curatorial departments and departmental collections. Some commentators have been highly critical of Govan's plans. Joseph Giovannini, recalling Govan's technically unrealizable onetime plan to hang Jeff Koons' Train sculpture from the facade of the Ahmanson Gallery, has accused Govan of \"driving the institution over a cliff into an equivalent mid-air wreck of its own\". Describing the collection merging proposal as the creation of a \"giant raffle bowl of some 130,000 objects\", Giovannini also points out that the Zumthor building will contain 33% less gallery space than the galleries it will replace, and that the linear footage of wall space available for displays will decrease by about 7,500 ft, or 1.5 miles. Faced with losing a building named in its honor, and anticipating that its acquisitions could no longer be displayed, the Ahmanson Foundation withdrew its support.\nOn the merging of the separate curatorial divisions to create a non-departmental art museum, Christopher Knight has pointed out that \"no other museum of LACMA's size and complexity does it\" that way, and characterized the museum's 2019 \"To Rome and Back\" exhibition, the first to take place under the new scheme, as \"bland and ineffectual\" and an \"unsuccessful sample of what's to come\".\n\nPersonal life\nGovan is married and has two daughters, one from a previous marriage. He and his family used to live in a $6 million mansion in Hancock Park that was provided by LACMA - a benefit worth $155,000 a year, according to most recent tax filings - until LACMA decided that it would sell the property to make up for the museum's of almost $900 million in debt [2]. That home is now worth nearly $8 million and Govan now lives in a trailer park in Malibu's Point Dume region.\nLos Angeles CA 90020\nUnited States. He has had a private pilot's license since 1995 and keeps a 1979 Beechcraft Bonanza at Santa Monica Airport.\nPassage 5:\nEtan Boritzer\nEtan Boritzer (born 1950) is an American writer of children\u2019s literature who is best known for his book What is God? first published in 1989. His best selling What is? illustrated children's book series on character education and difficult subjects for children is a popular teaching guide for parents, teachers and child-life professionals.Boritzer gained national critical acclaim after What is God? was published in 1989 although the book has caused controversy from religious fundamentalists for its universalist views.

He graduated from Poly Prep Country Day School and Franklin and Marshall College (A.B. 1965) and American University (M.A. 1966). He received an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from Franklin and Marshall in 1989. While in college he was a member of Zeta Beta Tau.\n\nPolitical career\nDuberstein began his public service on Capitol Hill as an intern for Sen. Jacob K. Javits. His other early government service included Deputy Under Secretary of Labor during the Gerald Ford Administration and Director of Congressional and Intergovernmental Affairs at the U.S. General Services Administration.During Reagan's eight years in office, he had two stints in the White House. His first was as  Deputy Assistant to the President for Legislative Affairs (1981\u201383). His major accomplishment of this period was pushing Reagan's economic agenda through a Democratic House, including the  1982 Tax Bill. Duberstein was described as Reagan's invisible link to Congress. He was at the center of the Administrations push for the bill, working on both sides of the political divide.   His second stint was also for two years, first as Deputy Chief of Staff and then for the final six months of the Reagan presidency as White House Chief of Staff (1988\u20131989). Eight days after Reagan was on TV and acknowledged the Iran-Contra affair, Duberstein took over as chief of staff. Around that time it had been revealed that Nancy Reagan had used an astrologer to determine dates for the president's public appearances. Reagan's presidency had reached a low point; approval rating was at 37%. His promotion was called a wake-up call for a \"drowsy White House.\" He came to the job with energy, loyalty, hard work and enthusiasm, having earned the nickname Duderdog; and, he made sure to call Nancy twice a day. He had Reagan give a mea culpa address to the nation; poll numbers went right up and the presidency had been turned around.Duberstein is said to have been the first Jewish person to be White House Chief of Staff.Between his White House appointments, he was vice-president and director of Business-Government Relations of the Committee for Economic Development and was a lobbyist as vice president of Timmons & Company. Prior to 1987, he served on the Commission for the Preservation of America's Heritage Abroad, succeeded by Betty Heitman, previously co-chairwoman of the Republican National Committee.\n\nLater career\nIn January 1989, Duberstein was awarded the President's Citizens Medal by President Reagan. He was the chairman of the Ethics Committee for the U.S. Olympic Committee  and served as vice chairman of the independent Special Bid Oversight Reform Commission for the U.S. Olympics Committee. He also appeared on Bloomberg alongside John Podesta, and had 23 appearances on C-SPAN. Beginning in season five Duberstein was a consultant for the tv show The West Wing.In 2013, Duberstein was a signatory to an amicus curiae brief submitted to the United States Supreme Court in support of same-sex marriage in the Hollingsworth v. Perry case. His position succeeded, as the court would go on to effectively legalize same-sex marriage in California.\n\nLobbyist\nDuberstein transitioned from the White House to lobbyist; he was successful, and his insight and advice was sought by leaders of both parties. Duberstein founded The Duberstein Group Inc. in 1987. It is a consulting services company providing corporate consulting and government relations services. Among its client are Amazon, BP and MLB. Duberstein was hired by Russian authorities, via Goldman Sachs, to lobby against the Magnitsky Bill (as known as the Sergei Magnitsky Rule of Law Accountability Act), a bill in the U.S. Congress \"to impose sanctions on persons responsible for the detention, abuse, or death of Sergei Magnitsky, and for other gross violations of human rights in the Russian Federation\". Duberstein showed discretion and did not discuss his work, leading to an \"air of mystery\" about him and what he did for his clients.\n\nEducation activities\nIn 2020, he established the Public Service Internship Endowment at his alma mater, Franklin and Marshall, assisting F&M students who secure unpaid internships in public service in Washington, D.C. He was on the college's Board of Trustees from 1994 to 2010, and then became an emeritus trustee. A space at the Franklin and Marshall Patricia E. Harris Center for Business, Government and Public Policy is named for him, the \"Duberstein West Wing\". He spoke at the dedication of the center and led fund raising for the building's renovations. At Harvard Kennedy School, he chaired a senior advisory committee and was a \u201cconstant and inspiring presence\u201d to students.\n\nPolitical adviser\nHe was an adviser to former Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage, according to syndicated columnist Robert Novak, who said that Duberstein was a source for David Corn's and Michael Isikoff's book about the Valerie Plame affair in which Armitage was found to be the one who leaked Plame's CIA status to Novak.Duberstein and Colin Powell became close during his time as chief of staff and Powell's position as National Security Advisor in the Reagan White House.  When Powell considered a 1996 presidential run, he was advised by Duberstein. Duberstein guided him to \"play the press\" and win over Republican leaders.  Powell ended up not making the run.  When Powell's reputation was damaged by his role in the 2003 Iraq War, he used Duberstein to act as a consigliere to repair his name.Duberstein guided Supreme Court Justices David Souter and Clarence Thomas through their ritualistic confirmation proceedings. Other high level appointees he advised and guided through confirmation hearings included CIA Director Robert M. Gates and Secretary of State George P. Shultz. His business partner, Michael S. Berman, a Democrat, performed similar tasks for Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer.\n\nBoards\nDuberstein enjoyed lucrative posts on countless boards of directors, including The Boeing Company, ConocoPhillips, the Fleming Companies, Inc., and The St. Paul Companies, Inc. He was also on the Board of Governors for the American Stock Exchange and NASD, and served on the Board of Directors of Fannie Mae. He served on the advisory board for Washington, DC-based non-profit America Abroad Media.\n\nPersonality\nDuberstein, a \"back-slapping Brooklyn native,\" was one of the most connected Washington people. \"A permanent Washington fixture,\" he was a regular at Washington parties and network talk shows.  A gregarious and rumpled, wise-cracking \u2018people person\u2019 of relentless optimism and energy...the consummate Washington insider and institutionalist, a big man with an easy smile and a generous laugh who could be hard-nosed, loved gossiping with reporters, believed in bipartisanship and offered his advice to anyone who asked \u2014 especially those who succeeded him in the chief of staff job. Duberstein noted that as a Brooklynite he always enjoyed working with people. As a \"cultivator\" of the press he was generally discreet, refusing to be quoted by name, even for articles about himself. He was forever loved by the Washington press for all the leaking he did during the Reagan years; and, \"he loved being Ken Duberstein.\"\n\nPolitical views\nDuberstein was a political moderate Rockefeller Republican, fiscally conservative and socially moderate.\nBefore McCain secured the 2008 Republican presidential nomination, Duberstein made inquiries about running the transition team; McCain was not interested.  He later broke from his party in the election and supported Obama; commenting on the nomination of Sarah Palin for vice-president, he said: \u201cEven at McDonald's, you\u2019re interviewed three times before you\u2019re given a job.\"\n\nPersonal life, health and death\nDuberstein was married three times, with his first two marriages, to Marjorie Duberstein and Sydney Duberstein, ending in divorce. He had a daughter from the first marriage and three children from the second. He was then married to Jacqueline Fain, a former TV producer, for 18 years until his death. At their 2003 wedding, Supreme Court Justice David Souter was the officiant and Marvin Hamlisch provided the music.  He had a history of kidney disease, and in 2014, received a kidney transplant; his son was the donor. After a long illness, Duberstein died at Sibley Memorial Hospital in Washington on March 2, 2022, at the age of 77. The funeral was at Washington Hebrew Congregation\nPassage 8:\nRobert Huntley\nRobert E. R.

He graduated from Poly Prep Country Day School and Franklin and Marshall College (A.B. 1965) and American University (M.A. 1966). He received an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from Franklin and Marshall in 1989. While in college he was a member of Zeta Beta Tau.\n\nPolitical career\nDuberstein began his public service on Capitol Hill as an intern for Sen. Jacob K. Javits. His other early government service included Deputy Under Secretary of Labor during the Gerald Ford Administration and Director of Congressional and Intergovernmental Affairs at the U.S. General Services Administration.During Reagan's eight years in office, he had two stints in the White House. His first was as  Deputy Assistant to the President for Legislative Affairs (1981\u201383). His major accomplishment of this period was pushing Reagan's economic agenda through a Democratic House, including the  1982 Tax Bill. Duberstein was described as Reagan's invisible link to Congress. He was at the center of the Administrations push for the bill, working on both sides of the political divide.   His second stint was also for two years, first as Deputy Chief of Staff and then for the final six months of the Reagan presidency as White House Chief of Staff (1988\u20131989). Eight days after Reagan was on TV and acknowledged the Iran-Contra affair, Duberstein took over as chief of staff. Around that time it had been revealed that Nancy Reagan had used an astrologer to determine dates for the president's public appearances. Reagan's presidency had reached a low point; approval rating was at 37%. His promotion was called a wake-up call for a \"drowsy White House.\" He came to the job with energy, loyalty, hard work and enthusiasm, having earned the nickname Duderdog; and, he made sure to call Nancy twice a day. He had Reagan give a mea culpa address to the nation; poll numbers went right up and the presidency had been turned around.Duberstein is said to have been the first Jewish person to be White House Chief of Staff.Between his White House appointments, he was vice-president and director of Business-Government Relations of the Committee for Economic Development and was a lobbyist as vice president of Timmons & Company. Prior to 1987, he served on the Commission for the Preservation of America's Heritage Abroad, succeeded by Betty Heitman, previously co-chairwoman of the Republican National Committee.\n\nLater career\nIn January 1989, Duberstein was awarded the President's Citizens Medal by President Reagan. He was the chairman of the Ethics Committee for the U.S. Olympic Committee  and served as vice chairman of the independent Special Bid Oversight Reform Commission for the U.S. Olympics Committee. He also appeared on Bloomberg alongside John Podesta, and had 23 appearances on C-SPAN. Beginning in season five Duberstein was a consultant for the tv show The West Wing.In 2013, Duberstein was a signatory to an amicus curiae brief submitted to the United States Supreme Court in support of same-sex marriage in the Hollingsworth v. Perry case. His position succeeded, as the court would go on to effectively legalize same-sex marriage in California.\n\nLobbyist\nDuberstein transitioned from the White House to lobbyist; he was successful, and his insight and advice was sought by leaders of both parties. Duberstein founded The Duberstein Group Inc. in 1987. It is a consulting services company providing corporate consulting and government relations services. Among its client are Amazon, BP and MLB. Duberstein was hired by Russian authorities, via Goldman Sachs, to lobby against the Magnitsky Bill (as known as the Sergei Magnitsky Rule of Law Accountability Act), a bill in the U.S. Congress \"to impose sanctions on persons responsible for the detention, abuse, or death of Sergei Magnitsky, and for other gross violations of human rights in the Russian Federation\". Duberstein showed discretion and did not discuss his work, leading to an \"air of mystery\" about him and what he did for his clients.\n\nEducation activities\nIn 2020, he established the Public Service Internship Endowment at his alma mater, Franklin and Marshall, assisting F&M students who secure unpaid internships in public service in Washington, D.C. He was on the college's Board of Trustees from 1994 to 2010, and then became an emeritus trustee. A space at the Franklin and Marshall Patricia E. Harris Center for Business, Government and Public Policy is named for him, the \"Duberstein West Wing\". He spoke at the dedication of the center and led fund raising for the building's renovations. At Harvard Kennedy School, he chaired a senior advisory committee and was a \u201cconstant and inspiring presence\u201d to students.\n\nPolitical adviser\nHe was an adviser to former Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage, according to syndicated columnist Robert Novak, who said that Duberstein was a source for David Corn's and Michael Isikoff's book about the Valerie Plame affair in which Armitage was found to be the one who leaked Plame's CIA status to Novak.Duberstein and Colin Powell became close during his time as chief of staff and Powell's position as National Security Advisor in the Reagan White House.  When Powell considered a 1996 presidential run, he was advised by Duberstein. Duberstein guided him to \"play the press\" and win over Republican leaders.  Powell ended up not making the run.  When Powell's reputation was damaged by his role in the 2003 Iraq War, he used Duberstein to act as a consigliere to repair his name.Duberstein guided Supreme Court Justices David Souter and Clarence Thomas through their ritualistic confirmation proceedings. Other high level appointees he advised and guided through confirmation hearings included CIA Director Robert M. Gates and Secretary of State George P. Shultz. His business partner, Michael S. Berman, a Democrat, performed similar tasks for Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer.\n\nBoards\nDuberstein enjoyed lucrative posts on countless boards of directors, including The Boeing Company, ConocoPhillips, the Fleming Companies, Inc., and The St. Paul Companies, Inc. He was also on the Board of Governors for the American Stock Exchange and NASD, and served on the Board of Directors of Fannie Mae. He served on the advisory board for Washington, DC-based non-profit America Abroad Media.\n\nPersonality\nDuberstein, a \"back-slapping Brooklyn native,\" was one of the most connected Washington people. \"A permanent Washington fixture,\" he was a regular at Washington parties and network talk shows.  A gregarious and rumpled, wise-cracking \u2018people person\u2019 of relentless optimism and energy...the consummate Washington insider and institutionalist, a big man with an easy smile and a generous laugh who could be hard-nosed, loved gossiping with reporters, believed in bipartisanship and offered his advice to anyone who asked \u2014 especially those who succeeded him in the chief of staff job. Duberstein noted that as a Brooklynite he always enjoyed working with people. As a \"cultivator\" of the press he was generally discreet, refusing to be quoted by name, even for articles about himself. He was forever loved by the Washington press for all the leaking he did during the Reagan years; and, \"he loved being Ken Duberstein.\"\n\nPolitical views\nDuberstein was a political moderate Rockefeller Republican, fiscally conservative and socially moderate.\nBefore McCain secured the 2008 Republican presidential nomination, Duberstein made inquiries about running the transition team; McCain was not interested.  He later broke from his party in the election and supported Obama; commenting on the nomination of Sarah Palin for vice-president, he said: \u201cEven at McDonald's, you\u2019re interviewed three times before you\u2019re given a job.\"\n\nPersonal life, health and death\nDuberstein was married three times, with his first two marriages, to Marjorie Duberstein and Sydney Duberstein, ending in divorce. He had a daughter from the first marriage and three children from the second. He was then married to Jacqueline Fain, a former TV producer, for 18 years until his death. At their 2003 wedding, Supreme Court Justice David Souter was the officiant and Marvin Hamlisch provided the music.  He had a history of kidney disease, and in 2014, received a kidney transplant; his son was the donor. After a long illness, Duberstein died at Sibley Memorial Hospital in Washington on March 2, 2022, at the age of 77. The funeral was at Washington Hebrew Congregation\nPassage 8:\nRobert Huntley\nRobert E. R. Huntley (1929 \u2013 December 10, 2015) was an American attorney, businessman, retired law professor, and former president of Washington and Lee University.He graduated from Washington and Lee in 1950 and its law school in 1957. He obtained a master's degree in law from Harvard University in 1962. He joined the law faculty of Washington and Lee in 1958, and served as its dean from 1967 to 1968. In 1968 he was named president of the university, a post he held for 15 years.\nHe practiced law with the Richmond, Virginia law firm of Hunton & Williams from 1988 until his retirement in 1995. He also served as chairman, president and chief executive officer of Best Products. He also served on the board of directors of Altria Group.\n\nRecognition\nWashington and Lee established the endowed Robert E. R.

The name is derived from the location, at the corner of Washington Street and Chapin Street in South Bend. Both museums have one common entrance off Thomas Street, one block south of Washington Street. The museums currently include the History Museum and Studebaker National Museum.\n\nExternal links\nStudebaker National Museum\nThe History Museum\nPassage 2:\nWilliam P. Didusch Center for Urologic History\nThe William P. Didusch Center for Urologic History is a museum and the headquarters of the American Urological Association in Linthicum, Maryland. It is described as encompassing \"a rich and varied collection of drawings, photographs, and instruments of historical importance to urology, many displayed in the urological exhibits during the American Urological Association (AUA) conventions.\"\n\nBackground\nThe center is named in honor of William Didusch, the museum's founder and first curator. Didusch was a notable scientific illustrator, and Executive Secretary of the AUA. Didusch had begun working at Johns Hopkins University in 1915 as an illustrator and eventually a lecturer. Didusch was an artist but more committed to the drawing of illustrations, rather than paintings, of anatomy. As result he became a legend during his time after his work in Johns Hopkins Hospital. Some of his many illustrations were those of the anatomy of the urinary tract and instruments used to treat the urinary diseases. The museum was formally established in 1971 as the William P. Didusch Museum, following Didusch's gift to the American Urological Association of his many original urological drawings. It was accommodated within the headquarters buildings of the AUA, then on Charles Street in Baltimore. Didusch curated the museum until his death in 1981, when he was succeeded by Herbert Brendler. After Brendler's death in 1986, William W. Scott (a colleague of Nobel Laureate Charles Huggins at the University of Chicago) became curator of the museum. When Scott retired in 1993, the post of curator went to Rainer Engel of Johns Hopkins. In 2003 \u2013 when the AUA moved to Linthicum, Maryland \u2013 the museum also moved. Its scope was extended to relate to the topic of research in urologic history. Engel remained curator until 2011, when Michael Moran took over the position.\n\nCollection\n\nThe museum provides 300 years of the history of urology, beginning from early and extremely dangerous kidney stone surgeries to modern ultra sound treatments that \"pulverizes these jagged mineral clumps without any need to enter the body\". It includes illustrations, urological tools such as catheters, cystoscopes (includes Nitze cystoscopes made in 1890 with platinum loops for illumination and rotating cystoscopes), operating resectoscopes, laparoscopes, lithotriptors, and resectoscopes; some of this urologic equipment was sterilized using formaldehyde or cyanide. All was donated by urologists, including Ernest F. Hock of Binghamton, New York, Hans Reuter of Stuttgart, Germany and Adolf A. Kutzmann of Los Angeles.The Center also aids research in all fields of urologic history in the United States. It contains an extensive urological library, with early urological and medical texts, and the AUA archives.Current AUA Historian Engel considers the museum to show how medical history in urology evolved, and notes that the implements on display frequently scare visitors. Amongst its items are \"long, thick metal tubes that once opened the floodgates between some unfortunate soul's bladder and the outside world\", lassoes and nutcrackers on the end of steel tubes to break bladder stones, and Hugh Hampton Young's \"Prostate Punch\", which resembles a \"massively enlarged and curved hypodermic needle designed for the blind resection of prostate tissues\", used in prostate surgery (to ream out the tube of prostate tissue blindly); this last implement was used on the wealthy railway magnate Diamond Jim Brady, who\u2014cured of a prostate problem\u2014gave a generous donation to Johns Hopkins which enabled the establishment of the Brady Urological Institute and also the museum.A number of very large mineral samples of kidney stones are also on display. The collection in the museum also includes more than 30 microscopes dating as far back as the 18th century, along with operating manuals; this acquisition on loan from a German urology family.A popular display is the \"spermatorrhea ring\", a device from the early 20th century used to prevent ejaculations while sleeping. It is made of a double ring of metal, with the inner ring clipped over the penis and the outer ring, which is lined on the inside with an armature of blunt metal teeth, on the shaft. These teeth constitute what could be called the \"medically active ingredient\". In the event of voluntary unknowing erection while sleeping, \"the sensitive skin of the engorged part expands against the spiky outer ring, and the sleeper is pricked into consciousness in time to prevent nature from committing an unspeakable crime against itself\".\nPassage 3:\nLake City-Columbia County Historical Museum\nLake City-Columbia County Historical Museum is a living history museum at the May Vinzant Perkins House in Lake City, Florida.\n\nHistory\nThe Lake City-Columbia County Historical Museum is located in the Vinzant House. The house was built in the 1880s and purchased by John Vinzant Jr. for $450. Vinzant had come to Lake City after serving in the American Civil War as a sergeant in the 1st Florida Cavalry. Vinzant was the Columbia County Clerk of the Circuit Court and County Tax Collector. Vinzant also contributed to the Florida Agricultural College Fund when it was established about 1 mile south from the house in 1888. Vinzant was married to Mattie Vinzant and had three daughters: Cronin Ives, Birdie Livingston and May Perkins. John Vinzant died in 1907. Vinzant's youngest daughter May Perkins was married to Herbert Perkins and moved away to Washington, D.C. In 1912 May Perkins had a son but he died in infancy and then her husband died shortly afterwards. May Perkins returned to her father's house in Lake City. May Perkins' mother Mattied died in 1926 leaving her to live alone at the house until her death in 1981 at 102 years old. Perkins became a notable Lake City poet and historian. Since the death of Perkins in 1981 the house is still called the May Vinzant Perkins house. \nThe Historic Preservation Board of Lake City and Columbia County jointly bought the house with the Blue-Grey Army, Inc. in 1983. The two groups wanted to restore the house and make it a historical and cultural center as well as a museum. The house was renovated in 1984 by the Blue-Grey Army to turn the May Vinzant Perkins house into a museum as well as to save the house from being demolished since it was in poor condition. In 2000 a plaque was placed on the front of the house commemorating May Vinzant Perkins as a notable Floridian.Lake City holds an annual Battle of Olustee festival in downtown. Events are held at the Lake City-Columbia County Museum related to civil war history such as caring for wounded civil war soldiers or performing plays in relation to the civil war. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic the museum had to close from March to the second week of May 2020.\n\nBlue-Grey Army\nThe Blue-Grey Army is an organization that has collected civil war artifacts and annually sponsors the Battle of Olustee Festival in Lake City. The organization jointly bought the Vinzant house with the Lake City Columbia County Historical Society. A room in the museum holds the Blue-Grey Army's civil war artifacts and is called the Blue-Grey Army room.\n\nGallery\nPassage 4:\nHistorical Museum of Serbia\nThe Historical Museum of Serbia (Serbian: \u0418\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0458\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u043c\u0443\u0437\u0435\u0458 \u0421\u0440\u0431\u0438\u0458\u0435/Istorijski muzej Srbije, IMUS) is a public institution dedicated to documentation of history of Serbia from prehistory up to the present.

In 2020, as a part of the Belgrade Waterfront development project, the museum was granted the historical building of the Belgrade Main railway station as its new permanent base. The museum is one of the leading institutions of its kind in the city and the country.\n\nHistory\nThe first unsuccessful initiative to establish the museum was taken in 1950 with the enactment of the Decree on the establishment of the History Museum of the People's Republic of Serbia. The proposal was reinitiated in 1954 with the establishment of the Serbian Revolution Museum (hosted by the Residence of Prince Milo\u0161) commemorating the 150th anniversary of the First Serbian Uprising.The Historical Museum of Serbia was established by the decision of the People's Republic of Serbia authorities on 20 February 1963 with the new institution absorbing the Serbian Revolution Museum. The task of the Museum was defined in 1966 as follows: \u2033to collect, record, store, arrange, study and exhibit material from the history of the Serbian people and Serbia from the earliest times to the present day\u2033.Until 2003 the museum published the  scientific journal Zbornik Istorijskog muzeja Srbije. Initially, from 1954 to 1965, it was published by the Serbian Revolution Museum.In November 2020 the Serbian government made the decision to relocate the museum to a far bigger building, which formerly served as Belgrade Main railway station.\n\nSee also\nList of museums in Serbia\nPassage 5:\nMuseum of the Sea (Uruguay)\nThe Museum of the Sea, opened in 1996, is a museum of natural history located in La Barra, in the department of Maldonado, Uruguay.

In the Museum of the Sea, everything is related to marine life: whale skeletons, seashells, a deep sea room, interactive exhibits, an area where children can draw their own pictures, a section devoted to pirates and another to treasure. The Beach Resort Museum shows the history of holiday resorts, some of which are now city neighbourhoods, such as Pocitos and Carrasco, while others are tourist destinations, such as Punta del Este, La Paloma, Piri\u00e1polis, Atl\u00e1ntida, Mar del Plata and Copacabana. The Nostalgia Museum holds collections of vintage objects such as jars, tins, radio sets, medical remedies, photographs, and beach-related items such as beach umbrellas and pails that were used decades ago. Three collections and 38,000 specimens of insects are exhibited in the Insectarium. Most of the specimens are beetles, but there are also moths, cicadas, and grasshoppers, among other species.\nPassage 6:\nJoliet Area Historical Museum\nThe Joliet Area Historical Museum is a historical museum located in Joliet, Illinois.  The museum documents the history of Joliet and surrounding Will County.\n\nDescription and history\nThe museum adaptively reuses an urban space formerly occupied by the Ottawa Street Methodist Church, which was designed by Joliet architect G. Julian Barnes and built in 1909.  Located on one of the alternate paths of old historic U.S. Route 66, the museum's modern ground-floor addition features the Route 66 Welcome Center, which presents a permanent exhibit called the Route 66 Experience.  This newer part of the museum also connects to the historic Joliet Chamber of Commerce Clubhouse next door (now known as the Renaissance Center of the City Center campus of Joliet Junior College) and to the JJC Renaissance Center's main dining room, which is staffed by the college's hospitality and culinary school students and open to the public.During the late 20th century, formerly rural Will County townships grew rapidly, while properties in central city Joliet were threatened.  In 2002, the former church's urban space was reconfigured as a historic museum.  A separate wing is home to an exhibit about the Joliet-raised NASA engineer and JJC graduate John C. Houbolt, honored as the chief conceptualizer of the lunar orbit rendezvous segment of the U.S. Apollo program and the use of a lunar module to shuttle astronauts to and from the surface of the Moon.The museum is located at 204 N. Ottawa Street in central Joliet.

Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nQuestion: Are both museums, Halifax Historical Museum and William P. Didusch Center For Urologic History, located in the same country?\nAnswer:", "input": "Are both museums, Halifax Historical Museum and William P. Didusch Center For Urologic History, located in the same country?", "context": "Passage 1:\nThe Museums at Washington and Chapin\nThe Museums at Washington and Chapin are several museums that share a campus in South Bend, Indiana. The name is derived from the location, at the corner of Washington Street and Chapin Street in South Bend. Both museums have one common entrance off Thomas Street, one block south of Washington Street. The museums currently include the History Museum and Studebaker National Museum.\n\nExternal links\nStudebaker National Museum\nThe History Museum\nPassage 2:\nWilliam P. Didusch Center for Urologic History\nThe William P. Didusch Center for Urologic History is a museum and the headquarters of the American Urological Association in Linthicum, Maryland. It is described as encompassing \"a rich and varied collection of drawings, photographs, and instruments of historical importance to urology, many displayed in the urological exhibits during the American Urological Association (AUA) conventions.\"\n\nBackground\nThe center is named in honor of William Didusch, the museum's founder and first curator. Didusch was a notable scientific illustrator, and Executive Secretary of the AUA. Didusch had begun working at Johns Hopkins University in 1915 as an illustrator and eventually a lecturer. Didusch was an artist but more committed to the drawing of illustrations, rather than paintings, of anatomy. As result he became a legend during his time after his work in Johns Hopkins Hospital. Some of his many illustrations were those of the anatomy of the urinary tract and instruments used to treat the urinary diseases. The museum was formally established in 1971 as the William P. Didusch Museum, following Didusch's gift to the American Urological Association of his many original urological drawings. It was accommodated within the headquarters buildings of the AUA, then on Charles Street in Baltimore. Didusch curated the museum until his death in 1981, when he was succeeded by Herbert Brendler. After Brendler's death in 1986, William W. Scott (a colleague of Nobel Laureate Charles Huggins at the University of Chicago) became curator of the museum. When Scott retired in 1993, the post of curator went to Rainer Engel of Johns Hopkins. In 2003 \u2013 when the AUA moved to Linthicum, Maryland \u2013 the museum also moved. Its scope was extended to relate to the topic of research in urologic history. Engel remained curator until 2011, when Michael Moran took over the position.\n\nCollection\n\nThe museum provides 300 years of the history of urology, beginning from early and extremely dangerous kidney stone surgeries to modern ultra sound treatments that \"pulverizes these jagged mineral clumps without any need to enter the body\". It includes illustrations, urological tools such as catheters, cystoscopes (includes Nitze cystoscopes made in 1890 with platinum loops for illumination and rotating cystoscopes), operating resectoscopes, laparoscopes, lithotriptors, and resectoscopes; some of this urologic equipment was sterilized using formaldehyde or cyanide. All was donated by urologists, including Ernest F. Hock of Binghamton, New York, Hans Reuter of Stuttgart, Germany and Adolf A. Kutzmann of Los Angeles.The Center also aids research in all fields of urologic history in the United States. It contains an extensive urological library, with early urological and medical texts, and the AUA archives.Current AUA Historian Engel considers the museum to show how medical history in urology evolved, and notes that the implements on display frequently scare visitors. Amongst its items are \"long, thick metal tubes that once opened the floodgates between some unfortunate soul's bladder and the outside world\", lassoes and nutcrackers on the end of steel tubes to break bladder stones, and Hugh Hampton Young's \"Prostate Punch\", which resembles a \"massively enlarged and curved hypodermic needle designed for the blind resection of prostate tissues\", used in prostate surgery (to ream out the tube of prostate tissue blindly); this last implement was used on the wealthy railway magnate Diamond Jim Brady, who\u2014cured of a prostate problem\u2014gave a generous donation to Johns Hopkins which enabled the establishment of the Brady Urological Institute and also the museum.A number of very large mineral samples of kidney stones are also on display. The collection in the museum also includes more than 30 microscopes dating as far back as the 18th century, along with operating manuals; this acquisition on loan from a German urology family.A popular display is the \"spermatorrhea ring\", a device from the early 20th century used to prevent ejaculations while sleeping. It is made of a double ring of metal, with the inner ring clipped over the penis and the outer ring, which is lined on the inside with an armature of blunt metal teeth, on the shaft. These teeth constitute what could be called the \"medically active ingredient\". In the event of voluntary unknowing erection while sleeping, \"the sensitive skin of the engorged part expands against the spiky outer ring, and the sleeper is pricked into consciousness in time to prevent nature from committing an unspeakable crime against itself\".\nPassage 3:\nLake City-Columbia County Historical Museum\nLake City-Columbia County Historical Museum is a living history museum at the May Vinzant Perkins House in Lake City, Florida.\n\nHistory\nThe Lake City-Columbia County Historical Museum is located in the Vinzant House. The house was built in the 1880s and purchased by John Vinzant Jr. for $450. Vinzant had come to Lake City after serving in the American Civil War as a sergeant in the 1st Florida Cavalry. Vinzant was the Columbia County Clerk of the Circuit Court and County Tax Collector. Vinzant also contributed to the Florida Agricultural College Fund when it was established about 1 mile south from the house in 1888. Vinzant was married to Mattie Vinzant and had three daughters: Cronin Ives, Birdie Livingston and May Perkins. John Vinzant died in 1907. Vinzant's youngest daughter May Perkins was married to Herbert Perkins and moved away to Washington, D.C. In 1912 May Perkins had a son but he died in infancy and then her husband died shortly afterwards. May Perkins returned to her father's house in Lake City. May Perkins' mother Mattied died in 1926 leaving her to live alone at the house until her death in 1981 at 102 years old. Perkins became a notable Lake City poet and historian. Since the death of Perkins in 1981 the house is still called the May Vinzant Perkins house. \nThe Historic Preservation Board of Lake City and Columbia County jointly bought the house with the Blue-Grey Army, Inc. in 1983. The two groups wanted to restore the house and make it a historical and cultural center as well as a museum. The house was renovated in 1984 by the Blue-Grey Army to turn the May Vinzant Perkins house into a museum as well as to save the house from being demolished since it was in poor condition. In 2000 a plaque was placed on the front of the house commemorating May Vinzant Perkins as a notable Floridian.Lake City holds an annual Battle of Olustee festival in downtown. Events are held at the Lake City-Columbia County Museum related to civil war history such as caring for wounded civil war soldiers or performing plays in relation to the civil war. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic the museum had to close from March to the second week of May 2020.\n\nBlue-Grey Army\nThe Blue-Grey Army is an organization that has collected civil war artifacts and annually sponsors the Battle of Olustee Festival in Lake City. The organization jointly bought the Vinzant house with the Lake City Columbia County Historical Society. A room in the museum holds the Blue-Grey Army's civil war artifacts and is called the Blue-Grey Army room.\n\nGallery\nPassage 4:\nHistorical Museum of Serbia\nThe Historical Museum of Serbia (Serbian: \u0418\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0458\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u043c\u0443\u0437\u0435\u0458 \u0421\u0440\u0431\u0438\u0458\u0435/Istorijski muzej Srbije, IMUS) is a public institution dedicated to documentation of history of Serbia from prehistory up to the present. The museum was established in 1963 and today it preserves over 35,000 exhibits in its collection. Over the years the museum was located at different locations around the capital city of Belgrade. In 2020, as a part of the Belgrade Waterfront development project, the museum was granted the historical building of the Belgrade Main railway station as its new permanent base. The museum is one of the leading institutions of its kind in the city and the country.\n\nHistory\nThe first unsuccessful initiative to establish the museum was taken in 1950 with the enactment of the Decree on the establishment of the History Museum of the People's Republic of Serbia. The proposal was reinitiated in 1954 with the establishment of the Serbian Revolution Museum (hosted by the Residence of Prince Milo\u0161) commemorating the 150th anniversary of the First Serbian Uprising.The Historical Museum of Serbia was established by the decision of the People's Republic of Serbia authorities on 20 February 1963 with the new institution absorbing the Serbian Revolution Museum. The task of the Museum was defined in 1966 as follows: \u2033to collect, record, store, arrange, study and exhibit material from the history of the Serbian people and Serbia from the earliest times to the present day\u2033.Until 2003 the museum published the  scientific journal Zbornik Istorijskog muzeja Srbije. Initially, from 1954 to 1965, it was published by the Serbian Revolution Museum.In November 2020 the Serbian government made the decision to relocate the museum to a far bigger building, which formerly served as Belgrade Main railway station.\n\nSee also\nList of museums in Serbia\nPassage 5:\nMuseum of the Sea (Uruguay)\nThe Museum of the Sea, opened in 1996, is a museum of natural history located in La Barra, in the department of Maldonado, Uruguay.

Among these specimens are whale skeletons, sea urchins, starfish and turtle shells. In addition, there are old photographs and an old bathing machine used by women in the early days of the 20th century, as well as telescopes and blunderbusses of the period. There is also an exhibit about the most famous pirates. This huge collection of objects, exhibits, photographs and stories is the work of the museum's creator, Pablo Etchegaray. This self-taught collector began his collection of marine-related items many years ago.\n\nExhibit halls\nThe Museum of the Sea is composed of four museums in one. In the Museum of the Sea, everything is related to marine life: whale skeletons, seashells, a deep sea room, interactive exhibits, an area where children can draw their own pictures, a section devoted to pirates and another to treasure. The Beach Resort Museum shows the history of holiday resorts, some of which are now city neighbourhoods, such as Pocitos and Carrasco, while others are tourist destinations, such as Punta del Este, La Paloma, Piri\u00e1polis, Atl\u00e1ntida, Mar del Plata and Copacabana. The Nostalgia Museum holds collections of vintage objects such as jars, tins, radio sets, medical remedies, photographs, and beach-related items such as beach umbrellas and pails that were used decades ago. Three collections and 38,000 specimens of insects are exhibited in the Insectarium. Most of the specimens are beetles, but there are also moths, cicadas, and grasshoppers, among other species.\nPassage 6:\nJoliet Area Historical Museum\nThe Joliet Area Historical Museum is a historical museum located in Joliet, Illinois.  The museum documents the history of Joliet and surrounding Will County.\n\nDescription and history\nThe museum adaptively reuses an urban space formerly occupied by the Ottawa Street Methodist Church, which was designed by Joliet architect G. Julian Barnes and built in 1909.  Located on one of the alternate paths of old historic U.S. Route 66, the museum's modern ground-floor addition features the Route 66 Welcome Center, which presents a permanent exhibit called the Route 66 Experience.  This newer part of the museum also connects to the historic Joliet Chamber of Commerce Clubhouse next door (now known as the Renaissance Center of the City Center campus of Joliet Junior College) and to the JJC Renaissance Center's main dining room, which is staffed by the college's hospitality and culinary school students and open to the public.During the late 20th century, formerly rural Will County townships grew rapidly, while properties in central city Joliet were threatened.  In 2002, the former church's urban space was reconfigured as a historic museum.  A separate wing is home to an exhibit about the Joliet-raised NASA engineer and JJC graduate John C. Houbolt, honored as the chief conceptualizer of the lunar orbit rendezvous segment of the U.S. Apollo program and the use of a lunar module to shuttle astronauts to and from the surface of the Moon.The museum is located at 204 N. Ottawa Street in central Joliet.  An admission fee is charged.As of 2014, the museum was seeking to establish guided tours of the landmark former Collins Street Prison for Route 66 travelers and other interested tourists. As of 2018, the museum began providing tours of the Collins Street Prison.\nPassage 7:\nAalborg Historical Museum\nAalborg Historical Museum (Danish: Aalborg Historiske Museum) is a historical and cultural museum in the city of Aalborg in Denmark.

Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\nDon River (North Queensland)\nThe Don River is a river in North Queensland, Australia.\n\nCourse and features\nThe Don River rises in the Clarke Range, part of the Great Dividing Range, below Mount Roundhill and west of Proserpine. The river flows generally north by northeast through the Eungella National Park and is joined by thirteen minor tributaries, towards its mouth and empties into the Coral Sea north of Bowen. With a catchment area of 1,200 square kilometres (460 sq mi), the river descends 253 metres (830 ft) over its 60-kilometre (37 mi) course.High salinity levels have been recorded at the mouth of the river. Land use in the upper catchment is mostly beef cattle production with crops grown in the richer soils downstream.The river is crossed by the Bruce Highway via the Don River Bridge at Bowen.\n\nFlooding\nThe highest recorded flood was in 1970 when the river reached 7.25 metres (23.8 ft) at the Bowen Pumping Station. The river delta is particularly vulnerable to flooding during cyclones.Floods in 2008 left deposits of sand which raised the riverbed considerably. Approval to dredge sand was granted by the Queensland Government, however only about half of that has been removed in recent years. A flood in 2008 lead the Whitsunday Regional Council to create a channel so that similar flooding could be avoided.A management plan for the river was established late in 2008.  It included measures to encourage further sand extraction.\n\nSee also\n\nList of rivers of Australia \u00a7 Queensland\nPassage 2:\nBowen River (Queensland)\nThe Bowen River is a river in North Queensland, Australia.\n\nCourse and features\nFormed by the confluence of the Broken River and the Little Bowen River near Tent Hill in the Normanby Range, part of the Great Dividing Range, the Bowen River flows in a north-westerly direction along the base of the range then flows west across Emu Plains and is crossed by the Bowen Developmental Road just north of Havilah. The river then flows north-west again between the Herbert Range and Leichhardt Range then discharges into the Burdekin River, south southeast of Ravenswood. The river descends 98 metres (322 ft) over its 129-kilometre (80 mi) course.The catchment area of the river occupies 9,452 square kilometres (3,649 sq mi) of which an area of 236 square kilometres (91 sq mi) is composed of riverine wetlands. The catchment is in poor condition with much of the riparian habitat having been cleared and prone to erosion. The area is mostly used for cattle grazing with the towns of Collinsville and Glendon both drawing their town water supply from the Bowen River Weir. The river has a mean annual discharge of 1,618 gigalitres (3.56\u00d71011 imp gal; 4.27\u00d71011 US gal).The Bowen River Weir supplies water to a coal mine, power station and the township of Collinsville.\n\nHistory\nThe river was named in 1861 by the Queensland Government, derived from the name of the town Bowen which was named in honour of Sir George Bowen, a  Governor of Queensland.In the 1860s, Richard Daintree made mineral discoveries along the river. Daintree made the first systematic examination of the Bowen River coal seams near Collinsville.Circa 1865, the Bowen River Hotel was built at the top of a steep bank of the river (20.534\u00b0S 147.5562\u00b0E\ufeff / -20.534; 147.5562\ufeff (Bowen River Hotel)). The hotel is now listed on the Queensland Heritage Register.Construction of the Bowen River Weir commenced in April 1982 and was completed in August 1983.

During low tide, the river flows towards both the mouth and the origin, making it seem like it is being pulled both ways.\nIt is also said that the name came about during the Battle of Yashima, which was fought between the Minamoto and Taira clans.\nPassage 6:\nHaughton River\nThe Haughton River is a river in North Queensland, Australia.\n\nCourse and features\nThe headwaters of the river rise in the Haughton Valley of the Leichhardt Range near Mingela and flow in a north easterly direction almost immediately crossing the Flinders Highway. The river then passes between Mount Prince Charles and Mount Norman then past Glendale. Major Creek discharges into the Haughton under Major Creek Mountain and the river continues crossing the Bruce Highway just south of Giru. The Haughton enters Bowling Green Bay National Park and finally discharges into Bowling Green Bay south of Townsville near Cungulla and then into the Coral Sea.\nThe assessed catchment area of the river varies, with one estimate of the area at 8,690 square kilometres (3,360 sq mi) and another assessed at 4,051 square kilometres (1,564 sq mi). Of this latter area, 316 square kilometres (122 sq mi) is composed of estuarine wetlands.The floodplain area of the catchment also holds valuable wetlands, parts of the Bowling Green Bay National Park and Ramsar site (QDEH 1991) are listed in the Directory of Important Wetlands. The upper part of the catchment has few permanent waterholes. An estimated 77% of the catchment is cleared, cattle grazing is the dominant land use in the area, with the production of sugarcane and other forms of horticulture taking up most of the catchment area. An area of 328 square kilometres (127 sq mi) is protected.A total of 27 species of fish have been found in the river, including the glassfish, Pacific Short-finned Eel, blue catfish, milkfish, Fly-specked hardyhead, mouth almighty, Empire gudgeon, barred grunter, barramundi, oxeye herring, mangrove jack, eastern rainbowfish, Bony bream, Freshwater Longtom and Seven-spot Archerfish.\n\nEtymology\nThe river was named in 1861 after Richard Houghton, a stockman, by his friend the pastoralist and explorer James Cassady. Originally named Houghton River it was renamed to the current spelling by the Surveyor General in 1950 at the request of local residents and the electoral office.\n\nSee also\n\nList of rivers of Australia \u00a7 Queensland\nPassage 7:\nStuart River (Minnesota)\nThe Stuart River is a river located in Minnesota, in the United States.\n\nSee also\nList of rivers of Minnesota\nPassage 8:\nKakwa River\nThe Kakwa River is a tributary of the Smoky River in western Alberta, Canada.\nThe river is named for Kakwa, the Cree word for porcupine.

Kakwa Falls (54.10913\u00b0N 119.92350\u00b0W\ufeff / 54.10913; -119.92350\ufeff (Kakwa Falls)) are developed in the course of the river, over a 30-metre (98 ft) high ledge formed by an outcrop of the Cadomin Formation. The area was designated a protected wildland (Kakwa Wildland Park). It can be accessed through the forestry road network south of Highway 666, approximately 35 kilometres (22 mi) south of Two Lakes Provincial Park.\n\nCourse\nThe Kakwa River originates in Kakwa Lake, north of McBride, in British Columbia, at an elevation of 1,495 metres (4,905 ft).

The river then flows in a northerly direction through the settlement of Theodore where the river is again crossed by the Leichhardt Highway. The river flows north through the settlement of Baralaba and towards Duaringa, crossed by the Capricorn Highway. A little further north, the Dawson River forms confluence with the Mackenzie River to form the Fitzroy River. From source to mouth, the river is joined by sixty-four tributaries, including the Don River, and descends 587 metres (1,926 ft) over its 735-kilometre (457 mi) course. Several weirs have been constructed along the river to provide water for cotton and dairy farming in the region. The river catchment covers an area of 50,800 square kilometres (19,600 sq mi).Expedition National Park and the Precipice National Park are protected areas along the Dawson River.\nThe Dawson River was one of a number of Queensland rivers affected by the 2010\u201311 Queensland floods. As the river inundated the town of Theodore it was completely evacuated, a first in Queensland's history.\n\nHistory\nGungabula (also known as Kongabula and Khungabula) is an Australian Aboriginal language of the headwaters of the Dawson River in Central Queensland. The language region includes areas within the local government area of Maranoa Region, particularly the towns of Charleville, Augathella and Blackall and as well as the Carnarvon Range.Ludwig Leichhardt explored the area in 1844 and named the river in honour of Robert Dawson, one of Leichhardt's financial backers.In the 1920s, shortly after the First World War, Australian Labor Party politician Ted Theodore (1884-1950) launched an irrigation program on the Dawson River for returning soldiers. His intentions was to provide them with arable land along the river for them to take up farming, thus eschewing a post-war recession. After the 1922 Irrigation Act was passed, he started irrigation schemes on the Dawson River, for an initial 8,000 new farmers. However, the scheme was abandoned after he realized the soil was unsuitable for farming and the returning soldiers had no agrarian skills.\n\nSee also\n\nBoggomoss\nList of rivers of Australia \u00a7 Queensland\nPassage 10:\nDee River (Queensland)\nThe Dee River is a river in Central Queensland, Australia.\n\nCourse and features\nPart of the Fitzroy River system, the Dee River rises in the Razorback Range south of Bouldercombe Gorge Resources Reserve near Mount Gavial, south of Bouldercombe. The river flows generally south by west through the mining settlement of Mount Morgan, Waluml and Dululu, where the river is crossed by the Burnett Highway. The river is joined by seven minor tributaries including Limestone Creek, Horse Creek, Hamilton Creek, Nine Mile Creek, Boulder Creek, Oaky Creek and Pruce Creek.  The Dee River forms its confluence with the Don River near Rannes.\nThe largest dam on the river is Number 7 Dam, built for the Mount Morgan Mine, which has a history of acid mine discharge from gold and copper mining entering the Dee River.\n\nMine pit\nIn January 2013, the mine pit overflowed. Approximately 700 millimetres (28 in) of rain fell after ex-tropical Cyclone Oswald resulted in the 2013 Eastern Australia floods.  Towards the end of February the dam was spilling acid and heavy metals into the river.  Concerns regarding the discolouration of the river's water and fears of contamination causing irreversible damage to the river were raised in mid-2011.\n\nSee also\n\nList of rivers of Australia \u00a7 Queensland\n\nAnswer the question based on the given passages.

The river flows generally north by northeast through the Eungella National Park and is joined by thirteen minor tributaries, towards its mouth and empties into the Coral Sea north of Bowen. With a catchment area of 1,200 square kilometres (460 sq mi), the river descends 253 metres (830 ft) over its 60-kilometre (37 mi) course.High salinity levels have been recorded at the mouth of the river. Land use in the upper catchment is mostly beef cattle production with crops grown in the richer soils downstream.The river is crossed by the Bruce Highway via the Don River Bridge at Bowen.\n\nFlooding\nThe highest recorded flood was in 1970 when the river reached 7.25 metres (23.8 ft) at the Bowen Pumping Station. The river delta is particularly vulnerable to flooding during cyclones.Floods in 2008 left deposits of sand which raised the riverbed considerably. Approval to dredge sand was granted by the Queensland Government, however only about half of that has been removed in recent years. A flood in 2008 lead the Whitsunday Regional Council to create a channel so that similar flooding could be avoided.A management plan for the river was established late in 2008.  It included measures to encourage further sand extraction.\n\nSee also\n\nList of rivers of Australia \u00a7 Queensland\nPassage 2:\nBowen River (Queensland)\nThe Bowen River is a river in North Queensland, Australia.\n\nCourse and features\nFormed by the confluence of the Broken River and the Little Bowen River near Tent Hill in the Normanby Range, part of the Great Dividing Range, the Bowen River flows in a north-westerly direction along the base of the range then flows west across Emu Plains and is crossed by the Bowen Developmental Road just north of Havilah. The river then flows north-west again between the Herbert Range and Leichhardt Range then discharges into the Burdekin River, south southeast of Ravenswood. The river descends 98 metres (322 ft) over its 129-kilometre (80 mi) course.The catchment area of the river occupies 9,452 square kilometres (3,649 sq mi) of which an area of 236 square kilometres (91 sq mi) is composed of riverine wetlands. The catchment is in poor condition with much of the riparian habitat having been cleared and prone to erosion. The area is mostly used for cattle grazing with the towns of Collinsville and Glendon both drawing their town water supply from the Bowen River Weir. The river has a mean annual discharge of 1,618 gigalitres (3.56\u00d71011 imp gal; 4.27\u00d71011 US gal).The Bowen River Weir supplies water to a coal mine, power station and the township of Collinsville.\n\nHistory\nThe river was named in 1861 by the Queensland Government, derived from the name of the town Bowen which was named in honour of Sir George Bowen, a  Governor of Queensland.In the 1860s, Richard Daintree made mineral discoveries along the river. Daintree made the first systematic examination of the Bowen River coal seams near Collinsville.Circa 1865, the Bowen River Hotel was built at the top of a steep bank of the river (20.534\u00b0S 147.5562\u00b0E\ufeff / -20.534; 147.5562\ufeff (Bowen River Hotel)). The hotel is now listed on the Queensland Heritage Register.Construction of the Bowen River Weir commenced in April 1982 and was completed in August 1983.

During low tide, the river flows towards both the mouth and the origin, making it seem like it is being pulled both ways.\nIt is also said that the name came about during the Battle of Yashima, which was fought between the Minamoto and Taira clans.\nPassage 6:\nHaughton River\nThe Haughton River is a river in North Queensland, Australia.\n\nCourse and features\nThe headwaters of the river rise in the Haughton Valley of the Leichhardt Range near Mingela and flow in a north easterly direction almost immediately crossing the Flinders Highway. The river then passes between Mount Prince Charles and Mount Norman then past Glendale. Major Creek discharges into the Haughton under Major Creek Mountain and the river continues crossing the Bruce Highway just south of Giru. The Haughton enters Bowling Green Bay National Park and finally discharges into Bowling Green Bay south of Townsville near Cungulla and then into the Coral Sea.\nThe assessed catchment area of the river varies, with one estimate of the area at 8,690 square kilometres (3,360 sq mi) and another assessed at 4,051 square kilometres (1,564 sq mi). Of this latter area, 316 square kilometres (122 sq mi) is composed of estuarine wetlands.The floodplain area of the catchment also holds valuable wetlands, parts of the Bowling Green Bay National Park and Ramsar site (QDEH 1991) are listed in the Directory of Important Wetlands. The upper part of the catchment has few permanent waterholes. An estimated 77% of the catchment is cleared, cattle grazing is the dominant land use in the area, with the production of sugarcane and other forms of horticulture taking up most of the catchment area. An area of 328 square kilometres (127 sq mi) is protected.A total of 27 species of fish have been found in the river, including the glassfish, Pacific Short-finned Eel, blue catfish, milkfish, Fly-specked hardyhead, mouth almighty, Empire gudgeon, barred grunter, barramundi, oxeye herring, mangrove jack, eastern rainbowfish, Bony bream, Freshwater Longtom and Seven-spot Archerfish.\n\nEtymology\nThe river was named in 1861 after Richard Houghton, a stockman, by his friend the pastoralist and explorer James Cassady. Originally named Houghton River it was renamed to the current spelling by the Surveyor General in 1950 at the request of local residents and the electoral office.\n\nSee also\n\nList of rivers of Australia \u00a7 Queensland\nPassage 7:\nStuart River (Minnesota)\nThe Stuart River is a river located in Minnesota, in the United States.\n\nSee also\nList of rivers of Minnesota\nPassage 8:\nKakwa River\nThe Kakwa River is a tributary of the Smoky River in western Alberta, Canada.\nThe river is named for Kakwa, the Cree word for porcupine.

The count's sister Irmgard was married to Lothair Udo III, Margrave of the Nordmark, and was the mother of Helperich's successor in ruling the margraviate, Henry II.\nHelperich inherited the title Count of Pl\u00f6tzkau upon his father\u2019s death and the title Count of Walbeck from his mother, although this title was mostly ceremonial at this point.  In 1112, Emperor Henry V deposed Rudolf I as Margrave of the Nordmark because of conspiracy against the crown in his alliance with Lothair of Supplinburg, then Duke of Saxony (and later Holy Roman Emperor).  The margraviate was given to Helperich as an interim measure until Henry II, nephew of Rudolf and heir to the title, was of age.\nIn 1106, Helperich married Adele, daughter of Kuno of Northeim and Kunigunde of Weimar-Orlam\u00fcnde, widow of Dietrich III, Count of Katlenburg.

Brother of his predecessor Henry I the Long.\nLothair Udo was betrothed to Eilika of Saxony, daughter of Magnus, Duke of Saxony, and Sophia of Hungary. However, his attention was diverted to the House of Helperich, towards Count Helperich's enticing sister Ermengardam.  He married this woman, the count's sister Irmgard, daughter of Dietrich, Count of Pl\u00f6tzkau, and Mathilde von Walbeck, daughter of Conrad, Count of Walbeck.  Eilika moved on and married Otto the Rich, Count of Ballenstedt, and was mother to Albert the Bear, the last Margrave of the Nordmark and first Margrave of Brandenburg.

His father Otto I promoted and directed the foundation of German settlement in the area, which had been Slavic until the 10th century.\n\nCount of Arneburg\nAlbert II was, from 1184 onwards, Count of Arneburg in the Altmark.  The Altmark belonged to Brandenburg, and his older brother Otto II claimed that this implied that the Ascanians owned Arneburg.\nWhen Henry of Gardeleggen died in 1192, he left his domains to Albert II. But that caused a conflict between himself and his brother. He was temporarily imprisoned in 1194 by Otto.\nIn 1197, he joined the German Crusade of 1197. He was present at the inaugural meeting of the Teutonic Knights in 1198 in Acre.\n\nMargrave of Brandenburg\nAlbert II inherited the Margraviate in 1205, after the death of his eldest brother Otto II.\nIn the dispute about the imperial crown between the Houses of Hohenstaufen and Guelph in the early 13th century, Albert initially supported the Hohenstaufen King Philip of Swabia, like Otto before him.  After Philip's assassination in 1208, however, he changed sides, because Emperor Otto IV had assisted him in securing the Margraviate against the Danes, and had confirmed Ascanian ownership of Brandenburg in a deed in 1212.\nDuring this period, Albert II had a lengthy dispute with Archbishop Albert I of Magdeburg. He also played an important r\u00f4le in the Brandenburg tithe dispute.\nAlbert II definitively secured the regions of Teltow, Prignitz and parts of the Uckermark for the Margraviate of Brandenburg, but lost Pomerania to the House of Griffins.\n\nDeath and succession\nAlbert II died in 1220.  At the time, his two sons were still minors.  Initially, archbishop Albert I of Magdeburg acted as regent.  In 1221, however, Albert's widow, Countess Matilda, took up the regency.  After her death in 1225, the brothers were declared legal adults and began ruling the Margraviate jointly.\n\nLegacy\nStephan Warnatsch describes Otto I's children as follows:[They] continued the territorialisation drive that had been initiated [by their father] and, from the end of the 12th Century, as the influx of settlers grew stronger, and, consequently, more people were available to develop the territory, started to expand into the areas of Ruppin, and in particular, Barnim and Teltow.  Moreover, the Oder region and the southern Uckermark were also targets of the Ascanian expansion.  In all these areas, the Ascanians ran into opposition from competing local princes.\n\nMarriage and issue\nIn 1205, Albert married Matilda of Groitzsch (1185\u20131225), daughter of the Count Conrad II of Lusatia, a member of the House of Wettin, and wife Elizabeth, from the Polish Piast dynasty.  They had four children:\n\nJohn I (born: c.\u20091213; died: 4 April 1266)\nOtto III \"the Pious\" (born: 1215; died: 9 October 1267)\nMatilda (died: 10 June 1261), married in 1228 Duke Otto I \"the Child\" of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg (1204\u20131252), a member of the House of Guelph\nElizabeth (born: 1207; died: 19 November 1231), married in 1228 Landgrave Henry Raspe of Thuringia (1201\u20131247)\nPassage 4:\nHenry II, Margrave of Baden-Hachberg\nHenry II, Margrave of Baden-Hachberg (before 1231 \u2013 c.\u20091297/1298) was the ruling Margrave of Baden-Hachberg from 1231 to 1289.\n\nLife\nHenry II was the eldest son of Margrave Henry I of Baden-Hachberg and his wife, Agnes, a daughter of Count Egino IV of Urach.  In 1231, he succeeded his father as Margrave of Baden-Hachberg.  Since he was a minor at the time, he initially stood under the guardianship of his mother.  He was the first in his line of the House of Z\u00e4hringen to style himself Margrave of Hachberg.  In 1232, he purchased the Lordship of Sausenburg from St. Blaise Abbey.  Soon afterwards, he built Sausenburg Castle, which was first mentioned in 1246.He had disputes with the spiritual rulers in the area and with the Counts of Freiburg about the entangled rights and privileges they had (or claimed to have) on each other's possessions.  In 1250, some imperial and Hohenstaufen possessions became available for the taking after Emperor Frederick II had died.  Henry II grabbed some of these land and managed round off his territory.\nFor several years, he supported Count Rudolph of Habsburg in his disputes against the bishops of Basel and Strasbourg.  In 1273, he supported Rudolph in his bid to become King of the Romans.  He also supported Rudolph in his dispute against the main line of the Margraves of Baden.  During the war against Bohemia, Henry II fought on the imperial side in the decisive Battle on the Marchfeld.\nHe was a patron of the monasteries Tennenbach and Adelhausen.Henry II abdicated in 1289, and joined the Teutonic Knights.\n\nMarriage and issue\nHenry II was married to Anne, a daughter of Count Rudolph II of \u00dcsingen-Ketzingen.

The previous margrave in this dynasty was Henry\u2019s uncle Rudolf I, who was also his guardian.  Rudolf was deposed by Emperor Henry V because of conspiracy against the crown, and was replaced by Helperich as an interim measure.  Henry assumed the titles of Count of Stade and Margrave of the Nordmark in 1114.\nHenry was married to Adelaide of Ballenstedt, a daughter of Otto, Count of Ballenstedt, and Eilika of Saxony.  Adelaide was therefore the sister of Albert the Bear. There are no known children as a result of this union.  Henry was succeeded as margrave by the son of Helperich, Conrad of Pl\u00f6tzkau.\n\nSources\nKrause, Karl Ernst Hermann, Lothar Udo II. und das Stader Grafenhaus. In: Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie.

He was the posthumous son of Margrave Henry I and Gertrude of Brunswick, daughter of Egbert I of Meissen. He was by inheritance also Count of Eilenburg. He was the second Meissener margrave of the House of Wettin.\nHe was initially under the regency of first his mother and after her death in 1117 under his great uncle Thimo. He died young and without children in 1123. His lands were inherited by his half-sister Richenza of Northeim. He left a widow, Adelaide, daughter of Lothair Udo III, Margrave of the Nordmark. The succession to the marches was disputed after his death.\nPassage 7:\nRudolf II, Margrave of the Nordmark\nRudolf II (died 14 March 1144), Margrave of the Nordmark, and Count of Stade, Dithmarschen and Freckleben, son of Rudolf I, Margrave of the Nordmark, and Richardis, daughter of Hermann von Sponheim, Burgrave of Magdeburg.\nRudolf, the traditional heir to the margraviate assumed the title upon the death of his predecessor Conrad von Pl\u00f6tzkau.\nA chronicle of the 15th century reported that Rudolf resided in Burg, Dithmarschen (B\u00f6kelnburg). He ruled with a heavy hand and demanded his grain tithe even after several years of drought. The Dithmarscher farmers used a ruse to get rid of their unpopular regent. Hidden in sacks of corn were weapons.  As agreed, they opened the bags at the sound of the battle cry \"R\u00f6hret de Hann, snidet de sac spell!\" (Shall ye touch hands, cuts the bag volumes). They set the castle on fire, killed the count and so won their freedom. This event is still recounted today in performances at the castle. His widow, Elizabeth, later married Henry V, Duke of Carinthia.Rudolf was married to Elisabeth, daughter of Leopold I the Strong, Margrave of Styria. No children are recorded of this union. With the death of Rudolf, the male line of the Margraves of the Nordmark died out.\nAfter the death of Rudolf, his brother Hartwig transferred his inheritance to the Archbishopric of Bremen in return for a regrant of a life interest, presumably to obtain a powerful protector against the aggression of Henry the Lion.  The move was ineffective, as Henry took possession of the lands and captured both Hartwig and the archbishop Adelbero, releasing them only after they agreed to recognize his claim.\nRudolf\u2019s successor as Margrave of the Nordmark was Albert the Bear.  Upon Rudolf's death, his brother Hartwig succeeded him as Count of Stade.\nPassage 8:\nHenry I the Long, Margrave of the Nordmark\nHenry I the Long (c. 1065 \u2013 27 June 1087), Margrave of the Nordmark, also Count of Stade (as Henry III), son of Lothair Udo II, Margrave of the Nordmark, and Oda of Werl, daughter of Herman III, Count of Werl, and Richenza of Swabia.\nHenry married Eupraxia of Kiev, daughter of Vsevolod I, Grand Prince of Kiev, and his second wife Anna.  There were no children as a result of this marriage, and Eupraxia, widowed, married next Henry IV, then King of Saxony, who became Holy Roman Emperor.\nRaffensperger suggests that Henry's motivation in marrying Eupraxia was to bring Saxony closer to Kiev.  In fact, the marriage may have been arranged by Oda of Stade, daughter of Lothair Udo I, Margrave of the Nordmark, who had married Sviatoslav II, Grand Prince of Kiev. Oda is identified as a relative of Henry\u2019s father Lothair Udo II as well as a niece of Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor, and Pope Leo IX.\nUpon his death, Henry was succeeded as margrave and count by his brother Lothair Udo III.\n\nNotes\nSources\nVernadsky, George, Kievan Russia, Yale University Press, New Haven, Connecticut, 1948, ISBN 9780300010077\nRaffensperger, Christian, Reimagining Europe: Kievan Rus' in the Medieval World, Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts, 2012\nH.

He was the second son of Otto II, Margrave of Meissen and Hedwig of Brandenburg.\n\nBiography\nTheodoric, called in German Dietrich, the younger son of Otto II, Margrave of Meissen, fell out with his brother, Albert the Proud, after his mother persuaded his father to change the succession so that Theodoric was given the Margraviate of Meissen and Albrecht (although the older son) the margraviate of Weissenfels. Albert took his father prisoner to try to make him return the succession to the way it had been. After Otto obtained his release by an order of the emperor Frederick I, he had only just renewed the war when he died in 1190. Albert then took back the Meissen margraviate from his brother. Theodoric attempted to regain the margraviate, supported by Landgraf Hermann I of Thuringia, his father-in-law. In 1195, however, Theodoric left on a pilgrimage to Palestine.\n\nAlbrecht's Death\nAfter Albrecht's death in 1195, leaving no children, Meissen, with its rich mines, was seized by the emperor Henry VI as a vacant fief of the empire. Dietrich finally came into possession of his inheritance two years later on Henry's death.\nAt the time of the struggle between the two rival kings Philip of Swabia and Otto IV, Holy Roman Emperor, Phillip gave Dietrich the tenure of the march of Mei\u00dfen again. After that time, Dietrich was on Phillip's side and remained true to the Staufer even after Phillip was murdered in 1208.\nDietrich became caught up in dangerous disagreements with the city of Leipzig and the Mei\u00dfen nobility. After a fruitless siege of Leipzig, in 1217 he agreed to a settlement but then took over the city by trickery, had the city walls taken down and built three castles of his own within the city, full of his own men.\n\nDeath\nMargrave Dietrich died on 18 February 1221, possibly poisoned by his doctor, instigated into doing so by the people of Leipzig and the dissatisfied nobility. He left behind a widow, Jutta of Thuringia, daughter of Hermann I, Landgrave of Thuringia. Some of his children had already died.\n\nMarriages and issue\nChildren from his marriage to Jutta of Thuringia, daughter of Hermann I, Landgrave of Thuringia:\nHedwig (d. 1249) married Count Dietrich V of Cleves (1185\u20131260)\nOtto (d. before 1215)\nSophia (d. 1280) married Count Henry of Henneberg-Schleusingen (d. 1262)\nJutta married Mestwin II, Duke of Pomerania\nHenry the Illustrious (1218\u20131288) Margrave of MeissenChildren from extramarital liaisons:\n\nKonrad\nDietrich II (not the same as Dietrich von Kittlitz)\nHeinrich\nPassage 10:\nWilliam, Margrave of the Nordmark\nWilliam (died 10 September 1056) was the Margrave of the Nordmark from 1051 until his death.

The count's sister Irmgard was married to Lothair Udo III, Margrave of the Nordmark, and was the mother of Helperich's successor in ruling the margraviate, Henry II.\nHelperich inherited the title Count of Pl\u00f6tzkau upon his father\u2019s death and the title Count of Walbeck from his mother, although this title was mostly ceremonial at this point.  In 1112, Emperor Henry V deposed Rudolf I as Margrave of the Nordmark because of conspiracy against the crown in his alliance with Lothair of Supplinburg, then Duke of Saxony (and later Holy Roman Emperor).  The margraviate was given to Helperich as an interim measure until Henry II, nephew of Rudolf and heir to the title, was of age.\nIn 1106, Helperich married Adele, daughter of Kuno of Northeim and Kunigunde of Weimar-Orlam\u00fcnde, widow of Dietrich III, Count of Katlenburg.

However, his attention was diverted to the House of Helperich, towards Count Helperich's enticing sister Ermengardam.  He married this woman, the count's sister Irmgard, daughter of Dietrich, Count of Pl\u00f6tzkau, and Mathilde von Walbeck, daughter of Conrad, Count of Walbeck.  Eilika moved on and married Otto the Rich, Count of Ballenstedt, and was mother to Albert the Bear, the last Margrave of the Nordmark and first Margrave of Brandenburg.

His father Otto I promoted and directed the foundation of German settlement in the area, which had been Slavic until the 10th century.\n\nCount of Arneburg\nAlbert II was, from 1184 onwards, Count of Arneburg in the Altmark.  The Altmark belonged to Brandenburg, and his older brother Otto II claimed that this implied that the Ascanians owned Arneburg.\nWhen Henry of Gardeleggen died in 1192, he left his domains to Albert II. But that caused a conflict between himself and his brother. He was temporarily imprisoned in 1194 by Otto.\nIn 1197, he joined the German Crusade of 1197. He was present at the inaugural meeting of the Teutonic Knights in 1198 in Acre.\n\nMargrave of Brandenburg\nAlbert II inherited the Margraviate in 1205, after the death of his eldest brother Otto II.\nIn the dispute about the imperial crown between the Houses of Hohenstaufen and Guelph in the early 13th century, Albert initially supported the Hohenstaufen King Philip of Swabia, like Otto before him.  After Philip's assassination in 1208, however, he changed sides, because Emperor Otto IV had assisted him in securing the Margraviate against the Danes, and had confirmed Ascanian ownership of Brandenburg in a deed in 1212.\nDuring this period, Albert II had a lengthy dispute with Archbishop Albert I of Magdeburg. He also played an important r\u00f4le in the Brandenburg tithe dispute.\nAlbert II definitively secured the regions of Teltow, Prignitz and parts of the Uckermark for the Margraviate of Brandenburg, but lost Pomerania to the House of Griffins.\n\nDeath and succession\nAlbert II died in 1220.  At the time, his two sons were still minors.  Initially, archbishop Albert I of Magdeburg acted as regent.  In 1221, however, Albert's widow, Countess Matilda, took up the regency.  After her death in 1225, the brothers were declared legal adults and began ruling the Margraviate jointly.\n\nLegacy\nStephan Warnatsch describes Otto I's children as follows:[They] continued the territorialisation drive that had been initiated [by their father] and, from the end of the 12th Century, as the influx of settlers grew stronger, and, consequently, more people were available to develop the territory, started to expand into the areas of Ruppin, and in particular, Barnim and Teltow.  Moreover, the Oder region and the southern Uckermark were also targets of the Ascanian expansion.  In all these areas, the Ascanians ran into opposition from competing local princes.\n\nMarriage and issue\nIn 1205, Albert married Matilda of Groitzsch (1185\u20131225), daughter of the Count Conrad II of Lusatia, a member of the House of Wettin, and wife Elizabeth, from the Polish Piast dynasty.  They had four children:\n\nJohn I (born: c.\u20091213; died: 4 April 1266)\nOtto III \"the Pious\" (born: 1215; died: 9 October 1267)\nMatilda (died: 10 June 1261), married in 1228 Duke Otto I \"the Child\" of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg (1204\u20131252), a member of the House of Guelph\nElizabeth (born: 1207; died: 19 November 1231), married in 1228 Landgrave Henry Raspe of Thuringia (1201\u20131247)\nPassage 4:\nHenry II, Margrave of Baden-Hachberg\nHenry II, Margrave of Baden-Hachberg (before 1231 \u2013 c.\u20091297/1298) was the ruling Margrave of Baden-Hachberg from 1231 to 1289.\n\nLife\nHenry II was the eldest son of Margrave Henry I of Baden-Hachberg and his wife, Agnes, a daughter of Count Egino IV of Urach.  In 1231, he succeeded his father as Margrave of Baden-Hachberg.  Since he was a minor at the time, he initially stood under the guardianship of his mother.  He was the first in his line of the House of Z\u00e4hringen to style himself Margrave of Hachberg.  In 1232, he purchased the Lordship of Sausenburg from St. Blaise Abbey.  Soon afterwards, he built Sausenburg Castle, which was first mentioned in 1246.He had disputes with the spiritual rulers in the area and with the Counts of Freiburg about the entangled rights and privileges they had (or claimed to have) on each other's possessions.  In 1250, some imperial and Hohenstaufen possessions became available for the taking after Emperor Frederick II had died.  Henry II grabbed some of these land and managed round off his territory.\nFor several years, he supported Count Rudolph of Habsburg in his disputes against the bishops of Basel and Strasbourg.  In 1273, he supported Rudolph in his bid to become King of the Romans.  He also supported Rudolph in his dispute against the main line of the Margraves of Baden.  During the war against Bohemia, Henry II fought on the imperial side in the decisive Battle on the Marchfeld.\nHe was a patron of the monasteries Tennenbach and Adelhausen.Henry II abdicated in 1289, and joined the Teutonic Knights.\n\nMarriage and issue\nHenry II was married to Anne, a daughter of Count Rudolph II of \u00dcsingen-Ketzingen.  They had the following children:\n\nHenry III, his successor as Margrave of Baden-Hachberg\nRudolf I, the first Margrave of Hachberg-Sausenberg\nFrederick, who also joined the Teutonic Knights\nVerena, married Egino I, Count of F\u00fcrstenberg\nHerman I, joined the Knights Hospitaller\nKunigunde, a nun at Adelhausen\nAgnes, married Walter of Reichenberg\nElisabeth, also a nun at Adelhausen\nPassage 5:\nHenry II, Margrave of the Nordmark\nHenry II (1102 \u2013 4 December 1128), Margrave of the Nordmark, also Count of Stade (as Henry IV), son of Lothair Udo III, Margrave of the Nordmark, and  Irmgard, daughter of Dietrich, Count of Pl\u00f6tzkau, and Mathilde von Walbeck.\nHenry assumed the title of Margrave of the Nordmark in 1114 from Helperich of Pl\u00f6tzkau, who was appointed margrave until Henry came of age. The previous margrave in this dynasty was Henry\u2019s uncle Rudolf I, who was also his guardian.  Rudolf was deposed by Emperor Henry V because of conspiracy against the crown, and was replaced by Helperich as an interim measure.  Henry assumed the titles of Count of Stade and Margrave of the Nordmark in 1114.\nHenry was married to Adelaide of Ballenstedt, a daughter of Otto, Count of Ballenstedt, and Eilika of Saxony.  Adelaide was therefore the sister of Albert the Bear. There are no known children as a result of this union.  Henry was succeeded as margrave by the son of Helperich, Conrad of Pl\u00f6tzkau.\n\nSources\nKrause, Karl Ernst Hermann, Lothar Udo II. und das Stader Grafenhaus. In: Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie.

He was the second Meissener margrave of the House of Wettin.\nHe was initially under the regency of first his mother and after her death in 1117 under his great uncle Thimo. He died young and without children in 1123. His lands were inherited by his half-sister Richenza of Northeim. He left a widow, Adelaide, daughter of Lothair Udo III, Margrave of the Nordmark. The succession to the marches was disputed after his death.\nPassage 7:\nRudolf II, Margrave of the Nordmark\nRudolf II (died 14 March 1144), Margrave of the Nordmark, and Count of Stade, Dithmarschen and Freckleben, son of Rudolf I, Margrave of the Nordmark, and Richardis, daughter of Hermann von Sponheim, Burgrave of Magdeburg.\nRudolf, the traditional heir to the margraviate assumed the title upon the death of his predecessor Conrad von Pl\u00f6tzkau.\nA chronicle of the 15th century reported that Rudolf resided in Burg, Dithmarschen (B\u00f6kelnburg). He ruled with a heavy hand and demanded his grain tithe even after several years of drought. The Dithmarscher farmers used a ruse to get rid of their unpopular regent. Hidden in sacks of corn were weapons.  As agreed, they opened the bags at the sound of the battle cry \"R\u00f6hret de Hann, snidet de sac spell!\" (Shall ye touch hands, cuts the bag volumes). They set the castle on fire, killed the count and so won their freedom. This event is still recounted today in performances at the castle. His widow, Elizabeth, later married Henry V, Duke of Carinthia.Rudolf was married to Elisabeth, daughter of Leopold I the Strong, Margrave of Styria. No children are recorded of this union. With the death of Rudolf, the male line of the Margraves of the Nordmark died out.\nAfter the death of Rudolf, his brother Hartwig transferred his inheritance to the Archbishopric of Bremen in return for a regrant of a life interest, presumably to obtain a powerful protector against the aggression of Henry the Lion.  The move was ineffective, as Henry took possession of the lands and captured both Hartwig and the archbishop Adelbero, releasing them only after they agreed to recognize his claim.\nRudolf\u2019s successor as Margrave of the Nordmark was Albert the Bear.

There were no children as a result of this marriage, and Eupraxia, widowed, married next Henry IV, then King of Saxony, who became Holy Roman Emperor.\nRaffensperger suggests that Henry's motivation in marrying Eupraxia was to bring Saxony closer to Kiev.  In fact, the marriage may have been arranged by Oda of Stade, daughter of Lothair Udo I, Margrave of the Nordmark, who had married Sviatoslav II, Grand Prince of Kiev.

Simpson's father was Robert Simpson and his mother was Mary Ann Smith Simpson.\n\nCareer\nIn about 1905, Simpson started working in the palm-oil business, trading with West Africa.\nIn 1907, Simpson emigrated to the United States. In 1916, Simpson became an editor at the Frank A. Munsey Company.  In 1917, Simpson was promoted to managing editor of The Argosy, and stayed in that role for three years.  He left in 1920 to become a free-lance writer, and returned to editing in 1925, becoming the editor of Mystery Magazine.Simpson's novels include The Bite of Benin, Swamp Breath, The Grey Charteris, Eight Panes of Glass, and Calvert of Allobar.\n\nPersonal life\nSimpson was married to Marie A. Simpson, n\u00e9e Socin, and they had a daughter and two sons.\nPassage 4:\nThomas Wykes (MP for Cambridgeshire)\nThomas Wykes (died c. 1430), of Stetchworth, Cambridgeshire, was an English politician.\nHe was a Member (MP) of the Parliament of England for Cambridgeshire in March 1416.\nPassage 5:\nRobert Simpson (brewer)\nRobert Simpson was a Canadian brewer and politician who served as the first mayor of Barrie from 1871 to 1872, and again as its third mayor in 1876. He also founded the Simcoe Steam Brewery, and the 21st-century Robert Simpson Brewing Company (now The Flying Monkeys Craft Brewery) was named in his honour.\nPrior to becoming mayor, the head of the governing body for Barrie was known as the reeve of Barrie. Simpson first served as the fifth reeve from 1858 to 1859, and was succeeded by Thomas David McConkey. Simpson later succeeded the seventh and final reeve, William Davis Ardagh, in 1871, to become Barrie's first mayor.\nPassage 6:\nThomas Wykes (chronicler)\nThomas Wykes (11 March 1222 \u2013 c. 1292), English chronicler, was a canon regular of Oseney Abbey, near Oxford.He was the author of a chronicle extending from 1066 to 1289, which is printed among the monastic annals edited by Henry Richards Luard for the Rolls Series. He gives an account of the Second Barons' War from a royalist standpoint, and is a severe critic of Montfort's policy. His work regarding the reign of Edward I is especially useful. His chronicles are connected with the Oseney Annals, which are printed parallel with his work by Luard, but Wykes is an independent authority between 1258 and 1278.\nPassage 7:\nLambert of St-Bertin\nLambert of Saint-Bertin (c.\u20091060 \u2013 22 June 1125) was a French Benedictine chronicler and abbot.\n\nBiography\nLambert was born about 1060 of a distinguished family, and, when still young, entered the French Benedictine abbey of St-Bertin. He afterwards visited several famous schools in France, having first laid the foundation of his subsequent learning by the study in his own monastery of grammar, theology and music. For some time he filled the office of prior, and in 1095 was chosen abbot at once by the monks of St-Bertin and by the canons of St-Omer. He was thus drawn into closer relations with Cluny, and instituted through the Cluniac monks many reforms in his somewhat deteriorated monastery. Needless to say, he encountered no little opposition to his efforts, but, thanks to his extraordinary energy, he finally secured acceptance for his views, and rehabilitated the financial position of the monastery. He was a friend of St. Anselm and exchanged verses, still extant, with the poet Reginald of Canterbury (ed. Libermann in \"Neues Archiv der Gesellschaft fur altere Geschichte\", XIII, 1888, pp. 528; 531-34).  He died on 22 June 1125, at St-Bertin.\n\nWorks\nEven during his lifetime, Lambert was lauded in glowing terms for his great learning by an admirer \u2014not a monk of St-Bertin\u2014 in the \"Tractatus de moribus Lamberti Abbatis S. Beretini\" (ed. Holder-Egger in \"Monumenta German. Histor. SS.\", XV, 2, 946-53). This work mentions several otherwise unknown writings of Lambert, e.g. \"Sermones de Vetere Testamento\", also studies on free will, the Divine prescience, original sin, origin of the soul and questions of physical science.\nAlthough the two are often confused, he is not identical with Lambert, the Canon of St. Omer who wrote the famous \"Liber Floridus\", a kind of encyclopedia of Biblical, chronological, astronomical, geographical, theological, philosophical and natural history subjects, which was completed in 1120.\n\nSources and references\n Herbermann, Charles, ed.

Simpson was a Scottish professional golfer who achieved success in winning two Western Opens in 1907 and 1911, as well as finishing fourth in the U.S. Open in 1904. Simpson was from Carnoustie, Scotland. He apprenticed under Robert Simpson, a Scottish golf club-maker and golf course architect, who was also from Carnoustie and part of a famous golf family of six brothers. The two Simpsons however were not related. Bobby Simpson did apprentice in Scotland as a club-maker under the other Robert Simpson prior to leaving for the United States to become a golf professional.\n\nProfessional career\nSimpson was part of the \"Scottish Invasion\" of golf professional of the late 1890s and 1900s. He secured positions at multiple courses in the Midwest including The Country Club of Oconomowoc, Hinsdale Country Club (Chicago, Illinois), Kent Country Club (Grand Rapids, Michigan), Memphis Country Club (Memphis, Tennessee), Kenosha Country Club (Kenosha, Wisconsin), Blue Mound Country Club (Wauwatosa, Wisconsin), Omaha Country Club (Omaha, Nebraska) and many years at Riverside Country Club (Chicago, Illinois). Many of the early golf professionals from Scotland earned an income in various ways as greenskeepers, part-time course architects, club-makers, teaching professionals, tournament players and exhibition golf players. His most notable victories came with victories in the Western Open in 1907 and 1911.\n\n1900 U.S. Open\nAt the 1900 U.S. Open held at the Chicago Golf Club in Wheaton, Illinois, Simpson carded rounds of 84-84-88-87 for a total of 343 and tied for 14th place.\n\n1901 U.S. Open\nAt the 1901 U.S. Open held at the Myopia Hunt Club in South Hamilton, Massachusetts, Simpson carded rounds of 88-87-87-87 for a total of 349 and again tied for 14th place.\n\n1904 U.S. Open\nThe 1904 U.S. Open was held July 8\u20139, 1904, at the Glen View Club in Golf, Illinois. Scottish professional Willie Anderson won his second consecutive, and third overall, U.S. Open title by five strokes over Englishman, Gilbert Nicholls. Simpson carded rounds of 82-82-76-76 for a total of 316 and finished tied in sixth place with Stewart Gardner and Percy Barrett. He won $53 in prize money.\n\n1907 Western Open\nSimpson won the 1907 Western Open at the Hinsdale Country Club in Clarendon Hills, Illinois, where he defeated fellow Scotsmen, Willie Anderson and Fred McLeod, by two strokes, in Match Play.\n\n1908 Western Open\nAt the 1908 Western Open at the Beverly Country Club Simpson finished third (153) behind Willie Anderson (152) and Stewart Gardner (151), with the lowest round of the tournament (73).\n\n1909 U.S. Open\nAt the 1909 U.S. Open held at the Englewood Golf Club in Englewood, New Jersey, Simpson carded rounds of 84-76-77-84 for a total of 321 and tied for 46th place.\n\n1911 Western Open\nIn 1911 Simpson won his second Western Open at the Kent Country Club, in Grand Rapids, Michigan. He defeated Thomas McNamara, two up and one to play.\nPassage 10:\nRobert Simpson (meteorologist)\nRobert Homer Simpson (November 19, 1912 \u2013 December 18, 2014) was an American meteorologist, hurricane specialist, first director of the National Hurricane Research Project (NHRP) from 1955 to 1959, and a former director (1967\u20131974) of the National Hurricane Center (NHC). He was the co-developer of the Saffir\u2013Simpson Hurricane Scale with Herbert Saffir. His wife was Joanne Simpson.\n\nEarly life\nBorn in Corpus Christi, Texas, Robert Simpson survived the devastating landfall of the 1919 Florida Keys hurricane at age six; one of his family members drowned. Simpson graduated with honors from the Corpus Christi high school in 1929. Fascinated by the weather, he went on to get a Bachelor of Science degree in physics from Southwestern University in 1933, and a Master of Science degree in physics from Emory University in 1935. Finding no work as a physicist during the Great Depression, he taught music in Texas high schools.\n\nEarly career\nOn April 16, 1940, he was hired by the United States Weather Bureau. First assigned as a junior observer of meteorology at Brownsville, Texas, he was then temporarily assigned to Swan Island. After the Pearl Harbor attack, he was promoted to forecaster at the New Orleans office. As part of a United States Weather Bureau scholarship, he did graduate work at the University of Chicago in 1943 and 1944. After a stint as a hurricane forecaster in Miami under Grady Norton, he was assigned to help create the Army Air Force weather school in Panama. There he had his first flight into a tropical cyclone. After the war, he persuaded Air Force Hurricane Hunters to allow him to fly along on what he called 'piggy back missions', where he would take scientific observations using the primitive instruments.\nFollowing VJ day and the dissolution of the weather school, Simpson returned to Miami. He was then assigned to Weather Bureau headquarters, working directly for Dr. Francis Reichelderfer. In 1949 Reichelderfer assigned Simpson to Hawaii to be in charge of consolidating the Weather Bureau's Pacific operations. There he founded a weather observation station on Mauna Loa, studied Kona lows, and flew a research mission into Typhoon Marge aboard a specifically equipped Air Force weather plane. He continually urged Weather Bureau management to fund modest levels of hurricane research, but budgets during the early 1950s didn't allow this. Then the devastating 1954 Atlantic hurricane season changed the minds of several New England congressmen, and a special appropriation was passed to improve the Weather Bureau's hurricane warning system. Reichelderfer appointed Bob Simpson to head up the National Hurricane Research Project in 1955.\n\nLate career\nFor the next four years, Simpson navigated NHRP through the shoals of bureaucratic uncertainty. Once NHRP was assured longevity in 1959, Simpson left the Project to finish his doctorate in meteorology at the University of Chicago, studying under his friend Dr. Herbert Riehl. On completing his degree in 1962, he returned to Washington to become the Weather Bureau's Deputy Director of Research (Severe Storms), where he helped establish the National Severe Storms Project (later to become the National Severe Storms Laboratory). In 1961 he obtained a National Science Foundation grant to study seeding hurricanes with silver iodide. He put together an experiment using NHRP and United States Navy aircraft to seed Hurricane Esther. The encouraging results led the Weather Bureau and the Navy to start Project Stormfury in 1962, with Simpson as Director. He headed up the Project for the next three years, including the seeding of Hurricane Beulah in 1963. He married Joanne Malkus in 1965 and persuaded her to take over as Director of Stormfury for the next two years as he became Director of Operations for the Weather Bureau.In 1967 Simpson became Deputy Director of the National Hurricane Center. Simpson reorganized NHC, making it separate  from the Miami Weather Bureau office, and established the position of 'hurricane specialist' for NHC's senior forecasters. He directed NHC from 1968 to 1974, during which time he co-developed the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale (SSHS) with Herbert Saffir, established a dedicated satellite unit at NHC, studied neutercanes, and began issuing advisories on subtropical storms. His controversial remarks to Vice President Spiro Agnew in the wake of Hurricane Camille led to an upgrade of the Air Force and Navy Hurricane Hunter squadrons, and persuaded NOAA (then ESSA) to improve their hurricane research aircraft.\n\nRetirement\nHe retired from government service in 1974, turning NHC over to his Deputy Director Neil Frank. The Simpsons returned to Washington, where they established a weather consulting firm, Simpson Weather Associates in Charlottesville, Virginia. At this time he became a Certified Consulting Meteorologist.  Both he and his wife joined the faculty of the University of Virginia in the Environmental Sciences department.  In that capacity, he participated in several international scientific experiments, such as GATE, MONEX, ITEX, and Toga COARE. He co-authored the book \"The Hurricane and Its Impacts\" with Herbert Riehl, and recently was senior editor and contributing author to \"HURRICANE! Coping with Disaster.\"He was an Honorary Member of the American Meteorological Society (AMS) and a Fellow of the Explorers Club of New York. He is the recipient of Gold Medals from both the U.S. and from France, and of the Cleveland Abbe Award from the AMS. Simpson, whose wife died in 2010, resided in Washington, D.C. until his death after a stroke on December 18, 2014.\n\nBibliography\nRobert Simpson, \"Structure of an Immature Hurricane,\" Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society Vol. 35 No. 8 (October 1954): 335-350.\nRobert Simpson, \"Hurricanes,\" Scientific American (1954): 32-37.\nRobert Simpson, \"Liquid Water in Squall Lines and Hurricanes at air temperatures lower than -40\u00b0C,\" Mon.

The following year, he played a show during 10 months, directed by Franck Dubosc.\n\nCareer\nLemoine was a regular guest on On a tout essay\u00e9 on France 2 from 2001 to 2006, when he joined On n'est pas couch\u00e9 for two seasons.\nFrom 2011 until 2018, Lemoine was part of the slate of regular guests on Touche pas \u00e0 mon poste! on France 4 and then D8, when the talk show hosted by Cyril Hanouna switched channels in 2012. He also had a weekly segment called Les Questions en 4/3. In 2015, his segment became a TV special for one prime time.\nIn 2013, he joined Hanouna on his radio programme Les pieds dans le plat broadcast on Europe 1. From 2016 to 2017 and in 2017 respectively, he hosted the game shows Guess My Age and Couple or Not? on C8, both of which were created by Vivendi Entertainment and have spawned numerous international versions.\nLemoine quit C8 in 2018. He has hosted Samedi d'en rire on France 3 since 2019. He has also been a regular guest on Les Grosses T\u00eates since 2019.\nPassage 3:\nRobert Simpson (writer)\nRobert Simpson (1886 - January 7, 1934) was a writer and editor.\n\nEarly life\nIn 1886, Simpson was born in Strathy, Scotland. Simpson's father was Robert Simpson and his mother was Mary Ann Smith Simpson.\n\nCareer\nIn about 1905, Simpson started working in the palm-oil business, trading with West Africa.\nIn 1907, Simpson emigrated to the United States. In 1916, Simpson became an editor at the Frank A. Munsey Company.  In 1917, Simpson was promoted to managing editor of The Argosy, and stayed in that role for three years.  He left in 1920 to become a free-lance writer, and returned to editing in 1925, becoming the editor of Mystery Magazine.Simpson's novels include The Bite of Benin, Swamp Breath, The Grey Charteris, Eight Panes of Glass, and Calvert of Allobar.\n\nPersonal life\nSimpson was married to Marie A. Simpson, n\u00e9e Socin, and they had a daughter and two sons.\nPassage 4:\nThomas Wykes (MP for Cambridgeshire)\nThomas Wykes (died c. 1430), of Stetchworth, Cambridgeshire, was an English politician.\nHe was a Member (MP) of the Parliament of England for Cambridgeshire in March 1416.\nPassage 5:\nRobert Simpson (brewer)\nRobert Simpson was a Canadian brewer and politician who served as the first mayor of Barrie from 1871 to 1872, and again as its third mayor in 1876. He also founded the Simcoe Steam Brewery, and the 21st-century Robert Simpson Brewing Company (now The Flying Monkeys Craft Brewery) was named in his honour.\nPrior to becoming mayor, the head of the governing body for Barrie was known as the reeve of Barrie. Simpson first served as the fifth reeve from 1858 to 1859, and was succeeded by Thomas David McConkey. Simpson later succeeded the seventh and final reeve, William Davis Ardagh, in 1871, to become Barrie's first mayor.\nPassage 6:\nThomas Wykes (chronicler)\nThomas Wykes (11 March 1222 \u2013 c. 1292), English chronicler, was a canon regular of Oseney Abbey, near Oxford.He was the author of a chronicle extending from 1066 to 1289, which is printed among the monastic annals edited by Henry Richards Luard for the Rolls Series. He gives an account of the Second Barons' War from a royalist standpoint, and is a severe critic of Montfort's policy. His work regarding the reign of Edward I is especially useful. His chronicles are connected with the Oseney Annals, which are printed parallel with his work by Luard, but Wykes is an independent authority between 1258 and 1278.\nPassage 7:\nLambert of St-Bertin\nLambert of Saint-Bertin (c.\u20091060 \u2013 22 June 1125) was a French Benedictine chronicler and abbot.\n\nBiography\nLambert was born about 1060 of a distinguished family, and, when still young, entered the French Benedictine abbey of St-Bertin. He afterwards visited several famous schools in France, having first laid the foundation of his subsequent learning by the study in his own monastery of grammar, theology and music. For some time he filled the office of prior, and in 1095 was chosen abbot at once by the monks of St-Bertin and by the canons of St-Omer. He was thus drawn into closer relations with Cluny, and instituted through the Cluniac monks many reforms in his somewhat deteriorated monastery. Needless to say, he encountered no little opposition to his efforts, but, thanks to his extraordinary energy, he finally secured acceptance for his views, and rehabilitated the financial position of the monastery. He was a friend of St. Anselm and exchanged verses, still extant, with the poet Reginald of Canterbury (ed. Libermann in \"Neues Archiv der Gesellschaft fur altere Geschichte\", XIII, 1888, pp. 528; 531-34).  He died on 22 June 1125, at St-Bertin.\n\nWorks\nEven during his lifetime, Lambert was lauded in glowing terms for his great learning by an admirer \u2014not a monk of St-Bertin\u2014 in the \"Tractatus de moribus Lamberti Abbatis S. Beretini\" (ed. Holder-Egger in \"Monumenta German. Histor. SS.\", XV, 2, 946-53). This work mentions several otherwise unknown writings of Lambert, e.g. \"Sermones de Vetere Testamento\", also studies on free will, the Divine prescience, original sin, origin of the soul and questions of physical science.\nAlthough the two are often confused, he is not identical with Lambert, the Canon of St. Omer who wrote the famous \"Liber Floridus\", a kind of encyclopedia of Biblical, chronological, astronomical, geographical, theological, philosophical and natural history subjects, which was completed in 1120.\n\nSources and references\n Herbermann, Charles, ed.

Simpson was a Scottish professional golfer who achieved success in winning two Western Opens in 1907 and 1911, as well as finishing fourth in the U.S. Open in 1904. Simpson was from Carnoustie, Scotland. He apprenticed under Robert Simpson, a Scottish golf club-maker and golf course architect, who was also from Carnoustie and part of a famous golf family of six brothers. The two Simpsons however were not related. Bobby Simpson did apprentice in Scotland as a club-maker under the other Robert Simpson prior to leaving for the United States to become a golf professional.\n\nProfessional career\nSimpson was part of the \"Scottish Invasion\" of golf professional of the late 1890s and 1900s. He secured positions at multiple courses in the Midwest including The Country Club of Oconomowoc, Hinsdale Country Club (Chicago, Illinois), Kent Country Club (Grand Rapids, Michigan), Memphis Country Club (Memphis, Tennessee), Kenosha Country Club (Kenosha, Wisconsin), Blue Mound Country Club (Wauwatosa, Wisconsin), Omaha Country Club (Omaha, Nebraska) and many years at Riverside Country Club (Chicago, Illinois). Many of the early golf professionals from Scotland earned an income in various ways as greenskeepers, part-time course architects, club-makers, teaching professionals, tournament players and exhibition golf players. His most notable victories came with victories in the Western Open in 1907 and 1911.\n\n1900 U.S. Open\nAt the 1900 U.S. Open held at the Chicago Golf Club in Wheaton, Illinois, Simpson carded rounds of 84-84-88-87 for a total of 343 and tied for 14th place.\n\n1901 U.S. Open\nAt the 1901 U.S. Open held at the Myopia Hunt Club in South Hamilton, Massachusetts, Simpson carded rounds of 88-87-87-87 for a total of 349 and again tied for 14th place.\n\n1904 U.S. Open\nThe 1904 U.S. Open was held July 8\u20139, 1904, at the Glen View Club in Golf, Illinois. Scottish professional Willie Anderson won his second consecutive, and third overall, U.S. Open title by five strokes over Englishman, Gilbert Nicholls. Simpson carded rounds of 82-82-76-76 for a total of 316 and finished tied in sixth place with Stewart Gardner and Percy Barrett. He won $53 in prize money.\n\n1907 Western Open\nSimpson won the 1907 Western Open at the Hinsdale Country Club in Clarendon Hills, Illinois, where he defeated fellow Scotsmen, Willie Anderson and Fred McLeod, by two strokes, in Match Play.\n\n1908 Western Open\nAt the 1908 Western Open at the Beverly Country Club Simpson finished third (153) behind Willie Anderson (152) and Stewart Gardner (151), with the lowest round of the tournament (73).\n\n1909 U.S. Open\nAt the 1909 U.S. Open held at the Englewood Golf Club in Englewood, New Jersey, Simpson carded rounds of 84-76-77-84 for a total of 321 and tied for 46th place.\n\n1911 Western Open\nIn 1911 Simpson won his second Western Open at the Kent Country Club, in Grand Rapids, Michigan. He defeated Thomas McNamara, two up and one to play.\nPassage 10:\nRobert Simpson (meteorologist)\nRobert Homer Simpson (November 19, 1912 \u2013 December 18, 2014) was an American meteorologist, hurricane specialist, first director of the National Hurricane Research Project (NHRP) from 1955 to 1959, and a former director (1967\u20131974) of the National Hurricane Center (NHC). He was the co-developer of the Saffir\u2013Simpson Hurricane Scale with Herbert Saffir. His wife was Joanne Simpson.\n\nEarly life\nBorn in Corpus Christi, Texas, Robert Simpson survived the devastating landfall of the 1919 Florida Keys hurricane at age six; one of his family members drowned. Simpson graduated with honors from the Corpus Christi high school in 1929. Fascinated by the weather, he went on to get a Bachelor of Science degree in physics from Southwestern University in 1933, and a Master of Science degree in physics from Emory University in 1935. Finding no work as a physicist during the Great Depression, he taught music in Texas high schools.\n\nEarly career\nOn April 16, 1940, he was hired by the United States Weather Bureau. First assigned as a junior observer of meteorology at Brownsville, Texas, he was then temporarily assigned to Swan Island. After the Pearl Harbor attack, he was promoted to forecaster at the New Orleans office. As part of a United States Weather Bureau scholarship, he did graduate work at the University of Chicago in 1943 and 1944. After a stint as a hurricane forecaster in Miami under Grady Norton, he was assigned to help create the Army Air Force weather school in Panama. There he had his first flight into a tropical cyclone. After the war, he persuaded Air Force Hurricane Hunters to allow him to fly along on what he called 'piggy back missions', where he would take scientific observations using the primitive instruments.\nFollowing VJ day and the dissolution of the weather school, Simpson returned to Miami. He was then assigned to Weather Bureau headquarters, working directly for Dr. Francis Reichelderfer. In 1949 Reichelderfer assigned Simpson to Hawaii to be in charge of consolidating the Weather Bureau's Pacific operations. There he founded a weather observation station on Mauna Loa, studied Kona lows, and flew a research mission into Typhoon Marge aboard a specifically equipped Air Force weather plane. He continually urged Weather Bureau management to fund modest levels of hurricane research, but budgets during the early 1950s didn't allow this. Then the devastating 1954 Atlantic hurricane season changed the minds of several New England congressmen, and a special appropriation was passed to improve the Weather Bureau's hurricane warning system. Reichelderfer appointed Bob Simpson to head up the National Hurricane Research Project in 1955.\n\nLate career\nFor the next four years, Simpson navigated NHRP through the shoals of bureaucratic uncertainty. Once NHRP was assured longevity in 1959, Simpson left the Project to finish his doctorate in meteorology at the University of Chicago, studying under his friend Dr. Herbert Riehl. On completing his degree in 1962, he returned to Washington to become the Weather Bureau's Deputy Director of Research (Severe Storms), where he helped establish the National Severe Storms Project (later to become the National Severe Storms Laboratory). In 1961 he obtained a National Science Foundation grant to study seeding hurricanes with silver iodide. He put together an experiment using NHRP and United States Navy aircraft to seed Hurricane Esther. The encouraging results led the Weather Bureau and the Navy to start Project Stormfury in 1962, with Simpson as Director. He headed up the Project for the next three years, including the seeding of Hurricane Beulah in 1963. He married Joanne Malkus in 1965 and persuaded her to take over as Director of Stormfury for the next two years as he became Director of Operations for the Weather Bureau.In 1967 Simpson became Deputy Director of the National Hurricane Center. Simpson reorganized NHC, making it separate  from the Miami Weather Bureau office, and established the position of 'hurricane specialist' for NHC's senior forecasters. He directed NHC from 1968 to 1974, during which time he co-developed the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale (SSHS) with Herbert Saffir, established a dedicated satellite unit at NHC, studied neutercanes, and began issuing advisories on subtropical storms. His controversial remarks to Vice President Spiro Agnew in the wake of Hurricane Camille led to an upgrade of the Air Force and Navy Hurricane Hunter squadrons, and persuaded NOAA (then ESSA) to improve their hurricane research aircraft.\n\nRetirement\nHe retired from government service in 1974, turning NHC over to his Deputy Director Neil Frank. The Simpsons returned to Washington, where they established a weather consulting firm, Simpson Weather Associates in Charlottesville, Virginia. At this time he became a Certified Consulting Meteorologist.  Both he and his wife joined the faculty of the University of Virginia in the Environmental Sciences department.  In that capacity, he participated in several international scientific experiments, such as GATE, MONEX, ITEX, and Toga COARE. He co-authored the book \"The Hurricane and Its Impacts\" with Herbert Riehl, and recently was senior editor and contributing author to \"HURRICANE! Coping with Disaster.\"He was an Honorary Member of the American Meteorological Society (AMS) and a Fellow of the Explorers Club of New York. He is the recipient of Gold Medals from both the U.S. and from France, and of the Cleveland Abbe Award from the AMS. Simpson, whose wife died in 2010, resided in Washington, D.C. until his death after a stroke on December 18, 2014.\n\nBibliography\nRobert Simpson, \"Structure of an Immature Hurricane,\" Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society Vol. 35 No. 8 (October 1954): 335-350.\nRobert Simpson, \"Hurricanes,\" Scientific American (1954): 32-37.\nRobert Simpson, \"Liquid Water in Squall Lines and Hurricanes at air temperatures lower than -40\u00b0C,\" Mon.

The second son, Richard, rose to the rank of lieutenant-colonel, and served under Sir Eyre Coote against Hyder Ali Khan. The third son was Jonathan Scott the orientalist. The fourth son, Henry, became commissioner of police at Bombay.John, the eldest son, entered the service of the East India Company about 1766, and became a major in the Bengal division of its forces.\n\nIn India\nScott had been in India for twelve years before he knew Warren Hastings more than casually. They became close, and he was one of the intermediaries who, in November 1779, patched up a temporary reconciliation between Hastings and Philip Francis. In May 1780 he was appointed to command a battalion of sepoys.\n\nPolitical agent in London\nScott was sent by Hastings to England as his political agent, and he arrived in London on 17 December 1781. Scott was profuse in his expenditure for his patron.From 1784 to 1790 Scott sat in parliament as member for West Looe, and in 1790 he was returned for Stockbridge in Hampshire. A petition was presented against him, and in February 1793 a prosecution for bribery seemed imminent, but the matter fell through.\n\nImpeachment of Hastings\nThe charges against Warren Hastings might have been allowed to drop, but Scott reminded Edmund Burke on the first day of the session of 1786 of the notice which he had given before the preceding recess of bringing them before parliament. Scott asked Burke to name the first day that was practicable; Burke opened the subject on 17 February.

It also won best actor at the Hong Kong Film Awards for Eric Tsang, who would become a frequent collaborator with Chan.\nChan was a co-founder of United Filmmakers Organization (UFO) in the early 1990s, which produced a number of box-office and critical hits in Hong Kong, including his own: He Ain't Heavy, He's My Father.  Other critical and commercial successes followed, including Tom, Dick and Hairy, He's a Woman, She's a Man and Comrades, Almost a Love Story.\nIn the late 1990s, Chan worked in Hollywood, directing The Love Letter, which starred Kate Capshaw, Ellen DeGeneres and Tom Selleck.\nIn 2000, Chan co-founded Applause Pictures with Teddy Chen and Allan Fung.  The company's focus was on fostering ties with pan-Asian filmmakers, producing such films as Jan Dara by Thailand's Nonzee Nimibutr, One Fine Spring Day South Korea's Hur Jin-ho, Samsara by China's Huang Jianxin, The Eye by Danny and Oxide Pang and cinematographer Christopher Doyle.\nChan's 2005 film, the musical Perhaps Love closed the 2005 Venice Film Festival and was Hong Kong's entry for an Academy Awards nomination in the best foreign film category.  Perhaps Love became one of the year's top-grossing films in China, Hong Kong and Taiwan, and received a record 29 awards. Chan next directed The Warlords (2007) and produced Derek Yee's Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 (2007). The two films were the two highest grossing Hong Kong-China co-productions of 2007.

He went to England at the end of World War II as a member of the Royal Air Force, and settled in Kidderminster in Worcestershire in 1947, where he worked as a civilian lorry driver for the RAF. He began playing for Kidderminster Cricket Club in the Birmingham League, and at the start of the 1952 season, opening the bowling for the club's senior team, he had figures of 7 for 9 and 7 for 37.Worcestershire invited him to play for them, and he made his first-class debut against Sussex in July 1952. He took five wickets in the match (his maiden victim being Ken Suttle) and then held on for 4 not out with Peter Richardson (20 not out) to add the 12 runs needed for a one-wicket victory after his county had collapsed from 192 for 2 to 238 for 9. A week later he claimed four wickets against Warwickshire, then a few days later still he managed 6 for 52 (five of his victims bowled) in what was otherwise a disastrous innings defeat to Derbyshire. In the last match of the season he took a career-best 6 for 51 against Glamorgan; he and Reg Perks (4 for 59) bowled unchanged throughout the first innings. Worcestershire won the game and Lobban finished the season with 23 wickets at 23.69.He took 23 wickets again in 1953, but at a considerably worse average of 34.43, and had only two really successful games: against Oxford University in June, when he took 5 for 70, and then against Sussex in July. On this occasion Lobban claimed eight wickets, his most in a match, including 6 for 103 in the first innings. He also made his highest score with the bat, 18, but Sussex won by five wickets.In 1954 Lobban made only two first-class appearances, and managed only the single wicket of Gloucestershire tail-ender Bomber Wells. In his final game, against Warwickshire at Dudley, his nine first-innings overs cost 51. He bowled just two overs in the second innings as Warwickshire completed an easy ten-wicket win. Lobban played one more Second XI game, against Glamorgan II at Cardiff Arms Park; in this he picked up five wickets.\nHe was also a professional boxer and played rugby union for Kidderminster.He later moved to Canada, where he worked as a teacher in Burnaby, British Columbia. He and his wife Celia had a son and two daughters.\nPassage 8:\nHenry Moore (cricketer)\nHenry Walter Moore (1849 \u2013 20 August 1916) was an English-born first-class cricketer who spent most of his life in New Zealand.\n\nLife and family\nHenry Moore was born in Cranbrook, Kent, in 1849. He was the son of the Reverend Edward Moore and Lady Harriet Janet Sarah Montagu-Scott, who was one of the daughters of the 4th Duke of Buccleuch. One of his brothers, Arthur, became an admiral and was knighted. Their great \ngrandfather was John Moore, Archbishop of Canterbury from 1783 to 1805. One of their sisters was a maid of honour to Queen Victoria.Moore went to New Zealand in the 1870s and lived in Geraldine and Christchurch. He married Henrietta Lysaght of H\u0101wera in November 1879, and they had one son. In May 1884 she died a few days after giving birth to a daughter, who also died.In 1886 Moore became a Justice of the Peace in Geraldine. In 1897 he married Alice Fish of Geraldine. They moved to England four years before his death in 1916.\n\nCricket career\nMoore was a right-handed middle-order batsman. In consecutive seasons, 1876\u201377 and 1877\u201378, playing for Canterbury, he made the highest score in the short New Zealand first-class season: 76 and 75 respectively. His 76 came in his first match for Canterbury, against Otago. He went to the wicket early on the first day with the score at 7 for 2 and put on 99 for the third wicket with Charles Corfe before he was out with the score at 106 for 3 after a \"very fine exhibition of free hitting, combined with good defence\". Canterbury were all out for 133, but went on to win the match. His 75 came in the next season's match against Otago, when he took the score from 22 for 2 to 136 for 6. The New Zealand cricket historian Tom Reese said, \"Right from the beginning he smote the bowling hip and thigh, going out of his ground to indulge in some forceful driving.\" Canterbury won again.Moore led the batting averages in the Canterbury Cricket Association in 1877\u201378 with 379 runs at an average of 34.4. Also in 1877\u201378, he was a member of the Canterbury team that inflicted the only defeat on the touring Australians. In 1896\u201397, at the age of 47, he top-scored in each innings for a South Canterbury XVIII against the touring Queensland cricket team.\nPassage 9:\nOur Crazy Nieces\nOur Crazy Nieces (German: Unsere tollen Nichten) is a 1963 Austrian comedy film directed by Rolf Olsen and starring Gunther Philipp, Vivi Bach, and Paul H\u00f6rbiger.

She is the first woman to ever hold the position. In 2007, after a 22-year career in the British Army, Cameron became one of the 35 resident Warders in the Tower of London, commonly known as the Beefeaters.\nOriginally prison guards, the Yeoman Warder's position dates back to 1485. It is now a largely ceremonial role, with responsibility for conducting guided tours and generally looking after public visitors to the Tower, as well as conducting certain other duties both inside and outside the Tower.\n\nCareer\nBritish Army\nCameron joined the Women's Royal Army Corps (WRAC) in June 1985 at the age of 20. She was trained as a Data Telegraphist with the Royal Corps of Signals before transferring to the Royal Army Pay Corps (RAPC) in 1988 to train as a Military Accountant, and in 2000 Cameron was awarded her Long Service and Good Conduct Medal. In 1992, WRAC and RAPC were replaced by the Adjutant General's Corps, and Cameron worked her way through the ranks in its Staff and Personnel Support Branch, completing 22 years service in the army in June 2007. Having seen service in England, Northern Ireland and Cyprus, Cameron ended her Army career at the rank of Warrant Officer Class 2, holding the post of Superintendent Clerk in 145 (Home Counties) Brigade in Aldershot.\n\nYeoman Warder\nCameron officially became the first ever female Yeoman Warder in July 2007 but didn't get to wear her uniform until 3 September 2007. Cameron is one of 37 Yeoman Warders based in the Tower of London, a position which dates back to 1485. Styled as Yeoman Warder Cameron, her full and proper title is Yeoman Warder of His Majesty's Royal Palace and Fortress the Tower of London, and Members of the Sovereign's Body Guard of the Yeoman Guard in the Extraordinary.Camerons' duties are mostly connected to the Tower, but can involve some outside ceremonies. Within the Tower, Cameron's role is to take care of public visitors to the Tower and perform guided tours, guard the Crown Jewels, perform the Ceremony of the Keys and look after the Ravens of the Tower. Outside the Tower, Warders duties are to attend the Coronation of the Sovereign, lying-in-state, the Lord Mayor's Show, and other state and charity functions. As a Yeoman Warder, Cameron has two tailored-to-fit uniforms, the Scarlet ceremonial dress, and the 'undress' blue uniform for day-to-day duties (each in three variants of varying thickness for different seasons).On 25 November 2009, two Yeoman Warders were dismissed after being found guilty of gross misconduct for bullying Cameron due to her gender. Three Warders had been suspended, and one was subsequently re-instated following the month-long investigation, with his role 'unproven'. One of the three also received a police caution for defacing Cameron's Wikipedia biography.Cameron retired in Autumn 2022 after having served 15 years as a Yeoman Warder.\n\nFirst female Yeoman Warder\nThe post of Yeoman Warder had never specifically been barred to women, although due to the rules governing women in the British Army, it was only in the modern era that women were able to have a career able to meet the entry requirements. To apply for the job, applicants had to be aged between 40 and 55, have completed at least 22 years' service in either the Army, Royal Air Force or Royal Marines reaching the rank of Warrant Officer or Senior Non-Commissioned Officer (NCO), and have been awarded the Long Service and Good Conduct Medal. It was announced on 3 January 2007 that an unnamed female would be replacing a retiring Yeoman Warder in September 2007, with WO2 Cameron, still in the Army at the time, publicly named as this replacement eight days later. Cameron had long been interested in the job of Yeoman Warder, and applied to an advertisement placed in Soldier Magazine in Summer 2006. Cameron was not the first woman to apply for the job of Yeoman Warder, but she was the first to pass the interview process, beating five male candidates for the vacancy.\n\nPersonal life\nBorn in 1964, Cameron grew up in Furnace, Argyll on the west coast of Scotland, and joined the Army at the suggestion of her mother, who thought she 'needed to see the world'. As part of her job as a Yeoman Warder, she lives in the Tower of London in a subsidised apartment. In February 2011, Cameron was made a patron of The Kit Wilson Trust for Animal Welfare, an animal welfare charity based in East Sussex.\n\nSee also\nTourism in London\nWomen in the military\nPassage 6:\nTower of London (disambiguation)\nThe Tower of London is a former Royal residence in London.\nTower(s) of London may also refer to:\n\nGeography\nTower of London Range, Northern Rockies, Canada\nLondon Tower (Alaska), a mountain in Denali National Park\n\nArts, media, and entertainment\nFilms\nTower of London (1939 film)\n Peter Pan (1953 film) as an animated model of the building\nTower of London (1962 film)\nMary Poppins (1964 film) as Peter Ellenshaw's Cloudy London set\nCarry On Henry seen in the opening credits and the closing titles\n\nLiterature\nThe Tower of London (novel), a 19th-century novel by William Harrison Ainsworth\nThe Tower of London (Soseki novel), a short story by Natsume Soseki\n\nMusic\nTowers of London (band)\n\"Towers of London\" (song)\n\"Tower of London\", a song by ABC from the album How to Be a ...

It was written by Agnes Christine Johnston and Max Marcin, based upon Selma Lagerl\u00f6f's 1914 novel The Emperor of Portugallia (MGM actually purchased the story rights in 1922). The film was supposed to be called The Emperor of Portugallia, but was later changed to The Tower of Lies.\nReleased one year after He Who Gets Slapped, the film marks the second collaboration between Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m, Lon Chaney and Norma Shearer. Also starring are William Haines, Ian Keith and Lew Cody.The film's sets were designed by the art director James Basevi and Cedric Gibbons. The film was shot on location in the Sacramento River Delta, Lake Arrowhead and the Laurel Canyon area of Los Angeles. It took 53 days to complete at a cost of $185,000. It grossed $653,000 worldwide.\n\"Film Mercury\" voted Chaney's performance as one of the year's best. It is considered a lost film, although rumors persist that a print may exist in Denmark. Stills exist showing Chaney in his \"Jan\" makeup, which took him three hours each day to apply.\n\nPlot\nJan (Lon Chaney) is a Swedish farmer and Glory (Norma Shearer) is his beloved daughter. When she was a child, she and her father used to role-play being the Emperor and Empress of Portugallia, a fairy tale land where dreams come true, and a neighboring farm boy named August would play the Prince. Glory grows up to be a beautiful young woman, and both August and Jan's vile landlord Lars (Iam Keith) vie for her attention.\nJan incurs some debts he cannot pay, and to save him from bankruptcy, his daughter temporarily moves to the big city supposedly to get a job (finally allowing Lars to lead her into prostitution). After a time, the landlord tells Jan his daughter has succeeded in paying off his debts, but will not tell him how she earned the money. Realizing that his daughter has been selling herself to help him avoid bankruptcy, Jan's mind slowly begins to unravel. Years pass and his daughter never returns to the farm, and every day Jan waits down by the riverboat hoping she will come home.\nEventually she does return to him, but by this time, Jan's mind has snapped and he actually believes that he is the Emperor of Portugallia and she is his Empress. Jan has taken to wearing a strange military uniform and a circus hat, and his hair and long beard have all turned gray (see photo). Glory's fine attire leads the villagers to believe that she has been living as a prostitute and they demand she leave town. Only August is willing to stand by her and protect her honor.\nGlory boards the local steamboat at the docks in order to leave town, and her father follows her, falling off the pier in his haste and drowning. When the ship's captain throws the boat into reverse in an attempt to save Jan, Lars (who is taunting Glory from the ship's deck) is thrown into the paddlewheel and crushed to death. Glory winds up marrying August and settling down in town with him.\n\nCast\nCritical Comments\n\"Notwithstanding that TOWER OF LIES is a sincerely made picture and excellent from the artistic and literary viewpoints, it is too heavy for the picture audiences. When finished the impression left is that one more prostitute has reformed and been forgiven...The acting is aces and the direction masterful. But with all this, TOWER OF LIES can never be anything more than a soggy picture made bearable by the leavening forces of Seastrom, Chaney and Shearer.\" ---Variety\n\"THE TOWER OF LIES is a beautiful production with a flash of poignant drama at its end...Chaney and Miss Shearer especially are splendid.\" ---Moving Picture World\n\"It seems as if Mr. Chaney had had too much to say about his own performance, for he overacts and his make-up, consisting largely of a rich crop of iron gray hair and whiskers and beard, seem to fit well without looking as if they belonged to him. Mr. Chaney's exaggerated actions and expressions appear to have been contagious, for Mr. Seastrom himself betrays a weakness for overemphasizing a number of points.\" ---The New York Times\"A distinctive and rare artistic achievement... A very worthy effort and yet probably not the best box office. Chaney passes by his usual grotesque characterization and does something just a bit different.\" ---Film Daily\n\"(Chaney) does not resort to the grotesque, but from the first sequences, where he appears as the tiller of the soil who neither loves nor hates....to the last when he becomes a demented old man, his interpretation is pathetically convincing.\" --- Movie Magazine\n\"Mr. Chaney's performance struck me as being a notable one. Toward the close of the film, Chaney is far more than a mere artificer. He really is Jan, the gnarled, mad old peasant.\" ---New York Tribune\"Though Mr. Seastrom's direction and the acting of the players are masterful, the theme is not very pleasant. Some picture-goers may like this picture very well, while others will not. Mr. Chaney does excellent work and awakens warm sympathy in a role that is the exact opposite in nature to thse he has been given in pictures lately.\" ----Harrison's Reports\n\nPreservation\nThe Tower of Lies is now considered a lost film. The last known surviving copy of the film was reportedly destroyed in the 1965 MGM vault fire.\n\nSee also\nList of lost films\nPassage 8:\nVictor Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m\nVictor David Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m (Swedish: [\u02c8v\u026a\u030ck\u02d0t\u0254r \u02c8\u0267\u00f8\u0302\u02d0str\u0153m] (listen); 20 September 1879 \u2013 3 January 1960), also known in the United States as Victor Seastrom, was a pioneering Swedish film director, screenwriter, and actor. He began his career in Sweden, before moving to Hollywood in 1924. Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m worked primarily in the silent era; his best known films include The Phantom Carriage (1921), He Who Gets Slapped (1924), and The Wind (1928). Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m was Sweden's most prominent director in the \"Golden Age of Silent Film\" in Europe. Later in life, he played the leading role in Ingmar Bergman's Wild Strawberries (1957).\n\nBiography\nBorn in \u00c5rj\u00e4ng/Silbodal, in the V\u00e4rmland region of Sweden, he was only a year old when his father, Olof Adolf Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m, moved the family to Brooklyn, New York. His mother died in 1886, he was seven years old. Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m returned to Sweden where he lived with relatives in Stockholm, beginning his acting career at 17 as a member of a touring theater company.\nDrawn from the stage to the fledgling motion picture industry, he made his first film in 1912 under the direction of Mauritz Stiller. Between 1912 and 1923, he directed another forty-one films in Sweden, some of which are now lost. Those surviving include The Sons of Ingmar (1919), Karin, Daughter of Ingmar (1920) and The Phantom Carriage (1921), all based on stories by the Nobel Prize\u2013winning novelist Selma Lagerl\u00f6f. Many of his films from the period are marked by subtle character portrayal, fine storytelling and evocative settings in which the Swedish landscape often plays a key psychological role. The naturalistic quality of his films was enhanced by his (then revolutionary) preference for on-location filming, especially in rural and village settings. He is also known as a pioneer of continuity editing in narrative filmmaking.In 1923, Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m accepted an offer from Louis B. Mayer to work in the United States. In Sweden, he had acted in his own films as well as in those for others, but in Hollywood he devoted himself solely to directing. Using an anglicized name, Victor Seastrom, he made the drama film Name the Man (1924) based on the Hall Caine novel, The Master of Man. He directed stars of the day such as Greta Garbo, John Gilbert, Lillian Gish, Lon Chaney, and Norma Shearer in another eight films in America before his first talkie in 1930. His 1926 film The Scarlet Letter, starring Lillian Gish as the adulterous Hester Prynne, allows Hester a certain voluptuousness; when she leaves the bare rooms of the town for a date with her lover in the verdant woods, she defiantly pulls off her scarlet letter A, takes off her cap as well, and we see her beautiful, rich head of hair.\nUncomfortable with the modifications needed to direct sound films, Victor Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m returned to Sweden where he directed two more films before his final directing effort, an English-language drama filmed in the United Kingdom Under the Red Robe (1937). Over the following fifteen years, Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m returned to acting in the theatre, performed a variety of leading roles in more than a dozen films and was a company director of Svensk Film Industri. Aged 78, he gave his final acting performance, probably his best remembered, as the elderly professor Isak Borg in Ingmar Bergman's film Wild Strawberries (1957).\n\nPersonal life\nSj\u00f6str\u00f6m was married three times. His daughter was actress Guje Lagerwall (1918-2019).\nVictor Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m died in Stockholm at the age of 80, and he was interred in the Norra begravningsplatsen (Northern cemetery).\n\nFilmography\nDirector\nActor\nPassage 9:\nThe Tower of Silence (film)\nThe Tower of Silence (German: Der Turm des Schweigens) is a 1925 German mystic melodrama directed by Johannes Guter and starring Xenia Desni and Nigel Barrie. The Tower of Silence is a silent film, and one of the few films by Guter to survive. In 2007, it became the director's first film to be restored for modern audiences.\n\nPlot\nThe Tower of Silence centres around Eva (Xenia Desni), a beautiful woman kept in a high tower by her grieving widowed father. When an attractive explorer, Arved (Nigel Barrie), is saved by Eva after crashing his car near the tower, he introduces her into high society. When Arved, who was previously believed to be dead, discovers that he has lost his fianc\u00e9e to ex-partner and aviator Wilfred, he must decide whether to reveal a secret that will destroy his old friend.\n\nCast\nXenia Desni as Eva\nNigel Barrie as Arved Holl\nFritz Delius as Wilfred Durian\nAvrom Morewski (Abraham Morewski) as Eldor Vartalun\nGustav Oberg as Ceel\nHanna Ralph as Liane\nHermann Leffler as Mac Farland\nPhilipp Manning as Werner Neuwitt\nJenny Jugo as Evi\nPassage 10:\nBed of Lies\n\"Bed of Lies\" is a song by Trinidadian-American rapper and singer Nicki Minaj, taken from her third studio album, The Pinkprint (2014). The song was first premiered at the 2014 MTV EMAs in Glasgow, Scotland and was later released on November 16, 2014, by Young Money Entertainment, Cash Money Records and Republic Records as the fourth single from the album. The track features American singer-songwriter Skylar Grey on the chorus plus additional vocals on the verses as well as piano playing and was written by the latter along with Minaj. \"Bed of Lies\" features a restrained keyboard and lyrics that touch upon themes of \"heartfelt litany of grievances\" about an ex-lover.The song peaked at number 62 on the US Billboard Hot 100 and became Minaj's 56th Hot 100 entry, tying her with Madonna and Dionne Warwick for the third-most entries among women. It peaked at number seven in Australia and number 13 in New Zealand. \"Bed of Lies\" was certified platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association and gold by Recorded Music NZ.\n\nBackground\nMinaj debuted the song at the 2014 MTV EMAs in Glasgow, Scotland with Skylar Grey. In an interview with Billboard, Grey revealed that she had written and recorded a demo version of the track before it had been sent to Minaj who wrote and recorded verses of her own to the song. Grey commented, \"She liked the demo of it enough to keep me on the song. I knew it was maybe gonna happen, but she released a lot of different singles first.

She is the first woman to ever hold the position. In 2007, after a 22-year career in the British Army, Cameron became one of the 35 resident Warders in the Tower of London, commonly known as the Beefeaters.\nOriginally prison guards, the Yeoman Warder's position dates back to 1485. It is now a largely ceremonial role, with responsibility for conducting guided tours and generally looking after public visitors to the Tower, as well as conducting certain other duties both inside and outside the Tower.\n\nCareer\nBritish Army\nCameron joined the Women's Royal Army Corps (WRAC) in June 1985 at the age of 20. She was trained as a Data Telegraphist with the Royal Corps of Signals before transferring to the Royal Army Pay Corps (RAPC) in 1988 to train as a Military Accountant, and in 2000 Cameron was awarded her Long Service and Good Conduct Medal. In 1992, WRAC and RAPC were replaced by the Adjutant General's Corps, and Cameron worked her way through the ranks in its Staff and Personnel Support Branch, completing 22 years service in the army in June 2007. Having seen service in England, Northern Ireland and Cyprus, Cameron ended her Army career at the rank of Warrant Officer Class 2, holding the post of Superintendent Clerk in 145 (Home Counties) Brigade in Aldershot.\n\nYeoman Warder\nCameron officially became the first ever female Yeoman Warder in July 2007 but didn't get to wear her uniform until 3 September 2007. Cameron is one of 37 Yeoman Warders based in the Tower of London, a position which dates back to 1485. Styled as Yeoman Warder Cameron, her full and proper title is Yeoman Warder of His Majesty's Royal Palace and Fortress the Tower of London, and Members of the Sovereign's Body Guard of the Yeoman Guard in the Extraordinary.Camerons' duties are mostly connected to the Tower, but can involve some outside ceremonies. Within the Tower, Cameron's role is to take care of public visitors to the Tower and perform guided tours, guard the Crown Jewels, perform the Ceremony of the Keys and look after the Ravens of the Tower. Outside the Tower, Warders duties are to attend the Coronation of the Sovereign, lying-in-state, the Lord Mayor's Show, and other state and charity functions. As a Yeoman Warder, Cameron has two tailored-to-fit uniforms, the Scarlet ceremonial dress, and the 'undress' blue uniform for day-to-day duties (each in three variants of varying thickness for different seasons).On 25 November 2009, two Yeoman Warders were dismissed after being found guilty of gross misconduct for bullying Cameron due to her gender. Three Warders had been suspended, and one was subsequently re-instated following the month-long investigation, with his role 'unproven'. One of the three also received a police caution for defacing Cameron's Wikipedia biography.Cameron retired in Autumn 2022 after having served 15 years as a Yeoman Warder.\n\nFirst female Yeoman Warder\nThe post of Yeoman Warder had never specifically been barred to women, although due to the rules governing women in the British Army, it was only in the modern era that women were able to have a career able to meet the entry requirements. To apply for the job, applicants had to be aged between 40 and 55, have completed at least 22 years' service in either the Army, Royal Air Force or Royal Marines reaching the rank of Warrant Officer or Senior Non-Commissioned Officer (NCO), and have been awarded the Long Service and Good Conduct Medal. It was announced on 3 January 2007 that an unnamed female would be replacing a retiring Yeoman Warder in September 2007, with WO2 Cameron, still in the Army at the time, publicly named as this replacement eight days later. Cameron had long been interested in the job of Yeoman Warder, and applied to an advertisement placed in Soldier Magazine in Summer 2006. Cameron was not the first woman to apply for the job of Yeoman Warder, but she was the first to pass the interview process, beating five male candidates for the vacancy.\n\nPersonal life\nBorn in 1964, Cameron grew up in Furnace, Argyll on the west coast of Scotland, and joined the Army at the suggestion of her mother, who thought she 'needed to see the world'. As part of her job as a Yeoman Warder, she lives in the Tower of London in a subsidised apartment. In February 2011, Cameron was made a patron of The Kit Wilson Trust for Animal Welfare, an animal welfare charity based in East Sussex.\n\nSee also\nTourism in London\nWomen in the military\nPassage 6:\nTower of London (disambiguation)\nThe Tower of London is a former Royal residence in London.\nTower(s) of London may also refer to:\n\nGeography\nTower of London Range, Northern Rockies, Canada\nLondon Tower (Alaska), a mountain in Denali National Park\n\nArts, media, and entertainment\nFilms\nTower of London (1939 film)\n Peter Pan (1953 film) as an animated model of the building\nTower of London (1962 film)\nMary Poppins (1964 film) as Peter Ellenshaw's Cloudy London set\nCarry On Henry seen in the opening credits and the closing titles\n\nLiterature\nThe Tower of London (novel), a 19th-century novel by William Harrison Ainsworth\nThe Tower of London (Soseki novel), a short story by Natsume Soseki\n\nMusic\nTowers of London (band)\n\"Towers of London\" (song)\n\"Tower of London\", a song by ABC from the album How to Be a ...

It was written by Agnes Christine Johnston and Max Marcin, based upon Selma Lagerl\u00f6f's 1914 novel The Emperor of Portugallia (MGM actually purchased the story rights in 1922). The film was supposed to be called The Emperor of Portugallia, but was later changed to The Tower of Lies.\nReleased one year after He Who Gets Slapped, the film marks the second collaboration between Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m, Lon Chaney and Norma Shearer. Also starring are William Haines, Ian Keith and Lew Cody.The film's sets were designed by the art director James Basevi and Cedric Gibbons. The film was shot on location in the Sacramento River Delta, Lake Arrowhead and the Laurel Canyon area of Los Angeles. It took 53 days to complete at a cost of $185,000. It grossed $653,000 worldwide.\n\"Film Mercury\" voted Chaney's performance as one of the year's best. It is considered a lost film, although rumors persist that a print may exist in Denmark. Stills exist showing Chaney in his \"Jan\" makeup, which took him three hours each day to apply.\n\nPlot\nJan (Lon Chaney) is a Swedish farmer and Glory (Norma Shearer) is his beloved daughter. When she was a child, she and her father used to role-play being the Emperor and Empress of Portugallia, a fairy tale land where dreams come true, and a neighboring farm boy named August would play the Prince. Glory grows up to be a beautiful young woman, and both August and Jan's vile landlord Lars (Iam Keith) vie for her attention.\nJan incurs some debts he cannot pay, and to save him from bankruptcy, his daughter temporarily moves to the big city supposedly to get a job (finally allowing Lars to lead her into prostitution). After a time, the landlord tells Jan his daughter has succeeded in paying off his debts, but will not tell him how she earned the money. Realizing that his daughter has been selling herself to help him avoid bankruptcy, Jan's mind slowly begins to unravel. Years pass and his daughter never returns to the farm, and every day Jan waits down by the riverboat hoping she will come home.\nEventually she does return to him, but by this time, Jan's mind has snapped and he actually believes that he is the Emperor of Portugallia and she is his Empress. Jan has taken to wearing a strange military uniform and a circus hat, and his hair and long beard have all turned gray (see photo). Glory's fine attire leads the villagers to believe that she has been living as a prostitute and they demand she leave town. Only August is willing to stand by her and protect her honor.\nGlory boards the local steamboat at the docks in order to leave town, and her father follows her, falling off the pier in his haste and drowning. When the ship's captain throws the boat into reverse in an attempt to save Jan, Lars (who is taunting Glory from the ship's deck) is thrown into the paddlewheel and crushed to death. Glory winds up marrying August and settling down in town with him.\n\nCast\nCritical Comments\n\"Notwithstanding that TOWER OF LIES is a sincerely made picture and excellent from the artistic and literary viewpoints, it is too heavy for the picture audiences. When finished the impression left is that one more prostitute has reformed and been forgiven...The acting is aces and the direction masterful. But with all this, TOWER OF LIES can never be anything more than a soggy picture made bearable by the leavening forces of Seastrom, Chaney and Shearer.\" ---Variety\n\"THE TOWER OF LIES is a beautiful production with a flash of poignant drama at its end...Chaney and Miss Shearer especially are splendid.\" ---Moving Picture World\n\"It seems as if Mr. Chaney had had too much to say about his own performance, for he overacts and his make-up, consisting largely of a rich crop of iron gray hair and whiskers and beard, seem to fit well without looking as if they belonged to him. Mr. Chaney's exaggerated actions and expressions appear to have been contagious, for Mr. Seastrom himself betrays a weakness for overemphasizing a number of points.\" ---The New York Times\"A distinctive and rare artistic achievement... A very worthy effort and yet probably not the best box office. Chaney passes by his usual grotesque characterization and does something just a bit different.\" ---Film Daily\n\"(Chaney) does not resort to the grotesque, but from the first sequences, where he appears as the tiller of the soil who neither loves nor hates....to the last when he becomes a demented old man, his interpretation is pathetically convincing.\" --- Movie Magazine\n\"Mr. Chaney's performance struck me as being a notable one. Toward the close of the film, Chaney is far more than a mere artificer. He really is Jan, the gnarled, mad old peasant.\" ---New York Tribune\"Though Mr. Seastrom's direction and the acting of the players are masterful, the theme is not very pleasant. Some picture-goers may like this picture very well, while others will not. Mr. Chaney does excellent work and awakens warm sympathy in a role that is the exact opposite in nature to thse he has been given in pictures lately.\" ----Harrison's Reports\n\nPreservation\nThe Tower of Lies is now considered a lost film. The last known surviving copy of the film was reportedly destroyed in the 1965 MGM vault fire.\n\nSee also\nList of lost films\nPassage 8:\nVictor Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m\nVictor David Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m (Swedish: [\u02c8v\u026a\u030ck\u02d0t\u0254r \u02c8\u0267\u00f8\u0302\u02d0str\u0153m] (listen); 20 September 1879 \u2013 3 January 1960), also known in the United States as Victor Seastrom, was a pioneering Swedish film director, screenwriter, and actor. He began his career in Sweden, before moving to Hollywood in 1924. Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m worked primarily in the silent era; his best known films include The Phantom Carriage (1921), He Who Gets Slapped (1924), and The Wind (1928). Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m was Sweden's most prominent director in the \"Golden Age of Silent Film\" in Europe. Later in life, he played the leading role in Ingmar Bergman's Wild Strawberries (1957).\n\nBiography\nBorn in \u00c5rj\u00e4ng/Silbodal, in the V\u00e4rmland region of Sweden, he was only a year old when his father, Olof Adolf Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m, moved the family to Brooklyn, New York. His mother died in 1886, he was seven years old. Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m returned to Sweden where he lived with relatives in Stockholm, beginning his acting career at 17 as a member of a touring theater company.\nDrawn from the stage to the fledgling motion picture industry, he made his first film in 1912 under the direction of Mauritz Stiller. Between 1912 and 1923, he directed another forty-one films in Sweden, some of which are now lost. Those surviving include The Sons of Ingmar (1919), Karin, Daughter of Ingmar (1920) and The Phantom Carriage (1921), all based on stories by the Nobel Prize\u2013winning novelist Selma Lagerl\u00f6f. Many of his films from the period are marked by subtle character portrayal, fine storytelling and evocative settings in which the Swedish landscape often plays a key psychological role. The naturalistic quality of his films was enhanced by his (then revolutionary) preference for on-location filming, especially in rural and village settings. He is also known as a pioneer of continuity editing in narrative filmmaking.In 1923, Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m accepted an offer from Louis B. Mayer to work in the United States. In Sweden, he had acted in his own films as well as in those for others, but in Hollywood he devoted himself solely to directing. Using an anglicized name, Victor Seastrom, he made the drama film Name the Man (1924) based on the Hall Caine novel, The Master of Man. He directed stars of the day such as Greta Garbo, John Gilbert, Lillian Gish, Lon Chaney, and Norma Shearer in another eight films in America before his first talkie in 1930. His 1926 film The Scarlet Letter, starring Lillian Gish as the adulterous Hester Prynne, allows Hester a certain voluptuousness; when she leaves the bare rooms of the town for a date with her lover in the verdant woods, she defiantly pulls off her scarlet letter A, takes off her cap as well, and we see her beautiful, rich head of hair.\nUncomfortable with the modifications needed to direct sound films, Victor Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m returned to Sweden where he directed two more films before his final directing effort, an English-language drama filmed in the United Kingdom Under the Red Robe (1937). Over the following fifteen years, Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m returned to acting in the theatre, performed a variety of leading roles in more than a dozen films and was a company director of Svensk Film Industri. Aged 78, he gave his final acting performance, probably his best remembered, as the elderly professor Isak Borg in Ingmar Bergman's film Wild Strawberries (1957).\n\nPersonal life\nSj\u00f6str\u00f6m was married three times. His daughter was actress Guje Lagerwall (1918-2019).\nVictor Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m died in Stockholm at the age of 80, and he was interred in the Norra begravningsplatsen (Northern cemetery).\n\nFilmography\nDirector\nActor\nPassage 9:\nThe Tower of Silence (film)\nThe Tower of Silence (German: Der Turm des Schweigens) is a 1925 German mystic melodrama directed by Johannes Guter and starring Xenia Desni and Nigel Barrie.

Union Colonel Jeb Britton (Bennett), Vance's brother, is sent West to stop the Confederate raids, unaware that his brother is his adversary. When he arrives with only a small detachment of troops, McQuade tries to persuade Jeb to use the Apaches to subdue the Rebels, but Jeb rejects the idea, certain the Indians would kill settlers as well as Confederate soldiers.\nThat evening McQuade, believing that Jeb rather than Vance is the Britton who was once the fianc\u00e9 of McQuade's lonely and unhappy wife Julie (Fleming), tries to embarrass them both socially. McQuade angrily tells Julie that she is still pining for Vance and she leaves him. Vance turns the tables on Jeb\u2019s attempt to trap the Rebels and humiliates him. Returning to the fort on foot and bootless, Jeb is informed by McQuade that he has persuaded the government to negotiate with the Apaches. Soon afterwards McQuade is attacked and killed by Apaches. Vance finds a letter on McQuade's body stating that a Union officer is on his way from Washington, D.C. to parley with the Apache chiefs. Vance waylays the officer and takes his place, discovering that Chief Grey Cloud is actually a disgraced former Army general who married an Apache. Gray Cloud knows the real emissary and Britton admits that he is a Confederate officer trying to keep the Apaches out of the war.\nA group of Apaches is arrested for McQuade's murder. Gray Cloud gives Vance 24 hours to free the prisoners as the price of keeping the Apaches from joining forces with the Union troops. Still posing as a Yankee officer, Vance goes to the jail in San Gil, where the jailed Apaches tell him that McQuade was killed for selling them defective guns and tainted liquor. He encounters Julie, who angrily rejects his explanation that he jilted her because he chose the Confederacy. Before Vance can arrange the escape of the prisoners or seize a shipment of gold coin being sent east by stagecoach, Jeb returns from searching for the Rebels and captures his brother. Vance escapes and reluctantly decides to return to Texas.\nGrey Cloud, under a flag of truce, comes to San Gil with his warriors and promises to stay out of the white man\u2019s war if the prisoners are released, but is killed by a civilian. Vance and his command learn of the ensuing Apache attack, and he orders his men to charge the Apaches and save the town. After the battle, Julie returns to the East, promising to reunite with Vance someday. The brothers shake hands before the Confederates ride away.\n\nCast\nRonald Reagan as Capt.

He went to England at the end of World War II as a member of the Royal Air Force, and settled in Kidderminster in Worcestershire in 1947, where he worked as a civilian lorry driver for the RAF. He began playing for Kidderminster Cricket Club in the Birmingham League, and at the start of the 1952 season, opening the bowling for the club's senior team, he had figures of 7 for 9 and 7 for 37.Worcestershire invited him to play for them, and he made his first-class debut against Sussex in July 1952. He took five wickets in the match (his maiden victim being Ken Suttle) and then held on for 4 not out with Peter Richardson (20 not out) to add the 12 runs needed for a one-wicket victory after his county had collapsed from 192 for 2 to 238 for 9. A week later he claimed four wickets against Warwickshire, then a few days later still he managed 6 for 52 (five of his victims bowled) in what was otherwise a disastrous innings defeat to Derbyshire. In the last match of the season he took a career-best 6 for 51 against Glamorgan; he and Reg Perks (4 for 59) bowled unchanged throughout the first innings. Worcestershire won the game and Lobban finished the season with 23 wickets at 23.69.He took 23 wickets again in 1953, but at a considerably worse average of 34.43, and had only two really successful games: against Oxford University in June, when he took 5 for 70, and then against Sussex in July. On this occasion Lobban claimed eight wickets, his most in a match, including 6 for 103 in the first innings. He also made his highest score with the bat, 18, but Sussex won by five wickets.In 1954 Lobban made only two first-class appearances, and managed only the single wicket of Gloucestershire tail-ender Bomber Wells. In his final game, against Warwickshire at Dudley, his nine first-innings overs cost 51. He bowled just two overs in the second innings as Warwickshire completed an easy ten-wicket win. Lobban played one more Second XI game, against Glamorgan II at Cardiff Arms Park; in this he picked up five wickets.\nHe was also a professional boxer and played rugby union for Kidderminster.He later moved to Canada, where he worked as a teacher in Burnaby, British Columbia. He and his wife Celia had a son and two daughters.\nPassage 9:\nThe Last Outpost (1951 film)\nThe Last Outpost is a 1951 American Technicolor Western film directed by Lewis R. Foster, set in the American Civil War with brothers on opposite sides. The film is character actor Burt Mustin's film debut at the age of 67.\nThe film earned an estimated $1,225,000 at the US box office in 1951.  The Last Outpost had the distinction of being the most successful film for the prolific B movie company, Pine-Thomas Productions. The film was re-released in 1962 by Citation Films Inc. under the title Cavalry Charge.\n\nPlot\nIn 1862, Confederate Army Captain Vance Britton (Reagan) and his cavalry force are capturing most of the supplies sent east along the Santa Fe Trail before they reach the Union Army outpost at San Gil, Arizona, where trading post owner Sam McQuade (Ridgely) deals with the Apache Indians. Union Colonel Jeb Britton (Bennett), Vance's brother, is sent West to stop the Confederate raids, unaware that his brother is his adversary. When he arrives with only a small detachment of troops, McQuade tries to persuade Jeb to use the Apaches to subdue the Rebels, but Jeb rejects the idea, certain the Indians would kill settlers as well as Confederate soldiers.\nThat evening McQuade, believing that Jeb rather than Vance is the Britton who was once the fianc\u00e9 of McQuade's lonely and unhappy wife Julie (Fleming), tries to embarrass them both socially. McQuade angrily tells Julie that she is still pining for Vance and she leaves him. Vance turns the tables on Jeb\u2019s attempt to trap the Rebels and humiliates him. Returning to the fort on foot and bootless, Jeb is informed by McQuade that he has persuaded the government to negotiate with the Apaches. Soon afterwards McQuade is attacked and killed by Apaches. Vance finds a letter on McQuade's body stating that a Union officer is on his way from Washington, D.C. to parley with the Apache chiefs. Vance waylays the officer and takes his place, discovering that Chief Grey Cloud is actually a disgraced former Army general who married an Apache. Gray Cloud knows the real emissary and Britton admits that he is a Confederate officer trying to keep the Apaches out of the war.\nA group of Apaches is arrested for McQuade's murder. Gray Cloud gives Vance 24 hours to free the prisoners as the price of keeping the Apaches from joining forces with the Union troops. Still posing as a Yankee officer, Vance goes to the jail in San Gil, where the jailed Apaches tell him that McQuade was killed for selling them defective guns and tainted liquor. He encounters Julie, who angrily rejects his explanation that he jilted her because he chose the Confederacy. Before Vance can arrange the escape of the prisoners or seize a shipment of gold coin being sent east by stagecoach, Jeb returns from searching for the Rebels and captures his brother. Vance escapes and reluctantly decides to return to Texas.\nGrey Cloud, under a flag of truce, comes to San Gil with his warriors and promises to stay out of the white man\u2019s war if the prisoners are released, but is killed by a civilian. Vance and his command learn of the ensuing Apache attack, and he orders his men to charge the Apaches and save the town. After the battle, Julie returns to the East, promising to reunite with Vance someday. The brothers shake hands before the Confederates ride away.\n\nCast\nRonald Reagan as Capt.

He lived in Set Maat (translated as \"The Place of Truth\"), contemporary Deir el-Medina, on the west bank of the Nile, opposite Thebes. Sennedjem had the title \"Servant in the Place of Truth\". He was buried along with his wife, Iyneferti, and members of his family in a tomb in the village necropolis. His tomb was discovered January 31, 1886. When Sennedjem's tomb was found, it contained furniture from his home, including a stool and a bed, which he used when he was alive.His titles included Servant in the Place of Truth, meaning that he worked on the excavation and decoration of the nearby royal tombs.\n\nSee also\n\nTT1 \u2013 (Tomb of Sennedjem, family and wife)\nPassage 3:\nKristj\u00e1n Eldj\u00e1rn\nKristj\u00e1n Eldj\u00e1rn (Icelandic: [\u02c8k\u02b0r\u026astjaun \u02c8\u025bltjaurtn\u0325]; 6 December 1916 \u2013 14 September 1982) was the third president of Iceland, from 1968 to 1980.\n\nBiography\nKristj\u00e1n was born in Tj\u00f6rn, Svarfa\u00f0ardal, Iceland. His parents were \u00de\u00f3rarinn Kr. Eldj\u00e1rn, a teacher in Tj\u00f6rn, and Sigr\u00fan Sigurhjartard\u00f3ttir. He graduated in archaeology from the University of Copenhagen and taught at the University of Iceland. In 1957 he was awarded a doctorate for his research into pagan burials in Iceland. He was a teacher at the Akureyri Grammar School and the College of Navigation in Reykjav\u00edk, becoming a curator at the National Museum of Iceland in 1945 and its Director in 1947, a position he held until the 1968 presidential election.\nIn 1966\u201368 he hosted a series of educational TV programs on the (then new) Icelandic National Television (R\u00daV), in which he showed the audience some of the National Museum's artefacts and explained their historical context. These programs became quite popular, making him a well known and respected popular figure. This no doubt gave him the incentive needed to run in the 1968 presidential election as a politically non-affiliated candidate.\nStarting as the underdog in the 1968 presidential election, running against Ambassador Gunnar Thoroddsen who initially had a 70% lead in the opinion polls, Kristj\u00e1n won 65.6% of the vote on a 92.2% voter turnout. He was re-elected unopposed in 1972 and 1976. In 1980 he decided not to run for another term, wanting to devote his remaining years entirely to continuing his lifelong academic work.\nPresident Kristj\u00e1n Eldj\u00e1rn died following heart surgery in Cleveland, Ohio on 13 September 1982.His son \u00de\u00f3rarinn Eldj\u00e1rn is one of Iceland's most popular authors, specializing in short stories, but also writing poetry and an occasional novel. His daughter Sigr\u00fan Eldj\u00e1rn is also an author and illustrator of several children's books. \u00de\u00f3rarinn's son, Ari Eldj\u00e1rn, is Iceland's most prominent stand-up comedian.\nPassage 4:\nPlace of birth\nThe place of birth (POB) or birthplace is the place where a person was born. This place is often used in legal documents, together with name and date of birth, to uniquely identify a person. Practice regarding whether this place should be a country, a territory or a city/town/locality differs in different countries, but often city or territory is used for native-born citizen passports and countries for foreign-born ones.\nAs a general rule with respect to passports, if the place of birth is to be a country, it's determined to be the country that currently has sovereignty over the actual place of birth, regardless of when the birth actually occurred. The place of birth is not necessarily the place where the parents of the new baby live. If the baby is born in a hospital in another place, that place is the place of birth. In many countries, this also means that the government requires that the birth of the new baby is registered in the place of birth.\nSome countries place less or no importance on the place of birth, instead using alternative geographical characteristics for the purpose of identity documents. For example, Sweden has used the concept of f\u00f6delsehemort (\"domicile of birth\") since 1947. This means that the domicile of the baby's mother is the registered place of birth. The location of the maternity ward or other physical birthplace is considered unimportant.\nSimilarly, Switzerland uses the concept of place of origin. A child born to Swiss parents is automatically assigned the place of origin of the parent with the same last name, so the child either gets their mother's or father's place of origin. A child born to one Swiss parent and one foreign parent acquires the place of origin of their Swiss parent. In a Swiss passport and identity card, the holder's place of origin is stated, not their place of birth. In Japan, the registered domicile is a similar concept.\nIn some countries (primarily in the Americas), the place of birth automatically determines the nationality of the baby, a practice often referred to by the Latin phrase jus soli. Almost all countries outside the Americas instead attribute nationality based on the nationality(-ies) of the baby's parents (referred to as jus sanguinis).\nThere can be some confusion regarding the place of birth if the birth takes place in an unusual way: when babies are born on an airplane or at sea, difficulties can arise. The place of birth of such a person depends on the law of the countries involved, which include the nationality of the plane or ship, the nationality(-ies) of the parents and/or the location of the plane or ship (if the birth occurs in the territorial waters or airspace of a country).\nSome administrative forms may request the applicant's \"country of birth\". It is important to determine from the requester whether the information requested refers to the applicant's \"place of birth\" or \"nationality at birth\". For example, US citizens born abroad who acquire US citizenship at the time of birth, the nationality at birth will be USA (American), while the place of birth would be the country in which the actual birth takes place.\n\nReference list\n8 FAM 403.4 Place of Birth\nPassage 5:\nBeaulieu-sur-Loire\nBeaulieu-sur-Loire (French pronunciation: \u200b[bolj\u00f8 sy\u0281 lwa\u0281], literally Beaulieu on Loire) is a commune in the Loiret department in north-central France. It is the place of death of Jacques MacDonald, a French general who served in the Napoleonic Wars.\n\nPopulation\nSee also\nCommunes of the Loiret department\nPassage 6:\nPlace of origin\nIn Switzerland, the place of origin (German: Heimatort or B\u00fcrgerort, literally \"home place\" or \"citizen place\"; French: Lieu d'origine; Italian: Luogo di attinenza) denotes where a Swiss citizen has their municipal citizenship, usually inherited from previous generations. It is not to be confused with the place of birth or  place of residence, although two or all three of these locations may be identical depending on the person's circumstances.\n\nAcquisition of municipal citizenship\nSwiss citizenship has three tiers. For a person applying to naturalise as a Swiss citizen, these tiers are as follows:\n\nMunicipal citizenship, granted by the place of residence after fulfilling several preconditions, such as sufficient knowledge of the local language, integration into local society, and a minimum number of years lived in said municipality.\nCantonal (state) citizenship, for which a Swiss municipal citizenship is required. This requires a certain number of years lived in said canton.\nCountry citizenship, for which both of the above are required, also requires a certain number of years lived in Switzerland (except for people married to a Swiss citizen, who may obtain simplified naturalisation without having to reside in Switzerland), and involves a criminal background check.The last two kinds of citizenship are a mere formality, while municipal citizenship is the most significant step in becoming a Swiss citizen. \nNowadays the place of residence determines the municipality where citizenship is acquired, for a new applicant, whereas previously there was a historical reason for preserving the municipal citizenship from earlier generations in the family line, namely to specify which municipality held the responsibility of providing social welfare. The law has now been changed, eliminating this form of allocating responsibility to a municipality other than that of the place of residence. Care needs to be taken when translating the term in Swiss documents which list the historical \"Heimatort\" instead of the usual place of birth and place of residence.\nHowever, any Swiss citizen can apply for a second, a third or even more municipal citizenships for prestige reasons or to show their connection to the place they currently live \u2013 and thus have several places of origin. As the legal significance of the place of origin has waned (see below), Swiss citizens can often apply for municipal citizenship for no more than 100 Swiss francs after having lived in the same municipality for one or two years. In the past, it was common to have to pay between 2,000 and 4,000 Swiss francs as a citizenship fee, because of the financial obligations incumbent on the municipality to grant the citizenship.\nA child born to two Swiss parents is automatically granted the citizenship of the parent whose last name they hold, so the child gets either the mother's or the father's place of origin. A child born to one Swiss parent and one foreign parent acquires the citizenship, and thus the place of origin, of the Swiss parent.\n\nInternational confusion\nAlmost uniquely in the world (with the exception of Japan, which lists one's Registered Domicile; and Sweden, which lists the mother's place of domicile as place of birth), the Swiss identity card, passport and driving licence do not show the holder's birthplace, but only their place of origin. The vast majority of countries show the holder's actual birthplace on identity documents. This can lead to administrative issues for Swiss citizens abroad when asked to demonstrate their actual place of birth, as no such information exists on any official Swiss identification documents. Only a minority of Swiss citizens have a place of origin identical to their birthplace. More confusion comes into play through the fact that people can have more than one place of origin.\n\nSignificance and history\nA citizen of a municipality does not enjoy a larger set of rights than a non-citizen of the same municipality. To vote in communal, cantonal or national matters, only the current place of residence matters \u2013 or in the case of citizens abroad, the last Swiss place of residence.\nThe law previously required that a citizen's place of origin continued to bear all their social welfare costs for two years after the citizen moved away. In 2012, the National Council voted by 151 to 9 votes to abolish this law. The place of domicile is now the sole payer of welfare costs.In 1923, 1937, 1959 and 1967, more cantons signed treaties that assured that the place of domicile had to pay welfare costs instead of the place of origin, reflecting the fact that fewer and fewer people lived in their place of origin (1860: 59%, in 1910: 34%).In 1681, the Tagsatzung \u2013 the then Swiss parliament \u2013 decided that beggars should be deported to their place of origin, especially if they were insufficiently cared for by their residential community.In the 19th century, Swiss municipalities even offered free emigration to the United States if the Swiss citizen agreed to renounce municipal citizenship, and with that the right to receive welfare.\n\nSee also\nAncestral home (Chinese)\nBon-gwan\nRegistered domicile\n\n\n== Notes and references ==\nPassage 7:\nMotherland (disambiguation)\nMotherland is the place of one's birth, the place of one's ancestors, or the place of origin of an ethnic group.\nMotherland may also refer to:\n\nMusic\n\"Motherland\" (anthem), the national anthem of Mauritius\nNational Song (Montserrat), also called \"Motherland\"\nMotherland (Natalie Merchant album), 2001\nMotherland (Arsonists Get All the Girls album), 2011\nMotherland (Daedalus album), 2011\n\"Motherland\" (Crystal Kay song), 2004\n\nFilm and television\nMotherland (1927 film), a 1927 British silent war film\nMotherland (2010 film), a 2010 documentary film\nMotherland (2015 film), a 2015 Turkish drama\nMotherland (2022 film), a 2022 documentary film about the Second Nagorno-Karabakh War\nMotherland (TV series), a 2016 British television series\nMotherland: Fort Salem, a 2020 American science fiction drama series\n\nOther uses\nMotherland Party (disambiguation), the name of several political groups\nPersonifications of Russia, including a list of monuments called Motherland\n\nSee also\nAll pages with titles containing Motherland\nMother Country (disambiguation)\nPassage 8:\nValley of Death\nValley of Death may refer to:\n\nPlaces\nValley of Death (Bydgoszcz), the site of a 1939 Nazi mass murder and mass grave site in northern Poland\nValley of Death (Crimea), the site of the Charge of the Light Brigade in the 1854 Battle of Balaclava\nValley of Death (Gettysburg), the 1863 Gettysburg Battlefield landform of Plum Run\nValley of Death (Dukla Pass), the site of a tank battle during the Battle of the Dukla Pass in 1944 (World War II)\nThe Valley of Death, an area of poisonous volcanic gas near the Kikhpinych volcano in Russia\nThe Valley of Death, an area of poisonous volcanic gas near the Tangkuban Perahu volcano in Indonesia\nValley of Death, a nickname for the highly polluted city of Cubat\u00e3o, Brazil\n\nOther uses\nThe Valley of Death (audio drama), a Doctor Who audio play\nThe Valley of Death (film), a 1968 western film\n\"Valley of Death\", the flawed NewsStand: CNN & Time debut program that caused the Operation Tailwind controversy\nA literary element of \"The Charge of the Light Brigade\" by Alfred, Lord Tennyson\nA reference to the difficulty of covering negative cash flow in the early stages of a start-up company; see Venture capital\n\"The Valley of Death\", a song by the Swedish heavy metal band Sabaton from the 2022 album The War to End All Wars\n\nSee also\nAll pages with titles containing Valley of Death\nDeath Valley (disambiguation)\nValley of the Shadow of Death (disambiguation)\nPassage 9:\nHalld\u00f3ra Eldj\u00e1rn\nHalld\u00f3ra Eldj\u00e1rn (24 November 1923 \u2013 21 December 2008) was the wife of Icelandic President Kristj\u00e1n Eldj\u00e1rn and First Lady of Iceland from 1968 to 1980.\nHalld\u00f3ra Ing\u00f3lfsd\u00f3ttir was born and raised in \u00cdsafj\u00f6r\u00f0ur.

He lived in Set Maat (translated as \"The Place of Truth\"), contemporary Deir el-Medina, on the west bank of the Nile, opposite Thebes. Sennedjem had the title \"Servant in the Place of Truth\". He was buried along with his wife, Iyneferti, and members of his family in a tomb in the village necropolis. His tomb was discovered January 31, 1886. When Sennedjem's tomb was found, it contained furniture from his home, including a stool and a bed, which he used when he was alive.His titles included Servant in the Place of Truth, meaning that he worked on the excavation and decoration of the nearby royal tombs.\n\nSee also\n\nTT1 \u2013 (Tomb of Sennedjem, family and wife)\nPassage 3:\nKristj\u00e1n Eldj\u00e1rn\nKristj\u00e1n Eldj\u00e1rn (Icelandic: [\u02c8k\u02b0r\u026astjaun \u02c8\u025bltjaurtn\u0325]; 6 December 1916 \u2013 14 September 1982) was the third president of Iceland, from 1968 to 1980.\n\nBiography\nKristj\u00e1n was born in Tj\u00f6rn, Svarfa\u00f0ardal, Iceland. His parents were \u00de\u00f3rarinn Kr. Eldj\u00e1rn, a teacher in Tj\u00f6rn, and Sigr\u00fan Sigurhjartard\u00f3ttir. He graduated in archaeology from the University of Copenhagen and taught at the University of Iceland. In 1957 he was awarded a doctorate for his research into pagan burials in Iceland. He was a teacher at the Akureyri Grammar School and the College of Navigation in Reykjav\u00edk, becoming a curator at the National Museum of Iceland in 1945 and its Director in 1947, a position he held until the 1968 presidential election.\nIn 1966\u201368 he hosted a series of educational TV programs on the (then new) Icelandic National Television (R\u00daV), in which he showed the audience some of the National Museum's artefacts and explained their historical context. These programs became quite popular, making him a well known and respected popular figure. This no doubt gave him the incentive needed to run in the 1968 presidential election as a politically non-affiliated candidate.\nStarting as the underdog in the 1968 presidential election, running against Ambassador Gunnar Thoroddsen who initially had a 70% lead in the opinion polls, Kristj\u00e1n won 65.6% of the vote on a 92.2% voter turnout. He was re-elected unopposed in 1972 and 1976. In 1980 he decided not to run for another term, wanting to devote his remaining years entirely to continuing his lifelong academic work.\nPresident Kristj\u00e1n Eldj\u00e1rn died following heart surgery in Cleveland, Ohio on 13 September 1982.His son \u00de\u00f3rarinn Eldj\u00e1rn is one of Iceland's most popular authors, specializing in short stories, but also writing poetry and an occasional novel. His daughter Sigr\u00fan Eldj\u00e1rn is also an author and illustrator of several children's books. \u00de\u00f3rarinn's son, Ari Eldj\u00e1rn, is Iceland's most prominent stand-up comedian.\nPassage 4:\nPlace of birth\nThe place of birth (POB) or birthplace is the place where a person was born. This place is often used in legal documents, together with name and date of birth, to uniquely identify a person. Practice regarding whether this place should be a country, a territory or a city/town/locality differs in different countries, but often city or territory is used for native-born citizen passports and countries for foreign-born ones.\nAs a general rule with respect to passports, if the place of birth is to be a country, it's determined to be the country that currently has sovereignty over the actual place of birth, regardless of when the birth actually occurred. The place of birth is not necessarily the place where the parents of the new baby live. If the baby is born in a hospital in another place, that place is the place of birth. In many countries, this also means that the government requires that the birth of the new baby is registered in the place of birth.\nSome countries place less or no importance on the place of birth, instead using alternative geographical characteristics for the purpose of identity documents. For example, Sweden has used the concept of f\u00f6delsehemort (\"domicile of birth\") since 1947. This means that the domicile of the baby's mother is the registered place of birth. The location of the maternity ward or other physical birthplace is considered unimportant.\nSimilarly, Switzerland uses the concept of place of origin. A child born to Swiss parents is automatically assigned the place of origin of the parent with the same last name, so the child either gets their mother's or father's place of origin. A child born to one Swiss parent and one foreign parent acquires the place of origin of their Swiss parent. In a Swiss passport and identity card, the holder's place of origin is stated, not their place of birth. In Japan, the registered domicile is a similar concept.\nIn some countries (primarily in the Americas), the place of birth automatically determines the nationality of the baby, a practice often referred to by the Latin phrase jus soli. Almost all countries outside the Americas instead attribute nationality based on the nationality(-ies) of the baby's parents (referred to as jus sanguinis).\nThere can be some confusion regarding the place of birth if the birth takes place in an unusual way: when babies are born on an airplane or at sea, difficulties can arise. The place of birth of such a person depends on the law of the countries involved, which include the nationality of the plane or ship, the nationality(-ies) of the parents and/or the location of the plane or ship (if the birth occurs in the territorial waters or airspace of a country).\nSome administrative forms may request the applicant's \"country of birth\". It is important to determine from the requester whether the information requested refers to the applicant's \"place of birth\" or \"nationality at birth\". For example, US citizens born abroad who acquire US citizenship at the time of birth, the nationality at birth will be USA (American), while the place of birth would be the country in which the actual birth takes place.\n\nReference list\n8 FAM 403.4 Place of Birth\nPassage 5:\nBeaulieu-sur-Loire\nBeaulieu-sur-Loire (French pronunciation: \u200b[bolj\u00f8 sy\u0281 lwa\u0281], literally Beaulieu on Loire) is a commune in the Loiret department in north-central France. It is the place of death of Jacques MacDonald, a French general who served in the Napoleonic Wars.\n\nPopulation\nSee also\nCommunes of the Loiret department\nPassage 6:\nPlace of origin\nIn Switzerland, the place of origin (German: Heimatort or B\u00fcrgerort, literally \"home place\" or \"citizen place\"; French: Lieu d'origine; Italian: Luogo di attinenza) denotes where a Swiss citizen has their municipal citizenship, usually inherited from previous generations. It is not to be confused with the place of birth or  place of residence, although two or all three of these locations may be identical depending on the person's circumstances.\n\nAcquisition of municipal citizenship\nSwiss citizenship has three tiers. For a person applying to naturalise as a Swiss citizen, these tiers are as follows:\n\nMunicipal citizenship, granted by the place of residence after fulfilling several preconditions, such as sufficient knowledge of the local language, integration into local society, and a minimum number of years lived in said municipality.\nCantonal (state) citizenship, for which a Swiss municipal citizenship is required. This requires a certain number of years lived in said canton.\nCountry citizenship, for which both of the above are required, also requires a certain number of years lived in Switzerland (except for people married to a Swiss citizen, who may obtain simplified naturalisation without having to reside in Switzerland), and involves a criminal background check.The last two kinds of citizenship are a mere formality, while municipal citizenship is the most significant step in becoming a Swiss citizen. \nNowadays the place of residence determines the municipality where citizenship is acquired, for a new applicant, whereas previously there was a historical reason for preserving the municipal citizenship from earlier generations in the family line, namely to specify which municipality held the responsibility of providing social welfare. The law has now been changed, eliminating this form of allocating responsibility to a municipality other than that of the place of residence. Care needs to be taken when translating the term in Swiss documents which list the historical \"Heimatort\" instead of the usual place of birth and place of residence.\nHowever, any Swiss citizen can apply for a second, a third or even more municipal citizenships for prestige reasons or to show their connection to the place they currently live \u2013 and thus have several places of origin. As the legal significance of the place of origin has waned (see below), Swiss citizens can often apply for municipal citizenship for no more than 100 Swiss francs after having lived in the same municipality for one or two years. In the past, it was common to have to pay between 2,000 and 4,000 Swiss francs as a citizenship fee, because of the financial obligations incumbent on the municipality to grant the citizenship.\nA child born to two Swiss parents is automatically granted the citizenship of the parent whose last name they hold, so the child gets either the mother's or the father's place of origin. A child born to one Swiss parent and one foreign parent acquires the citizenship, and thus the place of origin, of the Swiss parent.\n\nInternational confusion\nAlmost uniquely in the world (with the exception of Japan, which lists one's Registered Domicile; and Sweden, which lists the mother's place of domicile as place of birth), the Swiss identity card, passport and driving licence do not show the holder's birthplace, but only their place of origin. The vast majority of countries show the holder's actual birthplace on identity documents. This can lead to administrative issues for Swiss citizens abroad when asked to demonstrate their actual place of birth, as no such information exists on any official Swiss identification documents. Only a minority of Swiss citizens have a place of origin identical to their birthplace. More confusion comes into play through the fact that people can have more than one place of origin.\n\nSignificance and history\nA citizen of a municipality does not enjoy a larger set of rights than a non-citizen of the same municipality. To vote in communal, cantonal or national matters, only the current place of residence matters \u2013 or in the case of citizens abroad, the last Swiss place of residence.\nThe law previously required that a citizen's place of origin continued to bear all their social welfare costs for two years after the citizen moved away. In 2012, the National Council voted by 151 to 9 votes to abolish this law. The place of domicile is now the sole payer of welfare costs.In 1923, 1937, 1959 and 1967, more cantons signed treaties that assured that the place of domicile had to pay welfare costs instead of the place of origin, reflecting the fact that fewer and fewer people lived in their place of origin (1860: 59%, in 1910: 34%).In 1681, the Tagsatzung \u2013 the then Swiss parliament \u2013 decided that beggars should be deported to their place of origin, especially if they were insufficiently cared for by their residential community.In the 19th century, Swiss municipalities even offered free emigration to the United States if the Swiss citizen agreed to renounce municipal citizenship, and with that the right to receive welfare.\n\nSee also\nAncestral home (Chinese)\nBon-gwan\nRegistered domicile\n\n\n== Notes and references ==\nPassage 7:\nMotherland (disambiguation)\nMotherland is the place of one's birth, the place of one's ancestors, or the place of origin of an ethnic group.\nMotherland may also refer to:\n\nMusic\n\"Motherland\" (anthem), the national anthem of Mauritius\nNational Song (Montserrat), also called \"Motherland\"\nMotherland (Natalie Merchant album), 2001\nMotherland (Arsonists Get All the Girls album), 2011\nMotherland (Daedalus album), 2011\n\"Motherland\" (Crystal Kay song), 2004\n\nFilm and television\nMotherland (1927 film), a 1927 British silent war film\nMotherland (2010 film), a 2010 documentary film\nMotherland (2015 film), a 2015 Turkish drama\nMotherland (2022 film), a 2022 documentary film about the Second Nagorno-Karabakh War\nMotherland (TV series), a 2016 British television series\nMotherland: Fort Salem, a 2020 American science fiction drama series\n\nOther uses\nMotherland Party (disambiguation), the name of several political groups\nPersonifications of Russia, including a list of monuments called Motherland\n\nSee also\nAll pages with titles containing Motherland\nMother Country (disambiguation)\nPassage 8:\nValley of Death\nValley of Death may refer to:\n\nPlaces\nValley of Death (Bydgoszcz), the site of a 1939 Nazi mass murder and mass grave site in northern Poland\nValley of Death (Crimea), the site of the Charge of the Light Brigade in the 1854 Battle of Balaclava\nValley of Death (Gettysburg), the 1863 Gettysburg Battlefield landform of Plum Run\nValley of Death (Dukla Pass), the site of a tank battle during the Battle of the Dukla Pass in 1944 (World War II)\nThe Valley of Death, an area of poisonous volcanic gas near the Kikhpinych volcano in Russia\nThe Valley of Death, an area of poisonous volcanic gas near the Tangkuban Perahu volcano in Indonesia\nValley of Death, a nickname for the highly polluted city of Cubat\u00e3o, Brazil\n\nOther uses\nThe Valley of Death (audio drama), a Doctor Who audio play\nThe Valley of Death (film), a 1968 western film\n\"Valley of Death\", the flawed NewsStand: CNN & Time debut program that caused the Operation Tailwind controversy\nA literary element of \"The Charge of the Light Brigade\" by Alfred, Lord Tennyson\nA reference to the difficulty of covering negative cash flow in the early stages of a start-up company; see Venture capital\n\"The Valley of Death\", a song by the Swedish heavy metal band Sabaton from the 2022 album The War to End All Wars\n\nSee also\nAll pages with titles containing Valley of Death\nDeath Valley (disambiguation)\nValley of the Shadow of Death (disambiguation)\nPassage 9:\nHalld\u00f3ra Eldj\u00e1rn\nHalld\u00f3ra Eldj\u00e1rn (24 November 1923 \u2013 21 December 2008) was the wife of Icelandic President Kristj\u00e1n Eldj\u00e1rn and First Lady of Iceland from 1968 to 1980.\nHalld\u00f3ra Ing\u00f3lfsd\u00f3ttir was born and raised in \u00cdsafj\u00f6r\u00f0ur.

In the first innings of his first match, against Lancashire at The Oval, he took five wickets for 81 runs.In his first full season, 1948, he was Surrey's leading wicket-taker and in the last home game of the season he was awarded his county cap \u2013 he celebrated by taking eight Northamptonshire wickets for 46 runs at The Oval, six of them coming in the space of 6.3 overs for seven runs. This would remain the best bowling performance of his first-class career, not surpassed, but he did equal it seven years later. In the following game, the last away match of the season, he took 10 Hampshire wickets for 150 runs in the match at Bournemouth. In the 1948 season as a whole, he took 91 wickets at an average of 28.07. As a tail-end left-handed batsman, he managed just 93 runs in the season at an average of 4.22.The emergence of Tony Lock as a slow left-arm bowler in 1949 brought a stuttering end of McMahon's Surrey career. Though he played in 12 first-class matches in the 1949 season, McMahon took only 19 wickets; a similar number of matches in 1950 brought 34 wickets. In 1951, he played just seven times and in 1952 only three times. In 1953, Lock split the first finger of his left hand, and played in only 11 of Surrey's County Championship matches; McMahon played as his deputy in 14 Championship matches, though a measure of their comparative merits was that Lock's 11 games produced 67 wickets at 12.38 runs apiece, while McMahon's 14 games brought him 45 wickets at the, for him, low average of 21.53. At the end of the 1953 season, McMahon was allowed to leave Surrey to join Somerset, then languishing at the foot of the County Championship and recruiting widely from other counties and other countries.\n\nSomerset cricketer\nSomerset's slow bowling in 1954 was in the hands of leg-spinner Johnny Lawrence, with support from the off-spin of Jim Hilton while promising off-spinner Brian Langford was on national service. McMahon filled a vacancy for a left-arm orthodox spinner that had been there since the retirement of Horace Hazell at the end of the 1952 season; Hazell's apparent successor, Roy Smith, had failed to realise his promise as a bowler in 1953, though his batting had advanced significantly.\nMcMahon instantly became a first-team regular and played in almost every match during his four years with the county, not missing a single Championship game until he was controversially dropped from the side in August 1957, after which he did not play in the Championship again.In the 1954 season, McMahon, alongside fellow newcomer Hilton, was something of a disappointment, according to Wisden: \"The new spin bowlers, McMahon and Hilton, did not attain to the best standards of their craft in a wet summer, yet, like the rest of the attack, they would have fared better with reasonable support in the field and from their own batsmen,\" it said. McMahon took 85 wickets at an average of 27.47 (Hilton took only 42 at a higher average). His best match was against Essex at Weston-super-Mare where he took six for 96 in the first innings and five for 45 in the second to finish with match figures of 11 for 141, which were the best of his career. He was awarded his county cap in the 1954 season, but Somerset remained at the bottom of the table.\nThe figures for the 1955 were similar: McMahon this time took 75 wickets at 28.77 apiece. There was a small improvement in his batting and the arrival of Bryan Lobb elevated McMahon to No 10 in the batting order for most of the season, and he responded with 262 runs and an average of 9.03. This included his highest-ever score, 24, made in the match against Sussex at Frome. A week later in Somerset's next match, he equalled his best-ever bowling performance, taking eight Kent wickets for 46 runs in the first innings of a match at Yeovil through what Wisden called \"clever variation of flight and spin\". These matches brought two victories for Somerset, but there were only two others in the 1955 season and the side finished at the bottom of the Championship for the fourth season running.At the end of the 1955 season, Lawrence retired and McMahon became Somerset's senior spin bowler for the 1956 season, with Langford returning from National Service as the main support. McMahon responded with his most successful season so far, taking 103 wickets at an average of 25.57, the only season in his career in which he exceeded 100 wickets. The bowling average improved still further in 1957 to 23.10 when McMahon took 86 wickets. But his season came to an abrupt end in mid-August 1957 when, after 108 consecutive Championship matches, he was dropped from the first team during the Weston-super-Mare festival. Though he played some games for the second eleven later in August, he regained his place in the first team for only a single end-of-season friendly match, and he was told that his services were not required for the future, a decision, said Wisden, that \"proved highly controversial\".\n\nSacked by Somerset\nThe reason behind McMahon's sacking did not become public knowledge for many years. In its obituary of him in 2002, McMahon was described by Wisden as \"a man who embraced the antipodean virtues of candour and conviviality\". It went on: \"Legend tells of a night at the Flying Horse Inn in Nottingham when he beheaded the gladioli with an ornamental sword, crying: 'When Mac drinks, everybody drinks!'\" The obituary recounts a further escapade in second eleven match at Midsomer Norton where a curfew imposed on the team was circumvented by \"a POW-type loop\" organised by McMahon, \"with his team-mates escaping through a ground-storey window and then presenting themselves again\". As the only Somerset second eleven match that McMahon played in at Midsomer Norton was right at the end of the 1957 season, this may have been the final straw. But in any case there had been \"an embarrassing episode at Swansea's Grand Hotel\" earlier in the season, also involving Jim Hilton, who was also dismissed at the end of the season. Team-mates and club members petitioned for McMahon to be reinstated, but the county club was not to be moved.\nAfter a period in Lancashire League cricket with Milnrow Cricket Club, McMahon moved back to London where he did office work, later contributing some articles to cricket magazines.\n\n\n== Notes and references ==\nPassage 8:\nHartley Lobban\nHartley W Lobban (9 May 1926 \u2013 15 October 2004) was a Jamaican-born first-class cricketer who played 17 matches for Worcestershire in the early 1950s.\n\nLife and career\nLobban played little cricket in Jamaica. He went to England at the end of World War II as a member of the Royal Air Force, and settled in Kidderminster in Worcestershire in 1947, where he worked as a civilian lorry driver for the RAF. He began playing for Kidderminster Cricket Club in the Birmingham League, and at the start of the 1952 season, opening the bowling for the club's senior team, he had figures of 7 for 9 and 7 for 37.Worcestershire invited him to play for them, and he made his first-class debut against Sussex in July 1952. He took five wickets in the match (his maiden victim being Ken Suttle) and then held on for 4 not out with Peter Richardson (20 not out) to add the 12 runs needed for a one-wicket victory after his county had collapsed from 192 for 2 to 238 for 9. A week later he claimed four wickets against Warwickshire, then a few days later still he managed 6 for 52 (five of his victims bowled) in what was otherwise a disastrous innings defeat to Derbyshire. In the last match of the season he took a career-best 6 for 51 against Glamorgan; he and Reg Perks (4 for 59) bowled unchanged throughout the first innings. Worcestershire won the game and Lobban finished the season with 23 wickets at 23.69.He took 23 wickets again in 1953, but at a considerably worse average of 34.43, and had only two really successful games: against Oxford University in June, when he took 5 for 70, and then against Sussex in July. On this occasion Lobban claimed eight wickets, his most in a match, including 6 for 103 in the first innings. He also made his highest score with the bat, 18, but Sussex won by five wickets.In 1954 Lobban made only two first-class appearances, and managed only the single wicket of Gloucestershire tail-ender Bomber Wells. In his final game, against Warwickshire at Dudley, his nine first-innings overs cost 51. He bowled just two overs in the second innings as Warwickshire completed an easy ten-wicket win. Lobban played one more Second XI game, against Glamorgan II at Cardiff Arms Park; in this he picked up five wickets.\nHe was also a professional boxer and played rugby union for Kidderminster.He later moved to Canada, where he worked as a teacher in Burnaby, British Columbia. He and his wife Celia had a son and two daughters.\nPassage 9:\nHenry Moore (cricketer)\nHenry Walter Moore (1849 \u2013 20 August 1916) was an English-born first-class cricketer who spent most of his life in New Zealand.\n\nLife and family\nHenry Moore was born in Cranbrook, Kent, in 1849. He was the son of the Reverend Edward Moore and Lady Harriet Janet Sarah Montagu-Scott, who was one of the daughters of the 4th Duke of Buccleuch. One of his brothers, Arthur, became an admiral and was knighted. Their great \ngrandfather was John Moore, Archbishop of Canterbury from 1783 to 1805. One of their sisters was a maid of honour to Queen Victoria.Moore went to New Zealand in the 1870s and lived in Geraldine and Christchurch. He married Henrietta Lysaght of H\u0101wera in November 1879, and they had one son. In May 1884 she died a few days after giving birth to a daughter, who also died.In 1886 Moore became a Justice of the Peace in Geraldine. In 1897 he married Alice Fish of Geraldine. They moved to England four years before his death in 1916.\n\nCricket career\nMoore was a right-handed middle-order batsman. In consecutive seasons, 1876\u201377 and 1877\u201378, playing for Canterbury, he made the highest score in the short New Zealand first-class season: 76 and 75 respectively. His 76 came in his first match for Canterbury, against Otago. He went to the wicket early on the first day with the score at 7 for 2 and put on 99 for the third wicket with Charles Corfe before he was out with the score at 106 for 3 after a \"very fine exhibition of free hitting, combined with good defence\". Canterbury were all out for 133, but went on to win the match. His 75 came in the next season's match against Otago, when he took the score from 22 for 2 to 136 for 6. The New Zealand cricket historian Tom Reese said, \"Right from the beginning he smote the bowling hip and thigh, going out of his ground to indulge in some forceful driving.\" Canterbury won again.Moore led the batting averages in the Canterbury Cricket Association in 1877\u201378 with 379 runs at an average of 34.4. Also in 1877\u201378, he was a member of the Canterbury team that inflicted the only defeat on the touring Australians. In 1896\u201397, at the age of 47, he top-scored in each innings for a South Canterbury XVIII against the touring Queensland cricket team.\nPassage 10:\nDomenico Distilo\nDomenico Distilo (born 25 December 1978 in Rome, Lazio, Italy) is a filmmaker living and working between Rome, Italy and Berlin, Germany.\nHe graduated in film direction from the Centro Sperimentale di Cinematografia in Rome with the film Unexpected (Inatteso), a documentary on the demand for political asylum in Italy, which was screened at the Festival dei Popoli in Florence and at the Berlinale, within the section \"Forum\" in 2006.\nIn 2008, he won the national prize Premio Solinas for the screenplay of the feature film When elephants fight (Quando gli elefanti combattono), written in collaboration with Filippo Gravino and Guido Iuculano.In 2009, he joined the production company Sciara, where he works as director and producer.\nIn 2011, he directed two documentaries for RAI 3, the Italian cultural public channel: Urban extremes - Jerusalem (Estremi urbani, Gerusalemme), on the territorial conflict in Jerusalem and Romany imaginary - Minority artists (Immaginario Rom - Artisti Contro), on Romany art in Hungary.\nDistilo's works generally focus on social issues, with a special interest in various forms of contemporary art.\nIn his movie Deep time (Margini di sottosuolo) (2012), he explored the boundaries between documentary and fiction with a story on archeology and the feelings that bound people to their past.\nIn 2018 his documentary Manga Do, Igort and the way of the manga won the audience award at the Biografilm Festival in Bologna.

In the first innings of his first match, against Lancashire at The Oval, he took five wickets for 81 runs.In his first full season, 1948, he was Surrey's leading wicket-taker and in the last home game of the season he was awarded his county cap \u2013 he celebrated by taking eight Northamptonshire wickets for 46 runs at The Oval, six of them coming in the space of 6.3 overs for seven runs. This would remain the best bowling performance of his first-class career, not surpassed, but he did equal it seven years later. In the following game, the last away match of the season, he took 10 Hampshire wickets for 150 runs in the match at Bournemouth. In the 1948 season as a whole, he took 91 wickets at an average of 28.07. As a tail-end left-handed batsman, he managed just 93 runs in the season at an average of 4.22.The emergence of Tony Lock as a slow left-arm bowler in 1949 brought a stuttering end of McMahon's Surrey career. Though he played in 12 first-class matches in the 1949 season, McMahon took only 19 wickets; a similar number of matches in 1950 brought 34 wickets. In 1951, he played just seven times and in 1952 only three times. In 1953, Lock split the first finger of his left hand, and played in only 11 of Surrey's County Championship matches; McMahon played as his deputy in 14 Championship matches, though a measure of their comparative merits was that Lock's 11 games produced 67 wickets at 12.38 runs apiece, while McMahon's 14 games brought him 45 wickets at the, for him, low average of 21.53. At the end of the 1953 season, McMahon was allowed to leave Surrey to join Somerset, then languishing at the foot of the County Championship and recruiting widely from other counties and other countries.\n\nSomerset cricketer\nSomerset's slow bowling in 1954 was in the hands of leg-spinner Johnny Lawrence, with support from the off-spin of Jim Hilton while promising off-spinner Brian Langford was on national service. McMahon filled a vacancy for a left-arm orthodox spinner that had been there since the retirement of Horace Hazell at the end of the 1952 season; Hazell's apparent successor, Roy Smith, had failed to realise his promise as a bowler in 1953, though his batting had advanced significantly.\nMcMahon instantly became a first-team regular and played in almost every match during his four years with the county, not missing a single Championship game until he was controversially dropped from the side in August 1957, after which he did not play in the Championship again.In the 1954 season, McMahon, alongside fellow newcomer Hilton, was something of a disappointment, according to Wisden: \"The new spin bowlers, McMahon and Hilton, did not attain to the best standards of their craft in a wet summer, yet, like the rest of the attack, they would have fared better with reasonable support in the field and from their own batsmen,\" it said. McMahon took 85 wickets at an average of 27.47 (Hilton took only 42 at a higher average). His best match was against Essex at Weston-super-Mare where he took six for 96 in the first innings and five for 45 in the second to finish with match figures of 11 for 141, which were the best of his career. He was awarded his county cap in the 1954 season, but Somerset remained at the bottom of the table.\nThe figures for the 1955 were similar: McMahon this time took 75 wickets at 28.77 apiece. There was a small improvement in his batting and the arrival of Bryan Lobb elevated McMahon to No 10 in the batting order for most of the season, and he responded with 262 runs and an average of 9.03. This included his highest-ever score, 24, made in the match against Sussex at Frome. A week later in Somerset's next match, he equalled his best-ever bowling performance, taking eight Kent wickets for 46 runs in the first innings of a match at Yeovil through what Wisden called \"clever variation of flight and spin\". These matches brought two victories for Somerset, but there were only two others in the 1955 season and the side finished at the bottom of the Championship for the fourth season running.At the end of the 1955 season, Lawrence retired and McMahon became Somerset's senior spin bowler for the 1956 season, with Langford returning from National Service as the main support. McMahon responded with his most successful season so far, taking 103 wickets at an average of 25.57, the only season in his career in which he exceeded 100 wickets. The bowling average improved still further in 1957 to 23.10 when McMahon took 86 wickets. But his season came to an abrupt end in mid-August 1957 when, after 108 consecutive Championship matches, he was dropped from the first team during the Weston-super-Mare festival. Though he played some games for the second eleven later in August, he regained his place in the first team for only a single end-of-season friendly match, and he was told that his services were not required for the future, a decision, said Wisden, that \"proved highly controversial\".\n\nSacked by Somerset\nThe reason behind McMahon's sacking did not become public knowledge for many years. In its obituary of him in 2002, McMahon was described by Wisden as \"a man who embraced the antipodean virtues of candour and conviviality\". It went on: \"Legend tells of a night at the Flying Horse Inn in Nottingham when he beheaded the gladioli with an ornamental sword, crying: 'When Mac drinks, everybody drinks!'\" The obituary recounts a further escapade in second eleven match at Midsomer Norton where a curfew imposed on the team was circumvented by \"a POW-type loop\" organised by McMahon, \"with his team-mates escaping through a ground-storey window and then presenting themselves again\". As the only Somerset second eleven match that McMahon played in at Midsomer Norton was right at the end of the 1957 season, this may have been the final straw. But in any case there had been \"an embarrassing episode at Swansea's Grand Hotel\" earlier in the season, also involving Jim Hilton, who was also dismissed at the end of the season. Team-mates and club members petitioned for McMahon to be reinstated, but the county club was not to be moved.\nAfter a period in Lancashire League cricket with Milnrow Cricket Club, McMahon moved back to London where he did office work, later contributing some articles to cricket magazines.\n\n\n== Notes and references ==\nPassage 8:\nHartley Lobban\nHartley W Lobban (9 May 1926 \u2013 15 October 2004) was a Jamaican-born first-class cricketer who played 17 matches for Worcestershire in the early 1950s.\n\nLife and career\nLobban played little cricket in Jamaica. He went to England at the end of World War II as a member of the Royal Air Force, and settled in Kidderminster in Worcestershire in 1947, where he worked as a civilian lorry driver for the RAF. He began playing for Kidderminster Cricket Club in the Birmingham League, and at the start of the 1952 season, opening the bowling for the club's senior team, he had figures of 7 for 9 and 7 for 37.Worcestershire invited him to play for them, and he made his first-class debut against Sussex in July 1952. He took five wickets in the match (his maiden victim being Ken Suttle) and then held on for 4 not out with Peter Richardson (20 not out) to add the 12 runs needed for a one-wicket victory after his county had collapsed from 192 for 2 to 238 for 9. A week later he claimed four wickets against Warwickshire, then a few days later still he managed 6 for 52 (five of his victims bowled) in what was otherwise a disastrous innings defeat to Derbyshire. In the last match of the season he took a career-best 6 for 51 against Glamorgan; he and Reg Perks (4 for 59) bowled unchanged throughout the first innings. Worcestershire won the game and Lobban finished the season with 23 wickets at 23.69.He took 23 wickets again in 1953, but at a considerably worse average of 34.43, and had only two really successful games: against Oxford University in June, when he took 5 for 70, and then against Sussex in July. On this occasion Lobban claimed eight wickets, his most in a match, including 6 for 103 in the first innings. He also made his highest score with the bat, 18, but Sussex won by five wickets.In 1954 Lobban made only two first-class appearances, and managed only the single wicket of Gloucestershire tail-ender Bomber Wells. In his final game, against Warwickshire at Dudley, his nine first-innings overs cost 51. He bowled just two overs in the second innings as Warwickshire completed an easy ten-wicket win. Lobban played one more Second XI game, against Glamorgan II at Cardiff Arms Park; in this he picked up five wickets.\nHe was also a professional boxer and played rugby union for Kidderminster.He later moved to Canada, where he worked as a teacher in Burnaby, British Columbia. He and his wife Celia had a son and two daughters.\nPassage 9:\nHenry Moore (cricketer)\nHenry Walter Moore (1849 \u2013 20 August 1916) was an English-born first-class cricketer who spent most of his life in New Zealand.\n\nLife and family\nHenry Moore was born in Cranbrook, Kent, in 1849. He was the son of the Reverend Edward Moore and Lady Harriet Janet Sarah Montagu-Scott, who was one of the daughters of the 4th Duke of Buccleuch. One of his brothers, Arthur, became an admiral and was knighted. Their great \ngrandfather was John Moore, Archbishop of Canterbury from 1783 to 1805. One of their sisters was a maid of honour to Queen Victoria.Moore went to New Zealand in the 1870s and lived in Geraldine and Christchurch. He married Henrietta Lysaght of H\u0101wera in November 1879, and they had one son. In May 1884 she died a few days after giving birth to a daughter, who also died.In 1886 Moore became a Justice of the Peace in Geraldine. In 1897 he married Alice Fish of Geraldine. They moved to England four years before his death in 1916.\n\nCricket career\nMoore was a right-handed middle-order batsman. In consecutive seasons, 1876\u201377 and 1877\u201378, playing for Canterbury, he made the highest score in the short New Zealand first-class season: 76 and 75 respectively. His 76 came in his first match for Canterbury, against Otago. He went to the wicket early on the first day with the score at 7 for 2 and put on 99 for the third wicket with Charles Corfe before he was out with the score at 106 for 3 after a \"very fine exhibition of free hitting, combined with good defence\". Canterbury were all out for 133, but went on to win the match. His 75 came in the next season's match against Otago, when he took the score from 22 for 2 to 136 for 6. The New Zealand cricket historian Tom Reese said, \"Right from the beginning he smote the bowling hip and thigh, going out of his ground to indulge in some forceful driving.\" Canterbury won again.Moore led the batting averages in the Canterbury Cricket Association in 1877\u201378 with 379 runs at an average of 34.4. Also in 1877\u201378, he was a member of the Canterbury team that inflicted the only defeat on the touring Australians. In 1896\u201397, at the age of 47, he top-scored in each innings for a South Canterbury XVIII against the touring Queensland cricket team.\nPassage 10:\nDomenico Distilo\nDomenico Distilo (born 25 December 1978 in Rome, Lazio, Italy) is a filmmaker living and working between Rome, Italy and Berlin, Germany.\nHe graduated in film direction from the Centro Sperimentale di Cinematografia in Rome with the film Unexpected (Inatteso), a documentary on the demand for political asylum in Italy, which was screened at the Festival dei Popoli in Florence and at the Berlinale, within the section \"Forum\" in 2006.\nIn 2008, he won the national prize Premio Solinas for the screenplay of the feature film When elephants fight (Quando gli elefanti combattono), written in collaboration with Filippo Gravino and Guido Iuculano.In 2009, he joined the production company Sciara, where he works as director and producer.\nIn 2011, he directed two documentaries for RAI 3, the Italian cultural public channel: Urban extremes - Jerusalem (Estremi urbani, Gerusalemme), on the territorial conflict in Jerusalem and Romany imaginary - Minority artists (Immaginario Rom - Artisti Contro), on Romany art in Hungary.\nDistilo's works generally focus on social issues, with a special interest in various forms of contemporary art.\nIn his movie Deep time (Margini di sottosuolo) (2012), he explored the boundaries between documentary and fiction with a story on archeology and the feelings that bound people to their past.\nIn 2018 his documentary Manga Do, Igort and the way of the manga won the audience award at the Biografilm Festival in Bologna.

He was briefly adopted into the Nomura family and became known as Nomura Yakichi, though he was later restored to the Inoue family.\nMasaru Inoue was brought up as the son of a samurai belonging to the Ch\u014dsh\u016b fief. At 15, he entered the Nagasaki Naval Academy established by the Tokugawa shogunate under the direction of a Dutch naval officer. In 1863, Inoue and four friends from the Ch\u014dsh\u016b clan stowed away on a vessel to the United Kingdom. He studied civil engineering and mining at University College London and returned to Japan in 1868. After working for the government as a technical officer supervising the mining industry, he was appointed Director of the Railway Board in 1871. Inoue played a leading role in Japan's railway planning and construction, including the construction of the Nakasendo Railway, the selection of the alternative route (Tokaido), and the proposals for future mainline railway networks.In 1891 Masaru Inoue founded Koiwai Farm with Yanosuke Iwasaki and Shin Onogi.

He was the second son of Cleombrotus I, and grandfather of Areus I, who succeeded him. Although he reigned for more than 60 years, his life is completely unknown, apart from a victory at the Pythian Games in 336 BC. Several theories have been suggested by modern historians to explain such inactivity, but none has gained consensus.\n\nLife and reign\nCleomenes was the second son of king Cleombrotus I (r.\u2009380\u2013371), who belonged to the Agiad dynasty, one of the two royal families of Sparta (the other being the Eurypontids). Cleombrotus died fighting Thebes at the famous Battle of Leuctra in 371. His eldest son Agesipolis II succeeded him, but he died soon after in 370. Cleomenes' reign was instead exceptionally long, lasting 60 years and 10 months according to Diodorus of Sicily, a historian of the 1st century BC. In a second statement, Diodorus nevertheless tells that Cleomenes II reigned 34 years, but he confused him with his namesake Cleomenes I (r.\u2009524\u2013490).\n\nDespite the outstanding length of his reign, very little can be said about Cleomenes. He has been described by modern historians as a \"nonentity\". Perhaps that the apparent weakness of Cleomenes inspired the negative opinion of the hereditary kingship at Sparta expressed by Aristotle in his Politics (written between 336 and 322). However, Cleomenes may have focused on internal politics within Sparta, because military duties were apparently given to the Eurypontid Agesilaus II (r.\u2009400\u2013c.360), Archidamus III (r.\u2009360\u2013338), and Agis III (r.\u2009338\u2013331). As the Spartans notably kept their policies secret from foreign eyes, it would explain the silence of ancient sources on Cleomenes. Another explanation is that his duties were assumed by his elder son Acrotatus, described as a military leader by Diodorus, who mentions him in the aftermath of the Battle of Megalopolis in 331, and again in 315.Cleomenes' only known deed was his chariot race victory at the Pythian Games in Delphi in 336. In the following autumn, he gave the small sum of 510 drachmas for the reconstruction of the Temple of Apollo at Delphi, which had been destroyed by an earthquake in 373. Cleomenes might have made this gift as a pretext to go to Delphi and engage in informal diplomacy with other Greek states, possibly to discuss the consequences of the recent assassination of the Macedonian king Philip II.One short witticism of Cleomenes regarding cockfighting is preserved in the Moralia, written by the philosopher Plutarch in the early 2nd century AD:\nSomebody promised to give to Cleomenes cocks that would die fighting, but he retorted, \"No, don't, but give me those that kill fighting.\"\nAs Acrotatus died before Cleomenes, the latter's grandson Areus I succeeded him while still very young, so Cleomenes' second son Cleonymus acted as regent until Areus' majority. Some modern scholars also give Cleomenes a daughter named Archidamia, who played an important role during Pyrrhus' invasion of the Peloponnese, but the age difference makes it unlikely.\nPassage 7:\nYasuichi Oshima\nYasuichi Oshima (\u5927\u5cf6 \u3084\u3059\u3044\u3061, \u014cshima Yasuichi, born 24 March 1954 in Kyoto) is a Japanese manga artist.

He was briefly adopted into the Nomura family and became known as Nomura Yakichi, though he was later restored to the Inoue family.\nMasaru Inoue was brought up as the son of a samurai belonging to the Ch\u014dsh\u016b fief. At 15, he entered the Nagasaki Naval Academy established by the Tokugawa shogunate under the direction of a Dutch naval officer. In 1863, Inoue and four friends from the Ch\u014dsh\u016b clan stowed away on a vessel to the United Kingdom. He studied civil engineering and mining at University College London and returned to Japan in 1868. After working for the government as a technical officer supervising the mining industry, he was appointed Director of the Railway Board in 1871. Inoue played a leading role in Japan's railway planning and construction, including the construction of the Nakasendo Railway, the selection of the alternative route (Tokaido), and the proposals for future mainline railway networks.In 1891 Masaru Inoue founded Koiwai Farm with Yanosuke Iwasaki and Shin Onogi.  After retirement from the government, Inoue founded Kisha Seizo Kaisha, the first locomotive manufacturer in Japan, becoming its first president in 1896. In 1909 he was appointed President of the Imperial Railway Association. He died of an illness in London in 1910, during an official visit on behalf of the Ministry of Railways.\n\nHonors\nInoue and his friends later came to be known as the Ch\u014dsh\u016b Five. To commemorate their stay in London, two scholarships, known as the Inoue Masaru Scholarships, are available each session under the University College London 1863 Japan Scholarships scheme to enable University College students to study at a Japanese University. The value of the scholarships are \u00a33000 each.\nHis tomb is in the triangular area of land where the T\u014dkaid\u014d Main Line meets the T\u014dkaid\u014d Shinkansen in Kita-Shinagawa.\n\nCh\u014dsh\u016b Five\nThese are the four other members of the \"Ch\u014dsh\u016b Five\":\n\nIt\u014d Shunsuke (later It\u014d Hirobumii)\nInoue Monta (later Inoue Kaoru)\nYamao Y\u014dz\u014d who later studied engineering at the Andersonian Institute, Glasgow, 1866-68 while working at the shipyards by day\nEnd\u014d Kinsuke\n\nSee also\nJapanese students in Britain\nStatue of Inoue Masaru\nPassage 6:\nCleomenes II\nCleomenes II (Greek: \u039a\u03bb\u03b5\u03bf\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03b7\u03c2; died 309 BC) was king of Sparta from 370 to 309 BC. He was the second son of Cleombrotus I, and grandfather of Areus I, who succeeded him. Although he reigned for more than 60 years, his life is completely unknown, apart from a victory at the Pythian Games in 336 BC. Several theories have been suggested by modern historians to explain such inactivity, but none has gained consensus.\n\nLife and reign\nCleomenes was the second son of king Cleombrotus I (r.\u2009380\u2013371), who belonged to the Agiad dynasty, one of the two royal families of Sparta (the other being the Eurypontids). Cleombrotus died fighting Thebes at the famous Battle of Leuctra in 371. His eldest son Agesipolis II succeeded him, but he died soon after in 370. Cleomenes' reign was instead exceptionally long, lasting 60 years and 10 months according to Diodorus of Sicily, a historian of the 1st century BC. In a second statement, Diodorus nevertheless tells that Cleomenes II reigned 34 years, but he confused him with his namesake Cleomenes I (r.\u2009524\u2013490).\n\nDespite the outstanding length of his reign, very little can be said about Cleomenes. He has been described by modern historians as a \"nonentity\". Perhaps that the apparent weakness of Cleomenes inspired the negative opinion of the hereditary kingship at Sparta expressed by Aristotle in his Politics (written between 336 and 322). However, Cleomenes may have focused on internal politics within Sparta, because military duties were apparently given to the Eurypontid Agesilaus II (r.\u2009400\u2013c.360), Archidamus III (r.\u2009360\u2013338), and Agis III (r.\u2009338\u2013331). As the Spartans notably kept their policies secret from foreign eyes, it would explain the silence of ancient sources on Cleomenes. Another explanation is that his duties were assumed by his elder son Acrotatus, described as a military leader by Diodorus, who mentions him in the aftermath of the Battle of Megalopolis in 331, and again in 315.Cleomenes' only known deed was his chariot race victory at the Pythian Games in Delphi in 336. In the following autumn, he gave the small sum of 510 drachmas for the reconstruction of the Temple of Apollo at Delphi, which had been destroyed by an earthquake in 373. Cleomenes might have made this gift as a pretext to go to Delphi and engage in informal diplomacy with other Greek states, possibly to discuss the consequences of the recent assassination of the Macedonian king Philip II.One short witticism of Cleomenes regarding cockfighting is preserved in the Moralia, written by the philosopher Plutarch in the early 2nd century AD:\nSomebody promised to give to Cleomenes cocks that would die fighting, but he retorted, \"No, don't, but give me those that kill fighting.\"\nAs Acrotatus died before Cleomenes, the latter's grandson Areus I succeeded him while still very young, so Cleomenes' second son Cleonymus acted as regent until Areus' majority. Some modern scholars also give Cleomenes a daughter named Archidamia, who played an important role during Pyrrhus' invasion of the Peloponnese, but the age difference makes it unlikely.\nPassage 7:\nYasuichi Oshima\nYasuichi Oshima (\u5927\u5cf6 \u3084\u3059\u3044\u3061, \u014cshima Yasuichi, born 24 March 1954 in Kyoto) is a Japanese manga artist.

According to folklore gypsies are descendants of an Egyptian pharaoh. In the film, actors are dressed in ancient Egyptian costumes as they dance to flamenco music. As the story continues, the gypsies are run out of their lands and are forced to live nomadic lives, stealing and thieving as a means to survive. The Monty Pythonesque history lesson then continues to present the protagonists\u2019 ancestors and the scene that drives the rest of the film: Trinidad\u2019s (Lola Flores) ancestor places a spell on Enrique\u2019s (Fernando Fern\u00e1n G\u00f3mez) ancestor that will cause his descendant to fall in madly in love with her descendant.\nThe story continues to the present day, that is to say the 1950s, where Trinidad and her uncle Regalito (Miguel Ligero) are charged with stealing six hams from a shop window. This scene presents some of the most entertaining banter in the entire film as Trinidad and Regalito argue their innocence with very matter-of-fact language and mannerisms common to Andalusian gypsies. Their witty mockery, while creating uproars of laughter from the courtroom audience, causes the judges to grow more infuriated with the pair. It is then that Enrique, a lawyer, steps in to defend Trinidad and Regalito. After much deliberation, the two gypsies, after having to pay a fee, are set free.\nThe fee they are required to pay forces Trinidad to find employment. Coincidentally, she finds a job as a maid in Seville at the home of Enrique, the lawyer. Instead of dismissing Trinidad, Enrique decides to make her part of an experiment he plans to conduct. His experiment is to see if he can turn Trinidad from a thieving gypsy into a functioning member of Spanish society. He plans to track change in his Pygmalion-like experiment by playing a song and seeing how she reacts to it. The more refined she becomes, the less she should react to the folkloric music. Trinidad\u2019s reaction to Enrique\u2019s statement, while humorous, presents the moral of the story: she tells him that the spirit of a gypsy is something that no one can tame and that, even though she will try because he has asked her to do this for him, it is an impossible task. Fitted with new, modern clothing, Trinidad\u2019s reaction to the music is a romping performance full of beautiful arm movements and earth-shaking stomps. Trinidad\u2019s performance is so spell binding that, not only is Enrique entranced, but her impromptu tune is so catchy that he hums along to it the very next morning.\nAs the months go by, Enrique\u2019s experiment grows more futile as Trinidad\u2019s charisma wins him over. As Enrique\u2019s coworker sees how entranced he has become by her, he plots to convince Trinidad to leave with the pretense that Enrique\u2019s career might be jeopardized by her presence in his household. Trinidad instantly decides to leave as the last thing she wants to do is hurt Enrique. She makes the decision to say goodbye to him by performing a song dedicated to him. In an emotionally driven performance, Trinidad performs a powerful rendition of \u201cTe Lo Juro Yo,\u201d quickly leaving as soon as the song is done.\nIn the end, Enrique tracks down Trinidad and declares his love for her.\n\nCast\nLola Flores\nFernando Fern\u00e1n G\u00f3mez\nMiguel Ligero\nManuel Luna\nJulia Lajos\nAna Mariscal\nJulia Caba Alba\nFrancisco Pierr\u00e1\n\nThemes\nMorena Clara, while primarily a comedic movie, deals with issues such as poverty, sexism, socioeconomic discrimination against gypsies, dispelling of the gypsy stereotype, and of course, love.\n\nAnswer the question based on the given passages.

Palmer's rendition of the song \"O mein Papa\" became a major hit.

It was made at the Bavaria Studios in Munich and on location in Switzerland. The film's sets were designed by the art director Werner Schlichting.\nIt is a circus film set at the beginning of the twentieth century.\n\nCast\nPassage 10:\nMorena Clara\nMorena Clara is a 1954 film directed by Luis Lucia starring Lola Flores and Fernando Fern\u00e1n G\u00f3mez.\n\nPlot\nThe film begins by depicting the fabled tale of how the gypsies came to be. According to folklore gypsies are descendants of an Egyptian pharaoh. In the film, actors are dressed in ancient Egyptian costumes as they dance to flamenco music. As the story continues, the gypsies are run out of their lands and are forced to live nomadic lives, stealing and thieving as a means to survive. The Monty Pythonesque history lesson then continues to present the protagonists\u2019 ancestors and the scene that drives the rest of the film: Trinidad\u2019s (Lola Flores) ancestor places a spell on Enrique\u2019s (Fernando Fern\u00e1n G\u00f3mez) ancestor that will cause his descendant to fall in madly in love with her descendant.\nThe story continues to the present day, that is to say the 1950s, where Trinidad and her uncle Regalito (Miguel Ligero) are charged with stealing six hams from a shop window. This scene presents some of the most entertaining banter in the entire film as Trinidad and Regalito argue their innocence with very matter-of-fact language and mannerisms common to Andalusian gypsies. Their witty mockery, while creating uproars of laughter from the courtroom audience, causes the judges to grow more infuriated with the pair. It is then that Enrique, a lawyer, steps in to defend Trinidad and Regalito. After much deliberation, the two gypsies, after having to pay a fee, are set free.\nThe fee they are required to pay forces Trinidad to find employment. Coincidentally, she finds a job as a maid in Seville at the home of Enrique, the lawyer. Instead of dismissing Trinidad, Enrique decides to make her part of an experiment he plans to conduct. His experiment is to see if he can turn Trinidad from a thieving gypsy into a functioning member of Spanish society. He plans to track change in his Pygmalion-like experiment by playing a song and seeing how she reacts to it. The more refined she becomes, the less she should react to the folkloric music. Trinidad\u2019s reaction to Enrique\u2019s statement, while humorous, presents the moral of the story: she tells him that the spirit of a gypsy is something that no one can tame and that, even though she will try because he has asked her to do this for him, it is an impossible task. Fitted with new, modern clothing, Trinidad\u2019s reaction to the music is a romping performance full of beautiful arm movements and earth-shaking stomps. Trinidad\u2019s performance is so spell binding that, not only is Enrique entranced, but her impromptu tune is so catchy that he hums along to it the very next morning.\nAs the months go by, Enrique\u2019s experiment grows more futile as Trinidad\u2019s charisma wins him over. As Enrique\u2019s coworker sees how entranced he has become by her, he plots to convince Trinidad to leave with the pretense that Enrique\u2019s career might be jeopardized by her presence in his household. Trinidad instantly decides to leave as the last thing she wants to do is hurt Enrique. She makes the decision to say goodbye to him by performing a song dedicated to him. In an emotionally driven performance, Trinidad performs a powerful rendition of \u201cTe Lo Juro Yo,\u201d quickly leaving as soon as the song is done.\nIn the end, Enrique tracks down Trinidad and declares his love for her.\n\nCast\nLola Flores\nFernando Fern\u00e1n G\u00f3mez\nMiguel Ligero\nManuel Luna\nJulia Lajos\nAna Mariscal\nJulia Caba Alba\nFrancisco Pierr\u00e1\n\nThemes\nMorena Clara, while primarily a comedic movie, deals with issues such as poverty, sexism, socioeconomic discrimination against gypsies, dispelling of the gypsy stereotype, and of course, love.", "answers": ["yes"], "length": 2436, "dataset": "2wikimqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "8e5c5292e42825f60d52f62ffc53006513725eb27a831c48", "pred": " No. The Bloom Of Yesterday is from Germany, while Fireworks (1954 Film) is from West Germany."}

The family moved to the United States when he was seven years old on December 4, 1892, by ferry from Windsor to Detroit, according to his naturalization petition of August 1939. His elder brother, Leo Garnet Dwan (1883\u20131964), became a physician.\nAllan Dwan studied engineering at the University of Notre Dame and then worked for a lighting company in Chicago. He had a strong interest in the fledgling motion picture industry, and when Essanay Studios offered him the opportunity to become a scriptwriter, he took the job. At that time, some of the East Coast movie makers began to spend winters in California where the climate allowed them to continue productions requiring warm weather. Soon, a number of movie companies worked there year-round, and in 1911, Dwan began working part-time in Hollywood. While still in New York, in 1917 he was the founding president of the East Coast chapter of the Motion Picture Directors Association.\n\nCareer\nDwan started his directing career by accident in 1911, when he was sent by his employers to California, in order to locate a company that had vanished. Dwan managed to track the company down, and learned that they were waiting for the film's director (who was an alcoholic) to return from a binge (and allowing them to return to work). Dwan wired back to his employers in Chicago, informing them of the situation, and suggested that they disband the company. They wired back, instructing Dwan to direct the film. When Dwan informed the company of the situation, and that their jobs were on the line, they responded: \"You're the best damn director we ever saw\".Dwan operated Flying A Studios in La Mesa, California, from August 1911 to July 1912. Flying A was one of the first motion pictures studios in California history. On August 12, 2011, a plaque was unveiled on the Wolff building at Third Avenue and La Mesa Boulevard commemorating Dwan and the Flying A Studios origins in La Mesa, California.\nAfter making a series of westerns and comedies, Dwan directed fellow Canadian-American Mary Pickford in several very successful movies as well as her husband, Douglas Fairbanks, notably in the acclaimed 1922 Robin Hood. Dwan directed Gloria Swanson in eight feature films, and one short film made in the short-lived sound-on-film process Phonofilm. This short, also featuring Thomas Meighan and Henri de la Falaise, was produced as a joke, for the April 26, 1925 \"Lambs' Gambol\" for The Lambs, with the film showing Swanson crashing the all-male club.\nFollowing the introduction of the talkies, Dwan directed child-star Shirley Temple in Heidi (1937) and Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm (1938).\nDwan helped launch the career of two other successful Hollywood directors, Victor Fleming, who went on to direct The Wizard of Oz and Gone With the Wind, and Marshall Neilan, who became an actor, director, writer and producer. Over a long career spanning almost 50 years, Dwan directed 125 motion pictures, some of which were highly acclaimed, such as the 1949 box office hit, Sands of Iwo Jima. He directed his last movie in 1961.Being one of the last surviving pioneers of the cinema, he was interviewed at length for the 1980 documentary series Hollywood.He died in Los Angeles at the age of 96, and is interred in the San Fernando Mission Cemetery, Mission Hills, California.\nDwan has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6263 Hollywood Boulevard.\nDaniel Eagan of Film Journal International described Dwan as one of the early pioneers of cinema, stating that his style \"is so basic as to seem invisible, but he treats his characters with uncommon sympathy and compassion.\"\n\nPartial filmography as director\nSee also\nCanadian pioneers in early Hollywood\nPassage 5:\nSaintly Sinners\nSaintly Sinners is a 1962 American comedy-drama film directed by Jean Yarbrough and starring Don Beddoe, Ellen Corby, Stanley Clements and Paul Bryar.\n\nPlot\nEx-con Joseph Braden has his car temporarily stolen by a pair of bank robbers who hide their loot in the vehicle's spare tire.

He directed a version of The Unknown Soldier in 1985, 30 years after Edvin Laine directed the original version of it. Mollberg's movie's plot was same as Laine's movie. But Mollberg used unknown actors and the movie was colourised and shot by a handhold camera.Mollberg did not begin directing films for the cinema until he was well into his forties. He made a notable splash on the international festival circuit in 1974 with The Earth Is A Sinful Song (1973), his debut feature, an earthy, erotically-charged, blood-soaked tale of a young village girl's ill-fated affair with a Lapp reindeer herdsman. Based on a novel by the late Timo K. Mukka, one of Finland's most controversial young writers, the film \"stunned Scandinavian critics and audiences alike with its simple, terrible power and its authentic sensuality\" (Peter Cowie), and went on to become one of the biggest box-office successes in the Finnish cinema's history. It also introduced Mollberg's trademark style: \"a realistic naturalism full of expressive force with which he merges the people with the scenery, stripping them bare of life's illusions and the polished veneer of culture\" (Sakari Toiviainen). Despite Peter Cowie's efforts, and the acclaim of many other critics and \"independent\" festivals, The Finnish National Film board has stubbornly sequestered this masterpiece, only releasing it in a DVD format incompatible with international viewing, and lacking English subtitles.\nDuring his career he was used to get wide audiences in Finland. His film The Earth is a Sinful Song (1973) sold 709,664 tickets and it is 11th on the list of most admissions to a Finnish film. 590,271 tickets were sold for the screenings of The Unknown Soldier (1985) making it the 17th highest-grossing movie in the history of Finland.\n\nAwards and nominations\nBerlin International Film Festival: Nominated for Golden Bear (1974 and 1981 for films The Earth is a Sinful Song and Milka).\nLocarno International Film Festival: Won Special prize for The Earth is a Sinful Song (1974).\nNapoli Film Festival: Won Best Director award for Pretty Good for a Human (1978).\nJussi Awards: Best Director award for Sotaerakko (1973), The Earth is a Sinful Song (1974), Pretty Good for a Human (1978), The Unknown Soldier (1986), Best Producer award for Milka (1981).\n\nFilmography\n\"Lapsuuteni\", 1967\nTehtaan varjossa, 1969\nSotaerakko, 1972\nMaa on syntinen laulu, 1973\nAika hyv\u00e4 ihmiseksi, 1977\nMilka \u2013 elokuva tabuista, 1980\nTuntematon sotilas, 1985\nYst\u00e4v\u00e4t, toverit, 1990\nParatiisin lapset, 1994\nTaustan Mikon kotiinpaluu, 1999\nIson miehen vierailu, 1999\nPuu kulkee, 2000\nHeikuraisen Nauru, 2001\nKorpisen veljekset, 2002\nReissu, 2004\nPassage 7:\nLa Bestia humana\nLa Bestia humana is a 1957 Argentine film whose story is based on the 1890 novel La B\u00eate Humaine by the French writer \u00c9mile Zola.\n\nExternal links\nLa Bestia humana at IMDb\nPassage 8:\nOhimai Amaize\nOhimai Amaize (born 9 September 1984) is a Nigerian journalist with a multi-sectoral background that spans anti-corruption, youth advocacy, civil society, political campaigns, brand development, communications strategy and governance.He was producer and anchor of Kakaaki Social \u2013 a popular social media news program on Africa Independent Television (AIT) \u2013 Nigeria's largest privately owned television network.

The family moved to the United States when he was seven years old on December 4, 1892, by ferry from Windsor to Detroit, according to his naturalization petition of August 1939. His elder brother, Leo Garnet Dwan (1883\u20131964), became a physician.\nAllan Dwan studied engineering at the University of Notre Dame and then worked for a lighting company in Chicago. He had a strong interest in the fledgling motion picture industry, and when Essanay Studios offered him the opportunity to become a scriptwriter, he took the job. At that time, some of the East Coast movie makers began to spend winters in California where the climate allowed them to continue productions requiring warm weather. Soon, a number of movie companies worked there year-round, and in 1911, Dwan began working part-time in Hollywood. While still in New York, in 1917 he was the founding president of the East Coast chapter of the Motion Picture Directors Association.\n\nCareer\nDwan started his directing career by accident in 1911, when he was sent by his employers to California, in order to locate a company that had vanished. Dwan managed to track the company down, and learned that they were waiting for the film's director (who was an alcoholic) to return from a binge (and allowing them to return to work). Dwan wired back to his employers in Chicago, informing them of the situation, and suggested that they disband the company. They wired back, instructing Dwan to direct the film. When Dwan informed the company of the situation, and that their jobs were on the line, they responded: \"You're the best damn director we ever saw\".Dwan operated Flying A Studios in La Mesa, California, from August 1911 to July 1912. Flying A was one of the first motion pictures studios in California history. On August 12, 2011, a plaque was unveiled on the Wolff building at Third Avenue and La Mesa Boulevard commemorating Dwan and the Flying A Studios origins in La Mesa, California.\nAfter making a series of westerns and comedies, Dwan directed fellow Canadian-American Mary Pickford in several very successful movies as well as her husband, Douglas Fairbanks, notably in the acclaimed 1922 Robin Hood. Dwan directed Gloria Swanson in eight feature films, and one short film made in the short-lived sound-on-film process Phonofilm. This short, also featuring Thomas Meighan and Henri de la Falaise, was produced as a joke, for the April 26, 1925 \"Lambs' Gambol\" for The Lambs, with the film showing Swanson crashing the all-male club.\nFollowing the introduction of the talkies, Dwan directed child-star Shirley Temple in Heidi (1937) and Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm (1938).\nDwan helped launch the career of two other successful Hollywood directors, Victor Fleming, who went on to direct The Wizard of Oz and Gone With the Wind, and Marshall Neilan, who became an actor, director, writer and producer. Over a long career spanning almost 50 years, Dwan directed 125 motion pictures, some of which were highly acclaimed, such as the 1949 box office hit, Sands of Iwo Jima. He directed his last movie in 1961.Being one of the last surviving pioneers of the cinema, he was interviewed at length for the 1980 documentary series Hollywood.He died in Los Angeles at the age of 96, and is interred in the San Fernando Mission Cemetery, Mission Hills, California.\nDwan has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6263 Hollywood Boulevard.\nDaniel Eagan of Film Journal International described Dwan as one of the early pioneers of cinema, stating that his style \"is so basic as to seem invisible, but he treats his characters with uncommon sympathy and compassion.\"\n\nPartial filmography as director\nSee also\nCanadian pioneers in early Hollywood\nPassage 5:\nSaintly Sinners\nSaintly Sinners is a 1962 American comedy-drama film directed by Jean Yarbrough and starring Don Beddoe, Ellen Corby, Stanley Clements and Paul Bryar.\n\nPlot\nEx-con Joseph Braden has his car temporarily stolen by a pair of bank robbers who hide their loot in the vehicle's spare tire.

He directed a version of The Unknown Soldier in 1985, 30 years after Edvin Laine directed the original version of it. Mollberg's movie's plot was same as Laine's movie. But Mollberg used unknown actors and the movie was colourised and shot by a handhold camera.Mollberg did not begin directing films for the cinema until he was well into his forties. He made a notable splash on the international festival circuit in 1974 with The Earth Is A Sinful Song (1973), his debut feature, an earthy, erotically-charged, blood-soaked tale of a young village girl's ill-fated affair with a Lapp reindeer herdsman. Based on a novel by the late Timo K. Mukka, one of Finland's most controversial young writers, the film \"stunned Scandinavian critics and audiences alike with its simple, terrible power and its authentic sensuality\" (Peter Cowie), and went on to become one of the biggest box-office successes in the Finnish cinema's history. It also introduced Mollberg's trademark style: \"a realistic naturalism full of expressive force with which he merges the people with the scenery, stripping them bare of life's illusions and the polished veneer of culture\" (Sakari Toiviainen). Despite Peter Cowie's efforts, and the acclaim of many other critics and \"independent\" festivals, The Finnish National Film board has stubbornly sequestered this masterpiece, only releasing it in a DVD format incompatible with international viewing, and lacking English subtitles.\nDuring his career he was used to get wide audiences in Finland. His film The Earth is a Sinful Song (1973) sold 709,664 tickets and it is 11th on the list of most admissions to a Finnish film. 590,271 tickets were sold for the screenings of The Unknown Soldier (1985) making it the 17th highest-grossing movie in the history of Finland.\n\nAwards and nominations\nBerlin International Film Festival: Nominated for Golden Bear (1974 and 1981 for films The Earth is a Sinful Song and Milka).\nLocarno International Film Festival: Won Special prize for The Earth is a Sinful Song (1974).\nNapoli Film Festival: Won Best Director award for Pretty Good for a Human (1978).\nJussi Awards: Best Director award for Sotaerakko (1973), The Earth is a Sinful Song (1974), Pretty Good for a Human (1978), The Unknown Soldier (1986), Best Producer award for Milka (1981).\n\nFilmography\n\"Lapsuuteni\", 1967\nTehtaan varjossa, 1969\nSotaerakko, 1972\nMaa on syntinen laulu, 1973\nAika hyv\u00e4 ihmiseksi, 1977\nMilka \u2013 elokuva tabuista, 1980\nTuntematon sotilas, 1985\nYst\u00e4v\u00e4t, toverit, 1990\nParatiisin lapset, 1994\nTaustan Mikon kotiinpaluu, 1999\nIson miehen vierailu, 1999\nPuu kulkee, 2000\nHeikuraisen Nauru, 2001\nKorpisen veljekset, 2002\nReissu, 2004\nPassage 7:\nLa Bestia humana\nLa Bestia humana is a 1957 Argentine film whose story is based on the 1890 novel La B\u00eate Humaine by the French writer \u00c9mile Zola.\n\nExternal links\nLa Bestia humana at IMDb\nPassage 8:\nOhimai Amaize\nOhimai Amaize (born 9 September 1984) is a Nigerian journalist with a multi-sectoral background that spans anti-corruption, youth advocacy, civil society, political campaigns, brand development, communications strategy and governance.He was producer and anchor of Kakaaki Social \u2013 a popular social media news program on Africa Independent Television (AIT) \u2013 Nigeria's largest privately owned television network.

He was the director of the Peabody Essex Museum in Salem for 17 months, resigning December 31, 2020. He was the director of the Toledo Museum of Art in Ohio from 2010 to 2019. He was the director of the Hood Museum of Art from 2005 to 2010, and the National Gallery of Australia (Canberra) from 1997 to 2004.\n\nCareer\nBrian Kennedy currently lives and works in the United States after leaving Australia in 2005 to direct the Hood Museum of Art at Dartmouth College. In October 2010 he became the ninth Director of the Toledo Museum of Art. On 1 July 2019, he succeeded Dan Monroe as the executive director and CEO of the Peabody Essex Museum.\n\nEarly life and career in Ireland\nKennedy was born in Dublin and attended Clonkeen College. He received B.A. (1982), M.A. (1985) and PhD (1989) degrees from University College-Dublin, where he studied both art history and history.\nHe worked in the Irish Department of Education (1982), the European Commission, Brussels (1983), and in Ireland at the Chester Beatty Library (1983\u201385), Government Publications Office (1985\u201386), and Department of Finance (1986\u201389). He married Mary Fiona Carlin in 1988.He was Assistant Director at the National Gallery of Ireland in Dublin from 1989 to 1997. He was Chair of the Irish Association of Art Historians from 1996 to 1997, and of the Council of Australian Art Museum Directors from 2001 to 2003. In September 1997 he became Director of the National Gallery of Australia.\n\nNational Gallery of Australia (NGA)\nKennedy expanded the traveling exhibitions and loans program throughout Australia, arranged for several major shows of Australian art abroad, increased the number of exhibitions at the museum itself and oversaw the development of an extensive multi-media site.  Although he oversaw several years of the museum's highest ever annual visitation, he discontinued the emphasis of his predecessor, Betty Churcher, on showing \"blockbuster\" exhibitions.\nDuring his directorship, the NGA gained government support for improving the building and significant private donations and corporate sponsorship. However, the initial design for the building proved controversial generating a public dispute with the original architect on moral rights grounds.  As a result, the project was not delivered during Dr Kennedy's tenure, with a significantly altered design completed some years later.  Private funding supported two acquisitions of British art, including David Hockney's A Bigger Grand Canyon in 1999, and Lucian Freud's After C\u00e9zanne in 2001. Kennedy built on the established collections at the museum by acquiring the Holmgren-Spertus collection of Indonesian textiles; the Kenneth Tyler collection of editioned prints, screens, multiples and unique proofs; and the Australian Print Workshop Archive. He was also notable for campaigning for the construction of a new \"front\" entrance to the Gallery, facing King Edward Terrace, which was completed in 2010 (see reference to the building project above).\nKennedy's cancellation of the \"Sensation exhibition\" (scheduled at the NGA from 2 June 2000 to 13 August 2000) was controversial, and seen by some as censorship. He claimed that the decision was due to the exhibition being \"too close to the market\" implying that a national cultural institution cannot exhibit the private collection of a speculative art investor. However, there were other exhibitions at the NGA during his tenure, which could have raised similar concerns. The exhibition featured the privately owned Young British Artists works belonging to Charles Saatchi and attracted large attendances in London and Brooklyn. Its most controversial work was Chris Ofili's The Holy Virgin Mary, a painting which used elephant dung and was accused of being blasphemous. The then-mayor of New York, Rudolph Giuliani, campaigned against the exhibition, claiming it was \"Catholic-bashing\" and an \"aggressive, vicious, disgusting attack on religion.\" In November 1999, Kennedy cancelled the exhibition and stated that the events in New York had \"obscured discussion of the artistic merit of the works of art\". He has said that it \"was the toughest decision of my professional life, so far.\"Kennedy was also repeatedly questioned on his management of a range of issues during the Australian Government's Senate Estimates process - particularly on the NGA's occupational health and safety record and concerns about the NGA's twenty-year-old air-conditioning system. The air-conditioning was finally renovated in 2003. Kennedy announced in 2002 that he would not seek extension of his contract beyond 2004, accepting a seven-year term as had his two predecessors.He became a joint Irish-Australian citizen in 2003.\n\nToledo Museum of Art\nThe Toledo Museum of Art is known for its exceptional collections of European and American paintings and sculpture, glass, antiquities, artist books, Japanese prints and netsuke. The museum offers free admission and is recognized for its historical leadership in the field of art education.  During his tenure, Kennedy has focused the museum's art education efforts on visual literacy, which he defines as \"learning to read, understand and write visual language.\"   Initiatives have included baby and toddler tours, specialized training for all staff, docents, volunteers and the launch of a website, www.vislit.org. In November 2014, the museum hosted the International Visual Literacy Association (IVLA) conference, the first Museum to do so. Kennedy has been a frequent speaker on the topic, including 2010 and 2013 TEDx talks on visual and sensory literacy.\nKennedy has expressed an interest in expanding the museum's collection of contemporary art and art by indigenous peoples. Works by Frank Stella, Sean Scully, Jaume Plensa, Ravinder Reddy and Mary Sibande have been acquired.  In addition, the museum has made major acquisitions of Old Master paintings by Frans Hals and Luca Giordano.During his tenure the Toledo Museum of Art has announced the return of several objects from its collection due to claims the objects were stolen and/or illegally exported prior being sold to the museum.  In 2011 a Meissen sweetmeat stand was returned to Germany followed by an Etruscan Kalpis or water jug to Italy (2013), an Indian sculpture of Ganesha (2014) and an astrological compendium to Germany in 2015.\n\nHood Museum of Art\nKennedy became Director of the Hood Museum of Art in July 2005. During his tenure, he implemented a series of large and small-scale exhibitions and oversaw the production of more than 20 publications to bring greater public attention to the museum's remarkable collections of the arts of America, Europe, Africa, Papua New Guinea and the Polar regions. At 70,000 objects, the Hood has one of the largest collections on any American college of university campus. The exhibition, Black Womanhood: Images, Icons, and Ideologies of the African Body, toured several US venues. Kennedy increased campus curricular use of works of art, with thousands of objects pulled from storage for classes annually. Numerous acquisitions were made with the museum's generous endowments, and he curated several exhibitions: including Wenda Gu: Forest of Stone Steles: Retranslation and Rewriting Tang Dynasty Poetry, Sean Scully: The Art of the Stripe, and Frank Stella: Irregular Polygons.\n\nPublications\nKennedy has written or edited a number of books on art, including:\n\nAlfred Chester Beatty and Ireland 1950-1968: A study in cultural politics, Glendale Press (1988), ISBN 978-0-907606-49-9\nDreams and responsibilities: The state and arts in independent Ireland, Arts Council of Ireland (1990), ISBN 978-0-906627-32-7\nJack B Yeats: Jack Butler Yeats, 1871-1957 (Lives of Irish Artists), Unipub (October 1991), ISBN 978-0-948524-24-0\nThe Anatomy Lesson: Art and Medicine (with Davis Coakley), National Gallery of Ireland (January 1992), ISBN 978-0-903162-65-4\nIreland: Art into History (with Raymond Gillespie), Roberts Rinehart Publishers (1994), ISBN 978-1-57098-005-3\nIrish Painting, Roberts Rinehart Publishers (November 1997),  ISBN 978-1-86059-059-7\nSean Scully: The Art of the Stripe, Hood Museum of Art (October 2008), ISBN 978-0-944722-34-3\nFrank Stella: Irregular Polygons, 1965-1966, Hood Museum of Art (October 2010), ISBN 978-0-944722-39-8\n\nHonors and achievements\nKennedy was awarded the Australian Centenary Medal in 2001 for service to Australian Society and its art. He is a trustee and treasurer of the Association of Art Museum Directors, a peer reviewer for the American Association of Museums and a member of the International Association of Art Critics. In 2013 he was appointed inaugural eminent professor at the University of Toledo and received an honorary doctorate from Lourdes University. Most recently, Kennedy received the 2014 Northwest Region, Ohio Art Education Association award for distinguished educator for art education.\n\n\n== Notes ==\nPassage 9:\nLarry Kent (filmmaker)\nLaurence Lionel \"Larry\" Kent (born May 16, 1937, in Johannesburg, South Africa) is a Canadian filmmaker, who is regarded as an important pioneer of independent filmmaking in Canada.\n\nBiography\nLarry Kent emigrated from South Africa to Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada in 1957 to study psychology and theatre at the University of British Columbia.A devout film buff and scholar, Kent made the transition from the stage to screen in the early 1960s. Kent wrote and directed the existential Canadian indie, post-beatnik, pre-hippie classic The Bitter Ash in 1962 and tirelessly toured the film despite the controversy it garnered nationwide. Filled with profanity and brief nudity, the picture was produced on a shoestring, shot silent with audio dubbed in later and featured a jazz music score.\nHis follow-up film, Sweet Substitute (1964) made money in the United States, a first for any Canadian independent picture. Together with his third picture, the proto-feminist film When Tomorrow Dies, these three movies comprise Kent's \"Vancouver Trilogy\".Kent moved to Montreal in the late 1960s, briefly working for the National Film Board of Canada before quitting to make films that exemplified the wild, drug informed spirit of the youth driven counterculture. His 1967 film High was slated to premiere at the Montreal International Film Festival, but was banned by the Quebec Censor Board at the last minute, while The Apprentice (1971) was one of the first films ever to directly address the linguistic and cultural tensions between anglophones and francophones in Montreal in that era.Although none of these early films received wide distribution, his cultural and critical esteem began to increase when several of them were included in Front & Centre, a retrospective program of historically significant Canadian films which screened at the 1984 Toronto International Film Festival. The Bitter Ash, Sweet Substitute, When Tomorrow Dies and High were also screened as a Kent retrospective at a number of venues in 2002 and 2003, including Cinematheque Ontario in Toronto, the Pacific Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que in Vancouver and the Canadian Film Institute in Ottawa.He also had occasional acting roles in other directors' films, including Q-Bec My Love (Un succ\u00e8s commercial) and One Man.During the 1970s and throughout the 1980s, Kent continued to explore various aspects of the human condition in his work. Though he slowed down in the 1990s, he returned in 2005 with The Hamster Cage, a black comedy/psychodrama which won the jury prize at the 2005 Austin Fantastic Fest.In 2007, Kent completed post-production work on Hastings Street, a 20-minute Vancouver drama which he had actually made in 1962 as his first-ever film but had never completed due to lack of funding.In 2023, he is slated to receive the Fantasia Film Festival's Trailblazer Award for distinguished career achievement.\n\nSelect filmography\nThe Bitter Ash (1963)\nSweet Substitute (1964)\nWhen Tomorrow Dies (1965)\nHigh (1967)\nFacade (1968)\nThe Apprentice (1971)\nKeep It in the Family (1973)\nThe Slavers (1977)\nYesterday (a.k.a.

Kent wrote and directed the existential Canadian indie, post-beatnik, pre-hippie classic The Bitter Ash in 1962 and tirelessly toured the film despite the controversy it garnered nationwide. Filled with profanity and brief nudity, the picture was produced on a shoestring, shot silent with audio dubbed in later and featured a jazz music score.\nHis follow-up film, Sweet Substitute (1964) made money in the United States, a first for any Canadian independent picture. Together with his third picture, the proto-feminist film When Tomorrow Dies, these three movies comprise Kent's \"Vancouver Trilogy\".Kent moved to Montreal in the late 1960s, briefly working for the National Film Board of Canada before quitting to make films that exemplified the wild, drug informed spirit of the youth driven counterculture. His 1967 film High was slated to premiere at the Montreal International Film Festival, but was banned by the Quebec Censor Board at the last minute, while The Apprentice (1971) was one of the first films ever to directly address the linguistic and cultural tensions between anglophones and francophones in Montreal in that era.Although none of these early films received wide distribution, his cultural and critical esteem began to increase when several of them were included in Front & Centre, a retrospective program of historically significant Canadian films which screened at the 1984 Toronto International Film Festival. The Bitter Ash, Sweet Substitute, When Tomorrow Dies and High were also screened as a Kent retrospective at a number of venues in 2002 and 2003, including Cinematheque Ontario in Toronto, the Pacific Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que in Vancouver and the Canadian Film Institute in Ottawa.He also had occasional acting roles in other directors' films, including Q-Bec My Love (Un succ\u00e8s commercial) and One Man.During the 1970s and throughout the 1980s, Kent continued to explore various aspects of the human condition in his work. Though he slowed down in the 1990s, he returned in 2005 with The Hamster Cage, a black comedy/psychodrama which won the jury prize at the 2005 Austin Fantastic Fest.In 2007, Kent completed post-production work on Hastings Street, a 20-minute Vancouver drama which he had actually made in 1962 as his first-ever film but had never completed due to lack of funding.In 2023, he is slated to receive the Fantasia Film Festival's Trailblazer Award for distinguished career achievement.\n\nSelect filmography\nThe Bitter Ash (1963)\nSweet Substitute (1964)\nWhen Tomorrow Dies (1965)\nHigh (1967)\nFacade (1968)\nThe Apprentice (1971)\nKeep It in the Family (1973)\nThe Slavers (1977)\nYesterday (a.k.a.

He is caught in a love triangle between Elaine (Angela Gann), a prim and proper girl who is saving herself for marriage, and Kathy (Carol Pastinsky), a more sexually available girl whom Tom impregnates.It was a Canadian Film Award nominee for Best Picture at the 17th Canadian Film Awards in 1965, but did not win.\nIt was part of a retrospective screening of Kent's films, alongside The Bitter Ash, When Tomorrow Dies and High, which screened at a number of venues in 2002 and 2003, including Cinematheque Ontario in Toronto, the Pacific Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que in Vancouver and the Canadian Film Institute in Ottawa.", "answers": ["Johannesburg, South Africa"], "length": 3223, "dataset": "2wikimqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "214b402d003800d93cac0719cd79368392a320201cef08c9", "pred": " Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada."}

The son of a German father and a Jewish mother, he was born in St. Pauli, the poorest part of Hamburg. Despite being of Jewish ancestry, Sch\u00fcnzel was allowed by the Nazis to continue making films for several years until he eventually left in 1937 to live abroad.\n\nLife in Germany\nReinhold Sch\u00fcnzel (or Schuenzel) started his career as an actor in 1915 with a role in the film Werner Krafft. He directed his first film in 1918's Mary Magdalene and in 1920 directed The Girl from Acker Street and Catherine the Great. He was one of Germany's best-known silent film stars after World War I, a period during which films were significantly influenced by the consequences of the war. Sch\u00fcnzel performed in both comedies and dramas, often appearing as a villain or a powerful and corrupt man.\nHe was influenced by filmmakers such as his mentor Richard Oswald and Ernst Lubitsch, for whom he worked as an actor in the film Madame Du Barry in 1919.\nSch\u00fcnzel's work was very popular in Germany and the Nazi regime gave him the title of Ehrenarier or Honorary Aryan, allowing him to continue to direct and act despite his Jewish heritage (his mother was Jewish). He found that the government, first under Kaiser Wilhelm II and later under Adolf Hitler, interfered with his film projects, compelling him to leave in 1937. Schuenzel described both the Kaiser and Hitler \"persons of recognized authority and the worst possible dramatic taste.\"\nMoving to the United States, he worked in Hollywood, playing Nazis and scientists. One of many examples was the film The Hitler Gang (1944), directed by John Farrow. Made in the style of a gangster film, it depicts the rise of Hitler from a small political adventurer to the dictator of Germany. Reinhold Sch\u00fcnzel played the role of General Erich Ludendorff.\n\nFamily\nSch\u00fcnzel had a daughter Marianne Stewart, who was born in Berlin, Germany and followed her father by becoming an actress. She appeared in Broadway plays and was known for The Facts of Life (1960), Hush...Hush, Sweet Charlotte (1964), and Time Table (1956).\n\nSch\u00fcnzel in the United States\nSch\u00fcnzel came to the United States in 1937, and began his American career in Hollywood at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Among the films he directed were Rich Man, Poor Girl (1938), Ice Follies (1939), Balalaika (1939), and New Wine (1941). He also acted in films like The Hitler Gang (1944), Dragonwyck (1946), and The Vicious Circle (1948), among others. His most memorable performance was as Dr. Anderson, a Nazi conspirator, in the film Notorious released in 1946. Sch\u00fcnzel went to New York in 1945 to make a debut on Broadway. He acted in Temper the Wind in 1946 and Montserrat in 1949.\nAmong the prizes he received was the Federal West German Film prize for the best supporting role in the movie My Father's Horses.\nHe became a U.S citizen in 1943 and he returned to Germany in 1949. Sch\u00fcnzel died of a heart attack in Munich, Germany. Before returning to Germany, he starred in the 1949 Clifford Odets Broadway play The Big Knife.\n\nFilmography\nGerman films\nAmerican films\nRich Man, Poor Girl (1938, director)\nThe Ice Follies of 1939 (1939, director)\nBalalaika (1939, director)\nThe Great Awakening (1941, director)\nHangmen Also Die!

Unbeknownst to the two lovers, Don Juan is watching them from one of the balconies. Horrified by the thought of Maria leaving him for Philippe, he calls upon his Jester servant for help. So that he can pay for a wedding, Juan sends the Fool into town to ask for money from the Mayor (Juan and Phillipe's father), under the false pretense that Juan needs the money to pay off medical bills. When Juan's father learns about his son's true intentions, he gives the Jester two coins so he and Juan can buy some rope to hang themselves with. Outraged by this, Don Juan murders his own father backstage and heads over to the garden where Maria and Philippe were planning to meet.\nMaria arrives shortly after, but is shocked to discover Don Juan there instead of her true love \u2014 Philippe. Demanding that she return his feelings or face the consequences, he chases after Maria but is stopped by her father, Don Vespis, who now realizes Juan is unfit to marry his daughter and threatens to have him arrested. Don Juan dispatches of Maria's father by cutting his face off, and as he lay dying, he swears his ghost will haunt Don Juan to exact his revenge.\nPhilippe soon discovers Maria mourning her dead father, and swears to avenge them both. He eventually finds Don Juan and the two engage in a duel which ends with Philippe's gory demise. The Jester then arrives to tell Juan that there is a spectral man who wants to speak with him in the cemetery. The man turns out to be the spirit of Maria's dead father, who warns Don Juan that his soul will be dragged to Hell at midnight.\nAs in the traditional Czech puppet plays, Juan urges children not to commit evil deeds like him.\nJuan's physical body keels over dead into an open grave, while his spirit is lowered into a trapdoor. Instead of being dragged into Hell as the legend suggests, the lifeless puppet merely falls into a compartment beneath the stage. Upon discovering an inanimate Don Juan, The Jester asks how he is going to get paid with his master dead.\nPassage 7:\nDon Juan in Hell (film)\nDon Juan in Hell (Spanish: Don Juan en los infiernos) is a 1991 Spanish drama film directed by Gonzalo Su\u00e1rez.

He was the son of the Reverend Edward Moore and Lady Harriet Janet Sarah Montagu-Scott, who was one of the daughters of the 4th Duke of Buccleuch. One of his brothers, Arthur, became an admiral and was knighted. Their great \ngrandfather was John Moore, Archbishop of Canterbury from 1783 to 1805. One of their sisters was a maid of honour to Queen Victoria.Moore went to New Zealand in the 1870s and lived in Geraldine and Christchurch. He married Henrietta Lysaght of H\u0101wera in November 1879, and they had one son. In May 1884 she died a few days after giving birth to a daughter, who also died.In 1886 Moore became a Justice of the Peace in Geraldine. In 1897 he married Alice Fish of Geraldine. They moved to England four years before his death in 1916.\n\nCricket career\nMoore was a right-handed middle-order batsman. In consecutive seasons, 1876\u201377 and 1877\u201378, playing for Canterbury, he made the highest score in the short New Zealand first-class season: 76 and 75 respectively. His 76 came in his first match for Canterbury, against Otago. He went to the wicket early on the first day with the score at 7 for 2 and put on 99 for the third wicket with Charles Corfe before he was out with the score at 106 for 3 after a \"very fine exhibition of free hitting, combined with good defence\". Canterbury were all out for 133, but went on to win the match. His 75 came in the next season's match against Otago, when he took the score from 22 for 2 to 136 for 6. The New Zealand cricket historian Tom Reese said, \"Right from the beginning he smote the bowling hip and thigh, going out of his ground to indulge in some forceful driving.\" Canterbury won again.Moore led the batting averages in the Canterbury Cricket Association in 1877\u201378 with 379 runs at an average of 34.4. Also in 1877\u201378, he was a member of the Canterbury team that inflicted the only defeat on the touring Australians. In 1896\u201397, at the age of 47, he top-scored in each innings for a South Canterbury XVIII against the touring Queensland cricket team.\nPassage 9:\nDon Juan in Sicily\nDon Giovanni in Sicilia, internationally released as Don Juan in Sicily, is a 1967 Italian comedy-drama film directed by Alberto Lattuada.

Unbeknownst to the two lovers, Don Juan is watching them from one of the balconies. Horrified by the thought of Maria leaving him for Philippe, he calls upon his Jester servant for help. So that he can pay for a wedding, Juan sends the Fool into town to ask for money from the Mayor (Juan and Phillipe's father), under the false pretense that Juan needs the money to pay off medical bills. When Juan's father learns about his son's true intentions, he gives the Jester two coins so he and Juan can buy some rope to hang themselves with. Outraged by this, Don Juan murders his own father backstage and heads over to the garden where Maria and Philippe were planning to meet.\nMaria arrives shortly after, but is shocked to discover Don Juan there instead of her true love \u2014 Philippe. Demanding that she return his feelings or face the consequences, he chases after Maria but is stopped by her father, Don Vespis, who now realizes Juan is unfit to marry his daughter and threatens to have him arrested. Don Juan dispatches of Maria's father by cutting his face off, and as he lay dying, he swears his ghost will haunt Don Juan to exact his revenge.\nPhilippe soon discovers Maria mourning her dead father, and swears to avenge them both. He eventually finds Don Juan and the two engage in a duel which ends with Philippe's gory demise. The Jester then arrives to tell Juan that there is a spectral man who wants to speak with him in the cemetery. The man turns out to be the spirit of Maria's dead father, who warns Don Juan that his soul will be dragged to Hell at midnight.\nAs in the traditional Czech puppet plays, Juan urges children not to commit evil deeds like him.\nJuan's physical body keels over dead into an open grave, while his spirit is lowered into a trapdoor. Instead of being dragged into Hell as the legend suggests, the lifeless puppet merely falls into a compartment beneath the stage. Upon discovering an inanimate Don Juan, The Jester asks how he is going to get paid with his master dead.\nPassage 7:\nDon Juan in Hell (film)\nDon Juan in Hell (Spanish: Don Juan en los infiernos) is a 1991 Spanish drama film directed by Gonzalo Su\u00e1rez.

He was the son of the Reverend Edward Moore and Lady Harriet Janet Sarah Montagu-Scott, who was one of the daughters of the 4th Duke of Buccleuch. One of his brothers, Arthur, became an admiral and was knighted. Their great \ngrandfather was John Moore, Archbishop of Canterbury from 1783 to 1805. One of their sisters was a maid of honour to Queen Victoria.Moore went to New Zealand in the 1870s and lived in Geraldine and Christchurch. He married Henrietta Lysaght of H\u0101wera in November 1879, and they had one son. In May 1884 she died a few days after giving birth to a daughter, who also died.In 1886 Moore became a Justice of the Peace in Geraldine. In 1897 he married Alice Fish of Geraldine. They moved to England four years before his death in 1916.\n\nCricket career\nMoore was a right-handed middle-order batsman. In consecutive seasons, 1876\u201377 and 1877\u201378, playing for Canterbury, he made the highest score in the short New Zealand first-class season: 76 and 75 respectively. His 76 came in his first match for Canterbury, against Otago. He went to the wicket early on the first day with the score at 7 for 2 and put on 99 for the third wicket with Charles Corfe before he was out with the score at 106 for 3 after a \"very fine exhibition of free hitting, combined with good defence\". Canterbury were all out for 133, but went on to win the match. His 75 came in the next season's match against Otago, when he took the score from 22 for 2 to 136 for 6. The New Zealand cricket historian Tom Reese said, \"Right from the beginning he smote the bowling hip and thigh, going out of his ground to indulge in some forceful driving.\" Canterbury won again.Moore led the batting averages in the Canterbury Cricket Association in 1877\u201378 with 379 runs at an average of 34.4. Also in 1877\u201378, he was a member of the Canterbury team that inflicted the only defeat on the touring Australians. In 1896\u201397, at the age of 47, he top-scored in each innings for a South Canterbury XVIII against the touring Queensland cricket team.\nPassage 9:\nDon Juan in Sicily\nDon Giovanni in Sicilia, internationally released as Don Juan in Sicily, is a 1967 Italian comedy-drama film directed by Alberto Lattuada.

Eric himself probably died on 21 December or 22 December 1508. He was buried in the Doberan Minster in Bad Doberan. He never married and died childless.\nPassage 3:\nJohn I, Duke of Mecklenburg-Stargard\nJohn I, Duke of Mecklenburg-Stargard (1326 \u2013 9 August 1392 or 9 February 1393), Duke of Mecklenburg from 1344 to 1352 and Duke of Mecklenburg-Stargard from 1352 to 1392.\n\nFamily\nHe was probably the youngest child from the second marriage of Lord Henry II \"the Lion\" of Mecklenburg and Anna of Saxe-Wittenberg, a daughter of Duke Albert II of Saxe-Wittenberg.\n\nLife\nJohn I was probably born in 1326.  His father died in 1329, and he remained under guardianship until 1344, when he came of age and began to carry a seal as a participant in the governance of Mecklenburg.  On 8 July 1348, Holy Roman Emperor Charles IV raised John and his brother Albert II to the rank of Duke in Prague.  John, Albert and Charles initially supported the False Waldemar, but in 1350 they reconciled with his supporter Duke Louis V of Bavaria.\nUpon the division of Mecklenburg on 25 November 1352, John was awarded the Lordships of Stargard, Sternbuerg and Ture.  He supported his nephew Albert III of Mecklenburg in his attempts to be recognized as King of Sweden.\n\nMarriages and issue\nJohn married three times. His first wife Rixa (background unknown) probably died soon after the wedding and the marriage remained childless.\nHis second wife Anna was a daughter of the count Adolf VII of Pinneberg and Schauenburg.  She probably died in 1358.  John and Anna had a daughter Anna, who married Wartislaw VI of Pomerania-Wolgast on 4 April 1363.\nJohn's third wife Agnes was the daughter of Ulrich II of Lindow-Ruppin and widow of Lord Nicholas IV of Werle.  They probably married in 1358 and had five children together:\n\nJohn II (died between 6 July and 9 October 1416), co-regent, then Duke of Mecklenburg-Stargard, from 1408 Lord of Sternberg, Friedland, F\u00fcrstenberg and Lychen\nUlrich I (died 8 April 1417), co-regent, then Duke of Mecklenburg-Stargard (1392\u20131417), from 1408 Lord of Neubrandenburg, Stargard, Strelitz and Wesenberg (with Lize)\nRudolf (died after 28 July 1415), was initially Bishop of Skara and from 1390 as Rudolf III Bishop of Schwerin\nAlbert I (died 1397), co-regent of Mecklenburg, from 1396 Coadjutor of Dorpat\nContance (born c. 1373, died 1408)\n\nExternal links\nGenealogical table of the House of Mecklenburg\nPassage 4:\nEilika of Saxony\nEilika of Saxony (c.\u20091080 \u2013 16 January 1142) was a daughter of Magnus, Duke of Saxony and a member of the Billung dynasty. Through marriage to Otto of Ballenstedt, she was countess of Ballenstedt.\n\nLife\nEilika was the younger daughter of Magnus, Duke of Saxony and Sophia, daughter of King B\u00e9la I of Hungary. Since Eilika had no brothers, after her father's death in 1106, Eilika and her sister, Wulfhilde of Saxony, inherited his property. Eilika received property in Bernburg, Wei\u00dfenfels, Werben and perhaps also in Burgwerden and Kreichau, as well as the Palatinate of Saxony.In 1130 Eilika was in conflict with the citizens of the city of Halle, probably because of her support for Archbishop Norbert of Magdeburg. Fighting broke out, during which Conrad of Eichstadt was killed, and from which Eilika only escaped with difficulty.  \nAround 1131 Eilika wrested the advocacy of the monastery of Goseck (monastery) from Louis of Thuringia, and took it for herself. In 1133 Eilika expelled Abbot Bertold from Goseck for incompetency. In 1134 she introduced his successor, Abbot Penther, to the abbey with a solemn address to the monks. \nIn 1138 Eilika was accused of tyranny (tyrannis), and attacked at her castle of Bernburg.\n\nMarriage and children\nEilika married Count Otto of Ballenstedt before 1095. With Otto, Eilika had two children: Albert the Bear and Adelaide of Ballenstedt, who married Henry II, Margrave of the Nordmark.\nPassage 5:\nHenry IV, Duke of Mecklenburg\nHenry IV, Duke of Mecklenburg (1417 \u2013 9 March 1477) was from 1422 to 1477 Duke of Mecklenburg.\n\nLife\nHenry IV of Mecklenburg, because of his obesity and lavish lifestyle also called the \"Henry the Fat\", was the son of the Duke John IV of Mecklenburg and Catherine of Saxe-Lauenburg.\nHe inherited Mecklenburg when his father died in 1422.  His mother, Catherine, and his uncle, Albert V, acted as Regents until 1436.  He then ruled jointly with his brother John V, until his brothers death in 1442.  In May 1432, he married Dorothea of Brandenburg, the daughter of Elector Frederick I of Brandenburg.\nWith the death of Prince William of Werle in 1436, the male line of the Werle branch of the House of Mecklenburg died out, and Werle fell to the Duchy of Mecklenburg.  After Duke Ulrich II of Mecklenburg-Stargard died in 1471, Mecklenburg was again united under one ruler.\nThe Stettin War of Succession between the Pomeranian Dukes and the Brandenburg Electors ended in late May 1472 through Henry's mediation.\nAt the end of his life, he gradually transferred his power to his sons Albert, John and Magnus.  After Henry's death they ruled jointly, until John died in 1474 and Albert in 1483.  After Albert's death, Magnus ruled alone.  His younger brother Balthasar cared little about the business of government.\nHenry died in 1477 and was buried in the Doberan Abbey.\n\nIssue\nAlbert VI (\u2020 1483), Duke of Mecklenburg\nJohn VI (\u2020 1474), Duke of Mecklenburg\nMagnus II, Duke of Mecklenburg\nBalthasar Duke of Mecklenburg, coadjutor of the diocese of Schwerin until 1479.\n\nExternal links\nGenealogical table of the House of Mecklenburg\nPassage 6:\nJohn III, Duke of Mecklenburg-Stargard\nJohn III, Duke of Mecklenburg-Stargard (1389 \u2013 after 11 November 1438) was from 1416 to 1438 Duke of Mecklenburg, Lord of Stargard, Sternberg, Friedland, F\u00fcrstenberg, and Lychen.  To distinguish him from John V, Duke of Mecklenburg, he is sometimes called John the Elder.\n\nFamily\nHe was the oldest child of Duke John II and his wife Catherine (Wilheida) of Lithuania.\n\nLife\nJohn III was probably born in 1389.  In 1416, he took over the reign of Sternberg from his father.  He was taken prisoner by Brandenburg, for unknown reasons.  He was released on 28 June 1427, under the condition that he had to swear an oath of allegiance to the Margrave of Brandenburg.\nIn 1436, he and his cousin Henry and his remote cousin Henry IV of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, jointly inherited the Lordship of Werle.\nHe married Luttrud, the daughter of Albert IV of Anhalt-K\u00f6then.  She was probably a sister of Anna, the first wife of William of Werle, the last Lord of Werle.  The marriage remained childless.\nJohn III died in 1438 and was probably buried in Sternberg.  His cousin Henry of Mecklenburg-Stargard inherited his possessions.\nPassage 7:\nMagnus I, Duke of Mecklenburg\nMagnus I, Duke of Mecklenburg (1345 \u2013 1 September 1384) was Duke of Mecklenburg from 1383 until his death.  Magnus was the third son of Duke Albert II of Mecklenburg and his wife Euphemia of Sweden, the sister of the King Magnus IV of Sweden.  Sometime after 1362, he married Elizabeth of Pomerania-Wolgast, daughter of Barnim IV, Duke of Pomerania.\nMagnus had two children:\n\nJohn IV, Regent of Mecklenburg from 1384 to 1395 and co-regent from 1395 to 1422\nEuphemia (d. 16 October 1417);married on 18 October 1397 with Lord Balthasar of WerleAfter the death of his brother Henry III in 1383, he ruled Mecklenburg jointly with Henry's son Albert IV until his own death in 1384.\n\nExternal links\nGenealogical table of the House of Mecklenburg\nPassage 8:\nEuphemia of Sweden\nEuphemia of Sweden (Swedish: Eufemia Eriksdotter; 1317 \u2013 16 June 1370) was a Swedish princess. She was Duchess consort of Mecklenburg, heiress of Sweden and of Norway, and mother of King Albert of Sweden. \n(c. 1338-1412) .\n\nBiography\nEarly life\nEuphemia was born in 1317 to Eric Magnusson (b. c. 1282-1318), Duke of S\u00f6dermanland, second son of King Magnus I of Sweden, and Princess Ingeborg of Norway (1300\u20131360), the heiress and the only legitimate daughter of King Haakon V of Norway (1270\u2013 1319).In 1319, her infant elder brother Magnus VII of Norway (1316\u20131374) succeeded their maternal grandfather to the throne of Norway. That same year, Swedish nobles exiled their uncle, King Birger of Sweden, after which the infant Magnus was elected King of Sweden. Their mother Ingeborg had a seat in the guardian government as well as the position of an independent ruler of her own fiefs, and played an important part during their childhood and adolescence.The 24 July 1321 marriage contract for Euphemia was signed at Bohus in her mother's fief in Bohusl\u00e4n. Her mother had plans to take control over Danish Scania, next to her duchy. The marriage was arranged with the terms that Mecklenburg, Saxony, Holstein, Rendsburg and Schleswig would assist Ingeborg in the conquest of Scania. This was approved by the council of Norway but not Sweden. When Ingeborg's forces under command of \nKnut Porse of Varberg, invaded Scania in 1322\u201323, Mecklenburg betrayed her and the alliance was broken. Eventually, the affair of Euphemia's marriage led to a conflict between Ingeborg and the governments of Sweden and Norway, which led to the demise of Ingeborg's political position in the guardian governments. The marriage took place anyway, after a fifteen-year engagement. Euphemia did not lack influence in Sweden. She is known to have acted as the witness of seals in several documents. In 1335, when King Magnus appointed Nils Abj\u00f6rnsson (Sparre av Tofta) to drots, the condition that Euphemia would act as his adviser was included in his appointment.\n\nDuchess of Mecklenburg\nEuphemia was married in Rostock on April 10, 1336, to her distant kinsman, Albert II, Duke of Mecklenburg (1318 \u2013 2 February 1379), a North-German lord deeply interested in obtaining some power in Scandinavia. Later the same year, the couple returned to Sweden with Rudolf of Saxony and Henry of Holstein to be present at the coronation of her brother and sister-in-law Blanche of Namur. In Germany, Euphemia's life as a Duchess consort of Mecklenburg does not appear to have affected her status in Sweden, as she was still a political factor there and her name was still placed on various documents. She was the mistress of a very expensive ducal court. In 1340\u201341, she convinced Magnus to grant renewed trading privileges in Norway to the Hanseatic cities of Mecklenburg, Rostock and Wismar. On 15 April 1357, she granted her the estates Hammar and Farthses  to Sk\u00e4nninge Abbey following the deaths of her half-brothers Haakon and Canute in 1350. She was last confirmed alive 27 October 1363, when she gave up the ownership of her dower estate in Mecklenburg. Her death year is not known, but she is confirmed dead 16 June 1370, when her widower made a vicaria to her memory. Euphemia lived  to see her own second son depose her brother from the Swedish throne, and ascend as King Albert of Sweden in 1364.\n\nIssue\nAt the time of her death, she had five surviving children:\n\nHenry III, Duke of Mecklenburg (c. 1337\u20131383); Married, firstly, Ingeborg of Denmark (1347\u2013c. 1370), eldest daughter of sonless King Waldemar IV of Denmark.

This marriage remained childless.\nAfter an accident at a tournament in Wismar, Henry III died on 24 April 1383 at his castle in Schwerin and was buried in the Doberan Minster.  His brother Magnus I and his son Albert IV took up a brief joint rule of Mecklenburg, which lasted until 1384.\n\nExternal links\nGenealogical table of the House of Mecklenburg\n\n\n== Footnotes ==\nPassage 10:\nChristopher, Duke of Mecklenburg\nChristopher, Duke of Mecklenburg-Gadebusch (30 July 1537 \u2013 4 March 1592) was a son of Albrecht VII, Duke of Mecklenburg.  He was Duke of Mecklenburg-Gadebusch, as well as administrator of Ratzeburg and of the Commandery of Mirow.\n\nLife\nChristopher was born in Augsburg. At the urging of his elder brother John Albert I, the cathedral chapter appointed Christopher as the successor of Bishop Christopher I of Ratzeburg in 1554.  Christopher thus became the first Lutheran administrator of the Bishopric.\nIn 1555, he was also elected coadjutor of Bishop William of Riga, with the right of succession.  His election was controversial and led to armed clashes.  During a clash on 1 July 1556 in Koknese, Christoper and William were both taken prisoner.  They were released in 1557, and Christopher was recognized as coadjutor.  However, when William died in 1563, Christopher found himself unable to exercise his right of succession.  Instead, he was taken prisoner again during renewed fighting against Poland.  He was released in 1569, after he had renounced all claims on Riga.  After his release, he returned to Mecklenburg.\nHe died on 4 March 1592 at Tempzin Abbey and was buried in the northern chapel of the high choir of Schwerin Cathedral.  His widow commissioned a grave monument, which shows a couple kneeling before a prie-dieu.  It was crafted in the workshop of the Flemish sculptor Robert Coppens, with assistance from the Pomeranian painter Georg Strachen.\n\nMarriages and issue\nChristopher married his first wife on 27 October 1573 in Kolding.  She was Princess Dorothea of Denmark (1528 \u2013 11 November 1575), a daughter of King Frederick I of Denmark.  She died only two years later, in Sch\u00f6nberg, which was the capital of the Prince-Bishopric of Ratzeburg.\nHe married his second wife on 7 May 1581 in Stockholm.

Eric himself probably died on 21 December or 22 December 1508. He was buried in the Doberan Minster in Bad Doberan. He never married and died childless.\nPassage 3:\nJohn I, Duke of Mecklenburg-Stargard\nJohn I, Duke of Mecklenburg-Stargard (1326 \u2013 9 August 1392 or 9 February 1393), Duke of Mecklenburg from 1344 to 1352 and Duke of Mecklenburg-Stargard from 1352 to 1392.\n\nFamily\nHe was probably the youngest child from the second marriage of Lord Henry II \"the Lion\" of Mecklenburg and Anna of Saxe-Wittenberg, a daughter of Duke Albert II of Saxe-Wittenberg.\n\nLife\nJohn I was probably born in 1326.  His father died in 1329, and he remained under guardianship until 1344, when he came of age and began to carry a seal as a participant in the governance of Mecklenburg.  On 8 July 1348, Holy Roman Emperor Charles IV raised John and his brother Albert II to the rank of Duke in Prague.  John, Albert and Charles initially supported the False Waldemar, but in 1350 they reconciled with his supporter Duke Louis V of Bavaria.\nUpon the division of Mecklenburg on 25 November 1352, John was awarded the Lordships of Stargard, Sternbuerg and Ture.  He supported his nephew Albert III of Mecklenburg in his attempts to be recognized as King of Sweden.\n\nMarriages and issue\nJohn married three times. His first wife Rixa (background unknown) probably died soon after the wedding and the marriage remained childless.\nHis second wife Anna was a daughter of the count Adolf VII of Pinneberg and Schauenburg.  She probably died in 1358.  John and Anna had a daughter Anna, who married Wartislaw VI of Pomerania-Wolgast on 4 April 1363.\nJohn's third wife Agnes was the daughter of Ulrich II of Lindow-Ruppin and widow of Lord Nicholas IV of Werle.  They probably married in 1358 and had five children together:\n\nJohn II (died between 6 July and 9 October 1416), co-regent, then Duke of Mecklenburg-Stargard, from 1408 Lord of Sternberg, Friedland, F\u00fcrstenberg and Lychen\nUlrich I (died 8 April 1417), co-regent, then Duke of Mecklenburg-Stargard (1392\u20131417), from 1408 Lord of Neubrandenburg, Stargard, Strelitz and Wesenberg (with Lize)\nRudolf (died after 28 July 1415), was initially Bishop of Skara and from 1390 as Rudolf III Bishop of Schwerin\nAlbert I (died 1397), co-regent of Mecklenburg, from 1396 Coadjutor of Dorpat\nContance (born c. 1373, died 1408)\n\nExternal links\nGenealogical table of the House of Mecklenburg\nPassage 4:\nEilika of Saxony\nEilika of Saxony (c.\u20091080 \u2013 16 January 1142) was a daughter of Magnus, Duke of Saxony and a member of the Billung dynasty. Through marriage to Otto of Ballenstedt, she was countess of Ballenstedt.\n\nLife\nEilika was the younger daughter of Magnus, Duke of Saxony and Sophia, daughter of King B\u00e9la I of Hungary. Since Eilika had no brothers, after her father's death in 1106, Eilika and her sister, Wulfhilde of Saxony, inherited his property. Eilika received property in Bernburg, Wei\u00dfenfels, Werben and perhaps also in Burgwerden and Kreichau, as well as the Palatinate of Saxony.In 1130 Eilika was in conflict with the citizens of the city of Halle, probably because of her support for Archbishop Norbert of Magdeburg. Fighting broke out, during which Conrad of Eichstadt was killed, and from which Eilika only escaped with difficulty.  \nAround 1131 Eilika wrested the advocacy of the monastery of Goseck (monastery) from Louis of Thuringia, and took it for herself. In 1133 Eilika expelled Abbot Bertold from Goseck for incompetency. In 1134 she introduced his successor, Abbot Penther, to the abbey with a solemn address to the monks. \nIn 1138 Eilika was accused of tyranny (tyrannis), and attacked at her castle of Bernburg.\n\nMarriage and children\nEilika married Count Otto of Ballenstedt before 1095. With Otto, Eilika had two children: Albert the Bear and Adelaide of Ballenstedt, who married Henry II, Margrave of the Nordmark.\nPassage 5:\nHenry IV, Duke of Mecklenburg\nHenry IV, Duke of Mecklenburg (1417 \u2013 9 March 1477) was from 1422 to 1477 Duke of Mecklenburg.\n\nLife\nHenry IV of Mecklenburg, because of his obesity and lavish lifestyle also called the \"Henry the Fat\", was the son of the Duke John IV of Mecklenburg and Catherine of Saxe-Lauenburg.\nHe inherited Mecklenburg when his father died in 1422.  His mother, Catherine, and his uncle, Albert V, acted as Regents until 1436.  He then ruled jointly with his brother John V, until his brothers death in 1442.  In May 1432, he married Dorothea of Brandenburg, the daughter of Elector Frederick I of Brandenburg.\nWith the death of Prince William of Werle in 1436, the male line of the Werle branch of the House of Mecklenburg died out, and Werle fell to the Duchy of Mecklenburg.  After Duke Ulrich II of Mecklenburg-Stargard died in 1471, Mecklenburg was again united under one ruler.\nThe Stettin War of Succession between the Pomeranian Dukes and the Brandenburg Electors ended in late May 1472 through Henry's mediation.\nAt the end of his life, he gradually transferred his power to his sons Albert, John and Magnus.  After Henry's death they ruled jointly, until John died in 1474 and Albert in 1483.  After Albert's death, Magnus ruled alone.  His younger brother Balthasar cared little about the business of government.\nHenry died in 1477 and was buried in the Doberan Abbey.\n\nIssue\nAlbert VI (\u2020 1483), Duke of Mecklenburg\nJohn VI (\u2020 1474), Duke of Mecklenburg\nMagnus II, Duke of Mecklenburg\nBalthasar Duke of Mecklenburg, coadjutor of the diocese of Schwerin until 1479.\n\nExternal links\nGenealogical table of the House of Mecklenburg\nPassage 6:\nJohn III, Duke of Mecklenburg-Stargard\nJohn III, Duke of Mecklenburg-Stargard (1389 \u2013 after 11 November 1438) was from 1416 to 1438 Duke of Mecklenburg, Lord of Stargard, Sternberg, Friedland, F\u00fcrstenberg, and Lychen.  To distinguish him from John V, Duke of Mecklenburg, he is sometimes called John the Elder.\n\nFamily\nHe was the oldest child of Duke John II and his wife Catherine (Wilheida) of Lithuania.\n\nLife\nJohn III was probably born in 1389.  In 1416, he took over the reign of Sternberg from his father.  He was taken prisoner by Brandenburg, for unknown reasons.  He was released on 28 June 1427, under the condition that he had to swear an oath of allegiance to the Margrave of Brandenburg.\nIn 1436, he and his cousin Henry and his remote cousin Henry IV of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, jointly inherited the Lordship of Werle.\nHe married Luttrud, the daughter of Albert IV of Anhalt-K\u00f6then.  She was probably a sister of Anna, the first wife of William of Werle, the last Lord of Werle.  The marriage remained childless.\nJohn III died in 1438 and was probably buried in Sternberg.  His cousin Henry of Mecklenburg-Stargard inherited his possessions.\nPassage 7:\nMagnus I, Duke of Mecklenburg\nMagnus I, Duke of Mecklenburg (1345 \u2013 1 September 1384) was Duke of Mecklenburg from 1383 until his death.  Magnus was the third son of Duke Albert II of Mecklenburg and his wife Euphemia of Sweden, the sister of the King Magnus IV of Sweden.  Sometime after 1362, he married Elizabeth of Pomerania-Wolgast, daughter of Barnim IV, Duke of Pomerania.\nMagnus had two children:\n\nJohn IV, Regent of Mecklenburg from 1384 to 1395 and co-regent from 1395 to 1422\nEuphemia (d. 16 October 1417);married on 18 October 1397 with Lord Balthasar of WerleAfter the death of his brother Henry III in 1383, he ruled Mecklenburg jointly with Henry's son Albert IV until his own death in 1384.\n\nExternal links\nGenealogical table of the House of Mecklenburg\nPassage 8:\nEuphemia of Sweden\nEuphemia of Sweden (Swedish: Eufemia Eriksdotter; 1317 \u2013 16 June 1370) was a Swedish princess. She was Duchess consort of Mecklenburg, heiress of Sweden and of Norway, and mother of King Albert of Sweden. \n(c. 1338-1412) .\n\nBiography\nEarly life\nEuphemia was born in 1317 to Eric Magnusson (b. c. 1282-1318), Duke of S\u00f6dermanland, second son of King Magnus I of Sweden, and Princess Ingeborg of Norway (1300\u20131360), the heiress and the only legitimate daughter of King Haakon V of Norway (1270\u2013 1319).In 1319, her infant elder brother Magnus VII of Norway (1316\u20131374) succeeded their maternal grandfather to the throne of Norway. That same year, Swedish nobles exiled their uncle, King Birger of Sweden, after which the infant Magnus was elected King of Sweden. Their mother Ingeborg had a seat in the guardian government as well as the position of an independent ruler of her own fiefs, and played an important part during their childhood and adolescence.The 24 July 1321 marriage contract for Euphemia was signed at Bohus in her mother's fief in Bohusl\u00e4n. Her mother had plans to take control over Danish Scania, next to her duchy. The marriage was arranged with the terms that Mecklenburg, Saxony, Holstein, Rendsburg and Schleswig would assist Ingeborg in the conquest of Scania. This was approved by the council of Norway but not Sweden. When Ingeborg's forces under command of \nKnut Porse of Varberg, invaded Scania in 1322\u201323, Mecklenburg betrayed her and the alliance was broken. Eventually, the affair of Euphemia's marriage led to a conflict between Ingeborg and the governments of Sweden and Norway, which led to the demise of Ingeborg's political position in the guardian governments. The marriage took place anyway, after a fifteen-year engagement. Euphemia did not lack influence in Sweden. She is known to have acted as the witness of seals in several documents. In 1335, when King Magnus appointed Nils Abj\u00f6rnsson (Sparre av Tofta) to drots, the condition that Euphemia would act as his adviser was included in his appointment.\n\nDuchess of Mecklenburg\nEuphemia was married in Rostock on April 10, 1336, to her distant kinsman, Albert II, Duke of Mecklenburg (1318 \u2013 2 February 1379), a North-German lord deeply interested in obtaining some power in Scandinavia. Later the same year, the couple returned to Sweden with Rudolf of Saxony and Henry of Holstein to be present at the coronation of her brother and sister-in-law Blanche of Namur. In Germany, Euphemia's life as a Duchess consort of Mecklenburg does not appear to have affected her status in Sweden, as she was still a political factor there and her name was still placed on various documents. She was the mistress of a very expensive ducal court. In 1340\u201341, she convinced Magnus to grant renewed trading privileges in Norway to the Hanseatic cities of Mecklenburg, Rostock and Wismar. On 15 April 1357, she granted her the estates Hammar and Farthses  to Sk\u00e4nninge Abbey following the deaths of her half-brothers Haakon and Canute in 1350. She was last confirmed alive 27 October 1363, when she gave up the ownership of her dower estate in Mecklenburg. Her death year is not known, but she is confirmed dead 16 June 1370, when her widower made a vicaria to her memory. Euphemia lived  to see her own second son depose her brother from the Swedish throne, and ascend as King Albert of Sweden in 1364.\n\nIssue\nAt the time of her death, she had five surviving children:\n\nHenry III, Duke of Mecklenburg (c. 1337\u20131383); Married, firstly, Ingeborg of Denmark (1347\u2013c. 1370), eldest daughter of sonless King Waldemar IV of Denmark.

This marriage remained childless.\nAfter an accident at a tournament in Wismar, Henry III died on 24 April 1383 at his castle in Schwerin and was buried in the Doberan Minster.  His brother Magnus I and his son Albert IV took up a brief joint rule of Mecklenburg, which lasted until 1384.\n\nExternal links\nGenealogical table of the House of Mecklenburg\n\n\n== Footnotes ==\nPassage 10:\nChristopher, Duke of Mecklenburg\nChristopher, Duke of Mecklenburg-Gadebusch (30 July 1537 \u2013 4 March 1592) was a son of Albrecht VII, Duke of Mecklenburg.  He was Duke of Mecklenburg-Gadebusch, as well as administrator of Ratzeburg and of the Commandery of Mirow.\n\nLife\nChristopher was born in Augsburg. At the urging of his elder brother John Albert I, the cathedral chapter appointed Christopher as the successor of Bishop Christopher I of Ratzeburg in 1554.  Christopher thus became the first Lutheran administrator of the Bishopric.\nIn 1555, he was also elected coadjutor of Bishop William of Riga, with the right of succession.  His election was controversial and led to armed clashes.  During a clash on 1 July 1556 in Koknese, Christoper and William were both taken prisoner.  They were released in 1557, and Christopher was recognized as coadjutor.  However, when William died in 1563, Christopher found himself unable to exercise his right of succession.  Instead, he was taken prisoner again during renewed fighting against Poland.  He was released in 1569, after he had renounced all claims on Riga.  After his release, he returned to Mecklenburg.\nHe died on 4 March 1592 at Tempzin Abbey and was buried in the northern chapel of the high choir of Schwerin Cathedral.  His widow commissioned a grave monument, which shows a couple kneeling before a prie-dieu.  It was crafted in the workshop of the Flemish sculptor Robert Coppens, with assistance from the Pomeranian painter Georg Strachen.\n\nMarriages and issue\nChristopher married his first wife on 27 October 1573 in Kolding.  She was Princess Dorothea of Denmark (1528 \u2013 11 November 1575), a daughter of King Frederick I of Denmark.

Smith and starring Ryan Gosling and David Morse.  The film, set in contemporary Montana, explores the relationship between a small-town high school football player (Gosling), and his troubled coach (Morse). The film was nominated for the Grand Jury Prize at the 2002 Sundance Film Festival.\n\nPlot\nRoy Chutney is a high school senior in the fictional Montana town of Blue Springs. Roy does not have an especially close relationship with his mother Evangeline and has not seen his father in years. That does not prevent Roy from feeling emotionally devastated when he learns that his father has killed himself, and Roy's self-esteem takes a beating when he is cut from the high school football team shortly afterward. Roy whiles away his time by swilling beer with his best friend, Tracy Two Dogs, and falling into a romance with Skyla, a barmaid at a local tavern, but Roy's short time on the high school gridiron seems to have impressed Gideon Ferguson, a local character who coaches an unsanctioned high school six-man football team when he is not delivering newspapers or trying to score a gig singing country songs at nearby honky-tonks.\nGideon thinks that Roy has potential and asks him to join his team; encouraged by Gideon's belief in him, Roy agrees, and he persuades Tracy and his friend Russ to tag along. While playing hardscrabble six-man football helps restore Roy's self-confidence, he finds it does not answer his questions about his future or his relationship with Skyla. When Gideon's overwhelming interest in Roy begins to lend credence to town rumors that Gideon is gay, Roy starts to wonder just why he was asked to join the team.\n\nCast\nRyan Gosling as Roy Chutney\nDavid Morse as Gideon Ferguson\nClea DuVall as Skyla Sisco\nKelly Lynch as Evangeline Chutney\nDavid Cale as Studebaker\nEddie Spears as Tracy Two Dogs\nAmy Adams as Doreen\nKen White as Russ Colfax\n\nProduction\nJay Farrar, founder of the alternative country bands Uncle Tupelo and Son Volt, composed the film's musical score. New songs were written and performed by Vic Chesnutt and Freakwater, and existing songs by Ryan Adams, Uncle Tupelo, and the Pernice Brothers were also included.Filming for the movie largely took place in Great Falls, Montana, and a series of small towns in the Great Falls vicinity.The title of the film comes from the term \"slaughter rule.\" The unofficial rule provides for an athletic competition's premature conclusion if one team is ahead of the other by a certain number of points prior to game's end. The rule helps to avoid humiliating the losing team further.\n\nRelease\nThe film premiered in January 2002 during the Sundance Film Festival. Later that year, the film entered the South by Southwest Film Festival and the AFI Film Festival. It went into limited release nationwide beginning January 2003.\n\nCritical reception\nOn review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 74% based on 31 reviews, and an average rating of 5.9/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"A bleak but original indie, The Slaughter Rule benefits from outstanding performances by Ryan Gosling and David Morse.\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 65 out of 100, based on 13 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".While the performances by Morse and Gosling were generally received positively, some reviews of the film criticized the script. Reviewing the film for The New York Times, Stephen Holden praised the performances of Gosling and Morse, but opined that the film is \"confused\" and \"doesn't have much dramatic momentum\". In her review for the Los Angeles Times, Manohla Dargis praised the film's cinematography but wrote that although the film has the virtue of sincerity, the story is \"over-explained\".Joe Leydon of Variety claimed the script \"plays like a first draft\". However, Marjorie Baumgarten of The Austin Chronicle thought that the \"writing and directing team of twin brothers Alex and Andrew Smith have made an astonishingly good first feature\". J. R. Jones, writing in Chicago Reader, described the film as \"powerful\" and especially praised David Morse's performance.\n\nAccolades\nThe film received the FIPRESCI Prize at the 2002 Stockholm Film Festival and the Milagro Award at the 2002 Santa Fe Film Festival.

He was a member of a famous Scottish golfing family. His brother Willie won the U.S. Open in 1899, and Alex won it in both 1906 and 1910. Like many British professionals of his era he spent much of his adult life working as a club professional in the United States.\n\nEarly life\nSmith was born in Carnoustie, Scotland, on 28 January 1874, the son of John D. Smith and Joann Smith n\u00e9e Robinson. On 18 January 1895 he was married to Jessie Maiden\u2014sister of James Maiden\u2014and they had two daughters, Fannie and Margaret, born in 1896 and 1899, respectively. Smith was sometimes referred to as \"Alec\" Smith, especially early in his career.\n\nGolf career\nHe was the head professional at Nassau Country Club in Glen Cove, New York, from 1901 through 1909. James Maiden, who would forge a successful golf career of his own, served as assistant professional under Smith at Nassau.In 1901, Smith lost to Willie Anderson in a playoff for the U.S. Open title. Smith's 1906 U.S. Open victory came at the Onwentsia Club in Lake Forest, Illinois. His 72-hole score of 295 was the lowest at either the U.S. Open or the British Open up to that time, and he won $300. The 1910 U.S. Open was played over the St. Martin's course at the Philadelphia Cricket Club. Smith won a three-man playoff against American John McDermott and another of his own brothers, Macdonald Smith. Alex Smith played in eighteen U.S. Opens in total and accumulated eleven top ten placings.\nSmith, who partnered with C. A. Dunning in the 1905 Metropolitan Open four-ball tournament held on 16 September 1905 at Fox Hills Golf Club on Staten Island, tied for first place with George Low and Fred Herreshoff with a score of 71.

Smith and starring Ryan Gosling and David Morse.  The film, set in contemporary Montana, explores the relationship between a small-town high school football player (Gosling), and his troubled coach (Morse). The film was nominated for the Grand Jury Prize at the 2002 Sundance Film Festival.\n\nPlot\nRoy Chutney is a high school senior in the fictional Montana town of Blue Springs. Roy does not have an especially close relationship with his mother Evangeline and has not seen his father in years. That does not prevent Roy from feeling emotionally devastated when he learns that his father has killed himself, and Roy's self-esteem takes a beating when he is cut from the high school football team shortly afterward. Roy whiles away his time by swilling beer with his best friend, Tracy Two Dogs, and falling into a romance with Skyla, a barmaid at a local tavern, but Roy's short time on the high school gridiron seems to have impressed Gideon Ferguson, a local character who coaches an unsanctioned high school six-man football team when he is not delivering newspapers or trying to score a gig singing country songs at nearby honky-tonks.\nGideon thinks that Roy has potential and asks him to join his team; encouraged by Gideon's belief in him, Roy agrees, and he persuades Tracy and his friend Russ to tag along. While playing hardscrabble six-man football helps restore Roy's self-confidence, he finds it does not answer his questions about his future or his relationship with Skyla. When Gideon's overwhelming interest in Roy begins to lend credence to town rumors that Gideon is gay, Roy starts to wonder just why he was asked to join the team.\n\nCast\nRyan Gosling as Roy Chutney\nDavid Morse as Gideon Ferguson\nClea DuVall as Skyla Sisco\nKelly Lynch as Evangeline Chutney\nDavid Cale as Studebaker\nEddie Spears as Tracy Two Dogs\nAmy Adams as Doreen\nKen White as Russ Colfax\n\nProduction\nJay Farrar, founder of the alternative country bands Uncle Tupelo and Son Volt, composed the film's musical score. New songs were written and performed by Vic Chesnutt and Freakwater, and existing songs by Ryan Adams, Uncle Tupelo, and the Pernice Brothers were also included.Filming for the movie largely took place in Great Falls, Montana, and a series of small towns in the Great Falls vicinity.The title of the film comes from the term \"slaughter rule.\" The unofficial rule provides for an athletic competition's premature conclusion if one team is ahead of the other by a certain number of points prior to game's end. The rule helps to avoid humiliating the losing team further.\n\nRelease\nThe film premiered in January 2002 during the Sundance Film Festival.

It went into limited release nationwide beginning January 2003.\n\nCritical reception\nOn review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 74% based on 31 reviews, and an average rating of 5.9/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"A bleak but original indie, The Slaughter Rule benefits from outstanding performances by Ryan Gosling and David Morse.\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 65 out of 100, based on 13 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".While the performances by Morse and Gosling were generally received positively, some reviews of the film criticized the script. Reviewing the film for The New York Times, Stephen Holden praised the performances of Gosling and Morse, but opined that the film is \"confused\" and \"doesn't have much dramatic momentum\". In her review for the Los Angeles Times, Manohla Dargis praised the film's cinematography but wrote that although the film has the virtue of sincerity, the story is \"over-explained\".Joe Leydon of Variety claimed the script \"plays like a first draft\". However, Marjorie Baumgarten of The Austin Chronicle thought that the \"writing and directing team of twin brothers Alex and Andrew Smith have made an astonishingly good first feature\". J. R. Jones, writing in Chicago Reader, described the film as \"powerful\" and especially praised David Morse's performance.\n\nAccolades\nThe film received the FIPRESCI Prize at the 2002 Stockholm Film Festival and the Milagro Award at the 2002 Santa Fe Film Festival.

Dunning in the 1905 Metropolitan Open four-ball tournament held on 16 September 1905 at Fox Hills Golf Club on Staten Island, tied for first place with George Low and Fred Herreshoff with a score of 71.

The film is a modern-day telling of the Greek mythological tale of the Gorgon and was inspired by the 1964 classic Hammer Horror film of the same name and the 1981 cult classic Clash of the Titans.

However, in 2009, Rollin began preparation foe Le masque de la M\u00e9duse. Rollin originally directed the film as a one-hour short, which was screened at the Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que de Toulouse, but after the release, Rollin decided to add 20 minutes of additional scenes and then cut the film into two distinct parts, as he did with his first feature, Le Viol du Vampire.  The film was shot on location at the Golden Gate Aquarium and P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery, as well as on stage at the Theatre du Grande Guignol, which is where the longest part of the film takes place.

The film stars Kermit Maynard, Robert Warwick, and Jim Thorpe.\n\nCast\nPlot\nRaoul Marlin kills a fur trapper, and is captured and imprisoned by members of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.  Snaky, a member of his gang, kills the two Mounties guarding him, and helps him escape, but another Mountie, Jim Wilson, tracks him down and recaptures him. However, as they are making their way back to jail, more members of the gang Marlin belongs to, including the gang's leader, Jean, waylay them and free Marlin once again. Wilson and his partner, Rogers, begin tracking the gang down. The trail leads them to a general store which is owned by Duval, who is Jean's second-in-command, as well as being in love with her. Wilson hatches a plan to go undercover and impersonate a notorious thief and murderer, Benet.  When he gets to the store, he witnesses Duval kill an Indian, when the Indian refuses to sell his furs for fifty cents each. Jean tells him to get out of there, but Wilson gives her his story of being Benet, and wanting to partner with her and split the black market in the region with her. Wilson's cover is further bolstered when Rogers begins spreading a \"rumor\" around town that Wilson is Benet.  After spreading the rumor, Rogers leaves to go get more Mounties to help break up the gang. \nDuval, jealous of the attention Jean is bestowing on Wilson/Benet, as well as being upset over being shut out of their deal, begins to dig into Benet's history.  At the newspaper office, he finds out that the real Benet had been hung a short time earlier.  He takes the newspaper article to Jean, who is furious, and gathers her gang to go after Wilson. Just as they are about to hunt Wilson down, Rogers and the others Mounties arrive. Most of the gang is arrested, but Jean and Marlin escape.  Wilson takes out after the two.  As he catches up with them, Marlin gets a bead on him, but is shot and killed by Jean, who has developed feelings for Wilson. In exchange, Wilson lets Jean escape.\n\nProduction\nThis was the fifth production of a work by James Oliver Curwood starring Kermit Maynard.  It went into production on May 9, 1935, directed by Sam Neufeld.  It was scheduled for a June 8 release, and opened on time.\n\nReception\nThe Film Daily gave it a positive review, calling it an \"outdoor action story with better than usual attention to general production details\".  They complimented the scenery, Maynard's roping and riding skills, and felt it had enough action throughout, but went \"slightly overboard on dialogue and gunplay\".  The felt the direction was good, and the cinematography excellent.  In a brief review, the Motion Picture Herald gave it a lukewarm review, saying that the film was \"fair\", but the cinematography was \"excellent\", and Maynard's performance was \"well-liked\".\nPassage 4:\nQuerelle\nQuerelle is a 1982 West German-French English-language arthouse film directed by Rainer Werner Fassbinder and starring Brad Davis, adapted from French author Jean Genet's 1947 novel Querelle of Brest. It was Fassbinder's last film, released shortly after his death at the age of 37.\n\nPlot\nThe plot centers on the handsome Belgian sailor Georges Querelle, who is also a thief and murderer. When his ship, Le Vengeur, arrives in Brest, he visits the Feria, a bar and brothel for sailors run by the Madame Lysiane, whose lover, Robert, is Querelle's brother. Querelle has a love/hate relationship with his brother: when they meet at La Feria, they embrace, but also punch one another slowly and repeatedly in the belly. Lysiane's husband Nono works behind the bar and also manages La Feria's underhanded affairs with the assistance of his friend, the corrupt police captain Mario.\nQuerelle makes a deal to sell opium to Nono. During the execution of the deal, he murders his accomplice Vic by slitting his throat.  After delivering the drugs, Querelle announces that he wants to sleep with Lysiane.  He knows that this means he will have to throw dice with Nono, who has the privilege of playing a game of chance with all of her prospective lovers. If Nono loses, the suitor is allowed to proceed with his affair. If the suitor loses, however, he must submit to anal sex with Nono first, according to Nono's maxim that \"That way, I can say my wife only sleeps with arseholes.\" Querelle deliberately loses the game, allowing himself to be sodomized by Nono. When Nono gloats about Querelle's \"loss\" to Robert, who won his dice game, the brothers end up in a violent fight.  Later, Querelle becomes Lysiane's lover, and also has sex with Mario.\nLuckily for Querelle, a builder, Gil, murders his work mate Theo, who had been harassing and sexually assaulting him.  Gil hides from the police in an abandoned prison, and Roger, who is in love with Gil, establishes contact between Querelle and Gil in the hopes that Querelle can help Gil flee. Querelle falls in love with Gil, who closely resembles his brother.  Gil returns his affections, but Querelle betrays Gil by tipping off the police. Querelle cleverly arranged it so that the murder of Vic is also blamed on Gil.\nQuerelle's superior, Lieutenant Seblon, is in love with Querelle, and constantly tries to prove his manliness to him. Seblon is aware that Querelle murdered Vic, but chooses to protect him.  Later, Seblon reveals his love and concern to a drunken Querelle, and they kiss and embrace before returning to Le Vengeur.\n\nCast\nBrad Davis as Querelle\nFranco Nero as Lieutenant Seblon\nJeanne Moreau as Lysiane\nLaurent Malet as Roger Bataille\nHanno P\u00f6schl as Robert / Gil\nG\u00fcnther Kaufmann as Nono\nBurkhard Driest as Mario\nRoger Fritz as Marcellin\nDieter Schidor as Vic Rivette\nNatja Brunckhorst as Paulette\nWerner Asam as Worker\nAxel Bauer as Worker\nNeil Bell as Theo\nRobert van Ackeren as Drunken legionnaire\nWolf Gremm as Drunken legionnaire\nFrank Ripploh as Drunken legionnaire\n\nProduction\nAccording to Genet's biographer Edmund White, Querelle was originally going to be made by Werner Schroeter, with a scenario by Burkhard Driest, and produced by Dieter Schidor. However, Schidor could not find the money to finance a film by Schroeter, and therefore turned to other directors, including John Schlesinger and Sam Peckinpah, before finally settling on Fassbinder. Driest wrote a radically different script for Fassbinder, who then \"took the linear narrative and jumbled it up\". White quotes Schidor as saying \"Fassbinder did something totally different, he took the words of Genet and tried to meditate on something other than the story. The story became totally unimportant for him. He also said publicly that the story was a sort of third-rate police story that wouldn't be worth making a movie about without putting a particular moral impact into it\".Schroeter had wanted to make a black and white film with amateur actors and location shots, but Fassbinder instead shot it with professional actors in a lurid, expressionist color, and on sets in the studio. Edmund White comments that the result is a film in which, \"Everything is bathed in an artificial light and the architectural elements are all symbolic.\"\n\nSoundtrack\nJeanne Moreau \u2013 \"Each Man Kills the Things He Loves\" (music by Peer Raben, lyrics from Oscar Wilde's poem \"The Ballad of Reading Gaol\")\n\"Young and Joyful Bandit\" (Music by Peer Raben, lyrics by Jeanne Moreau)Both songs were nominated to the 1984 Razzie Awards for \"Worst Original Song\".\n\nRelease\nQuerelle sold more than 100,000 tickets in the first three weeks after its release in Paris, the first time that a film with a gay theme had achieved such success. On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, which categorizes reviews as positive or negative only, the film has an approval rating of 57% calculated based on 14 critics comments. By comparison, with the same opinions being calculated using a weighted arithmetic mean, the rating is 6.10/10. Writing for The New York Times critic Vincent Canby noted that Querelle was \"a mess...a detour that leads to a dead end.\"\nPenny Ashbrook calls Querelle Fassbinder's \"perfect epitaph: an intensely personal statement that is the most uncompromising portrayal of gay male sensibility to come from a major filmmaker.\" Edmund White considers Querelle the only film based on Genet's book that works, calling it \"visually as artificial and menacing as Genet's prose.\" Genet, in discussion with Schidor, said that he had not seen the film, commenting \"You can't smoke at the movies.\"\nPassage 5:\nThulasi (1987 film)\nThulasi is a 1987 Indian Tamil-language romantic drama film directed by Ameerjan. The film stars Murali and Seetha. It was released on 27 November 1987.\n\nPlot\nThirunavukarasu is considered as a God by his villagers.

Sammadham's best friend Siva, a low caste boy, passes the Master of Arts degree successfully. Thirunavukarasu's daughter Thulasi then develops a soft corner for Siva.\nThirunavukarasu cannot accept for his son Sammadham's marriage with Ponni due to caste difference. Sammadham then challenges him to marry her. Thirunavukarasu appoints henchmen to kill her and Ponni is found dead the next day in the water. In the meantime, Siva also falls in love with Thulasi.

He is best known for his portrayal of Abraham Lincoln in D.W. Griffith's controversial 1915 silent historical epic The Birth of a Nation.\n\nEarly years\nHenabery was born in Omaha and raised in Los Angeles. He began acting as an amateur in California. Before he worked in films, Henabery worked for the San Pedro, Los Angeles, Salt Lake Railroad. When he was 25 years old, he became an extra for Universal Pictures.\n\nCareer\nHenabery's acting career began in The Joke on Yellentown (1914).  From 1914 to 1917 he appeared in seventeen films, including his portrayal of Lincoln in The Birth of a Nation.\nHenabery also worked as a second-unit director on Griffith's Intolerance (1916), and supervised the filming of at least one extended sequence that appeared in the film. Henabery also acted as Admiral de Coligny in the Renaissance French portion of the film depicting the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre. Throughout the rest of his career, he worked as a director. From the mid-1920s, and after professional disagreements with both Louis B. Mayer at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Adolph Zukor at Paramount Pictures, Henabery found employment as a director for smaller Hollywood studios. \nIn 1931 he joined the Vitaphone studio in New York City, where he directed dozens of short subjects for the next 10 years. Most of them were musicals and comedies, featuring a host of popular singers in 20-minute sketches. Henabery remained with Vitaphone until the New York studio closed in 1940.\nHenabery made documentaries and training films as a member of the Army Signal Corps.\n\nAs Abraham Lincoln\nAlthough Henabery's impersonation of Lincoln was a masterpiece of facial makeup, the 6'1\" (185 cm) Henabery was three inches shorter than the 6'4\" (193 cm) Lincoln. Kevin Brownlow's book The Parade's Gone By (1968) contains a photo of Henabery in costume and makeup as Lincoln, seated in a chair with planks placed on the floor under Henabery's feet so that his knees are raised several inches; this effect (with the planks kept off-camera in the movie) made Henabery's legs appear longer than they actually were.\n\nPersonal life and death\nHenabery and his wife, Lilian, had a daughter and a son. Henabery died on February 18, 1976, aged 88, at the Motion Picture Country House in Los Angeles, California.\n\nFilmography\nDirector\nActor\nThe Race War (1915) with Bessie Buskirk\nPassage 8:\nMcGuire of the Mounted\nMcGuire of the Mounted is a 1923 American crime film directed by Richard Stanton and written by George Hively.

The film was released on July 9, 1923, by Universal Pictures.\n\nPlot\nAs described in a film magazine, Old Andr\u00e9 Montreau (Lockney), who runs a little ferry across and down a large stream in the Canadian woods, is found seriously wounded by Bob McGuire (Desmond), a member of the Northwest Mounted Police, and an old-time friend of the guide and his daughter, Julie (Lorraine). Andre tells him that he does not know who his assailant was, but describes him as best he can. Later McGuire and Julie become engaged and the old man dies from the effects of the wounds. Bill Lusk (Louis), the proprietor of the village saloon and dance hall, is in league with Decker (Johnson), who is engaged in smuggling dope over the border. They find that McGuire is on to them and plot to make him one of them so that they can continue their traffic unhampered. Katie (James), who Decker has in his power because of certain knowledge he possesses, is forced to put some drug in McGuire's punch while he is at the ball held that night in honor of the new wife (Browne) of Major Cordwell's (Lowery), who has just arrived. When McGuire wakes the next morning, he is horror-struck to learn that he is married to Katie. Katie finally comes to love McGuire, though he can never find it in him to forget his Julie. She refuses to carry on any further with the plans of Lusk and Decker, so they plan a new way of getting McGuire. They tell Katie that he is in love with Major Cordwell's wife and are ready to prove it if she will invite her to her house. They also tell the major to be present. As they had expected, the Major comes in while McGuire and Mrs. Cordwell are in a perfectly innocent, though somewhat compromising attitude. A fight ensues and Lusk, watching from the outside, fires his gun and kills the major. McGuire is accused and runs to Julie for refuge. Running back to the hotel after seeing the major killed, Katie is made a prisoner by Lusk and Henri while they prepare to make a getaway. In her attempts to free herself Katie overturns a lamp and starts a fire which threatens to destroy the place. One of McGuire's brothers in the service is sent out to bring him in and on the way back to the village they are told that the hotel is burning and that Katie is locked in. McGuire saves the girl.

Many parts of the world are no better policed and the comparative freedom from fear of punishment makes these gentry bold and aggressive. Jack Holt, in the role of Robert Kendall, shows how a man who believes that the same conditions of comparative honesty and freedom from danger obtain on the island as elsewhere, and finds himself mistaken, runs into a situation where he has to take the law into his own hands. When out in one of his boats, he provides himself with a machine gun and in one encounter with pearl pirates, sinks their schooner when they try to drive him away from his own pearl concession.\"\n\nCast\nJack Holt as Robert Kendall\nSylvia Breamer as Rita Durand\nClarence Burton as Nilsson\nAnne Schaefer as Duenna\nJean De Briac as Perrier\nEdwin Stevens as Michaels\nWillard Louis as Governor of Papeete\n\nFilming troubles\nFrom a period newspaper:\n\"Famous Plea Fruitless.\n\"Don't give up the ship.\"\nThis time this was not the appeal of the famous Perry, but Clarence Burton's instructions, and he found them difficult to carry out, especially when the ship gave him up-by sinking. Burton, together with a gang of men who took the parts of pearl divers, was in command of a pearling tug in the new Paramount picture, \"The Man Unconquerable.\" As usual, Burton was the villain. Jack Holt,\nthe star of the picture, in an armed launch gave him battle. Presently the tug commenced to sink, faster than they had intended.\n\"Stick to it!\" yelled Joseph Henabery, the director, hurrying to get the close-ups. But before he could arrive on the scene the tug had gone under. The only close-ups he secured were of Burton and his pearl divers splashing about on the surface trying to remove their clothes so that they could remain afloat. One of the deck hands on the photographer's boat stood by with a boat hook to pull\nthem out when they showed signs of going down for the third time. In order to get a good \"shot\" of the sinking boat it was necessary to drag it by chains to shallow water at high tide and repair it at low tide. For four days a crew of laborers worked at the job; then they sat disgustedly on the beach while they watched the tug towed out to sea again and resunk -this time, properly and with due regard to the fans.\"\n\nFilming locations\nBeach scenes were shot along Balboa Beach in California.\n\nAnswer the question based on the given passages.

However, in 2009, Rollin began preparation foe Le masque de la M\u00e9duse. Rollin originally directed the film as a one-hour short, which was screened at the Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que de Toulouse, but after the release, Rollin decided to add 20 minutes of additional scenes and then cut the film into two distinct parts, as he did with his first feature, Le Viol du Vampire.  The film was shot on location at the Golden Gate Aquarium and P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery, as well as on stage at the Theatre du Grande Guignol, which is where the longest part of the film takes place. It was shot on HD video on a low budget of \u20ac150,000. Before the release, it was transferred to 35mm film.\n\nRelease\nThe film was not released theatrically, although it premiered on 19 November 2009 at the 11th edition of the Extreme Cinema Film Festival at the Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que de Toulouse. As part of \"An Evening with Jean Rollin\", it was shown as a double feature with Rollin's 2007 film La nuit des horloges.\n\nHome media\nNo official DVD was released, although for a limited time, a DVD of La masque de la M\u00e9duse was included with the first 150 copies of Rollin's book Jean Rollin: \u00c9crits complets Volume 1.\nPassage 3:\nCode of the Mounted\nThe Code of the Mounted is a 1935 American drama film directed by Sam Newfield from a screenplay by Milton Raison.  The film stars Kermit Maynard, Robert Warwick, and Jim Thorpe.\n\nCast\nPlot\nRaoul Marlin kills a fur trapper, and is captured and imprisoned by members of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.  Snaky, a member of his gang, kills the two Mounties guarding him, and helps him escape, but another Mountie, Jim Wilson, tracks him down and recaptures him. However, as they are making their way back to jail, more members of the gang Marlin belongs to, including the gang's leader, Jean, waylay them and free Marlin once again. Wilson and his partner, Rogers, begin tracking the gang down. The trail leads them to a general store which is owned by Duval, who is Jean's second-in-command, as well as being in love with her. Wilson hatches a plan to go undercover and impersonate a notorious thief and murderer, Benet.  When he gets to the store, he witnesses Duval kill an Indian, when the Indian refuses to sell his furs for fifty cents each. Jean tells him to get out of there, but Wilson gives her his story of being Benet, and wanting to partner with her and split the black market in the region with her. Wilson's cover is further bolstered when Rogers begins spreading a \"rumor\" around town that Wilson is Benet.  After spreading the rumor, Rogers leaves to go get more Mounties to help break up the gang. \nDuval, jealous of the attention Jean is bestowing on Wilson/Benet, as well as being upset over being shut out of their deal, begins to dig into Benet's history.  At the newspaper office, he finds out that the real Benet had been hung a short time earlier.  He takes the newspaper article to Jean, who is furious, and gathers her gang to go after Wilson. Just as they are about to hunt Wilson down, Rogers and the others Mounties arrive. Most of the gang is arrested, but Jean and Marlin escape.  Wilson takes out after the two.  As he catches up with them, Marlin gets a bead on him, but is shot and killed by Jean, who has developed feelings for Wilson. In exchange, Wilson lets Jean escape.\n\nProduction\nThis was the fifth production of a work by James Oliver Curwood starring Kermit Maynard.  It went into production on May 9, 1935, directed by Sam Neufeld.  It was scheduled for a June 8 release, and opened on time.\n\nReception\nThe Film Daily gave it a positive review, calling it an \"outdoor action story with better than usual attention to general production details\".  They complimented the scenery, Maynard's roping and riding skills, and felt it had enough action throughout, but went \"slightly overboard on dialogue and gunplay\".  The felt the direction was good, and the cinematography excellent.  In a brief review, the Motion Picture Herald gave it a lukewarm review, saying that the film was \"fair\", but the cinematography was \"excellent\", and Maynard's performance was \"well-liked\".\nPassage 4:\nQuerelle\nQuerelle is a 1982 West German-French English-language arthouse film directed by Rainer Werner Fassbinder and starring Brad Davis, adapted from French author Jean Genet's 1947 novel Querelle of Brest. It was Fassbinder's last film, released shortly after his death at the age of 37.\n\nPlot\nThe plot centers on the handsome Belgian sailor Georges Querelle, who is also a thief and murderer. When his ship, Le Vengeur, arrives in Brest, he visits the Feria, a bar and brothel for sailors run by the Madame Lysiane, whose lover, Robert, is Querelle's brother. Querelle has a love/hate relationship with his brother: when they meet at La Feria, they embrace, but also punch one another slowly and repeatedly in the belly. Lysiane's husband Nono works behind the bar and also manages La Feria's underhanded affairs with the assistance of his friend, the corrupt police captain Mario.\nQuerelle makes a deal to sell opium to Nono. During the execution of the deal, he murders his accomplice Vic by slitting his throat.  After delivering the drugs, Querelle announces that he wants to sleep with Lysiane.  He knows that this means he will have to throw dice with Nono, who has the privilege of playing a game of chance with all of her prospective lovers. If Nono loses, the suitor is allowed to proceed with his affair. If the suitor loses, however, he must submit to anal sex with Nono first, according to Nono's maxim that \"That way, I can say my wife only sleeps with arseholes.\" Querelle deliberately loses the game, allowing himself to be sodomized by Nono. When Nono gloats about Querelle's \"loss\" to Robert, who won his dice game, the brothers end up in a violent fight.  Later, Querelle becomes Lysiane's lover, and also has sex with Mario.\nLuckily for Querelle, a builder, Gil, murders his work mate Theo, who had been harassing and sexually assaulting him.  Gil hides from the police in an abandoned prison, and Roger, who is in love with Gil, establishes contact between Querelle and Gil in the hopes that Querelle can help Gil flee. Querelle falls in love with Gil, who closely resembles his brother.  Gil returns his affections, but Querelle betrays Gil by tipping off the police. Querelle cleverly arranged it so that the murder of Vic is also blamed on Gil.\nQuerelle's superior, Lieutenant Seblon, is in love with Querelle, and constantly tries to prove his manliness to him. Seblon is aware that Querelle murdered Vic, but chooses to protect him.  Later, Seblon reveals his love and concern to a drunken Querelle, and they kiss and embrace before returning to Le Vengeur.\n\nCast\nBrad Davis as Querelle\nFranco Nero as Lieutenant Seblon\nJeanne Moreau as Lysiane\nLaurent Malet as Roger Bataille\nHanno P\u00f6schl as Robert / Gil\nG\u00fcnther Kaufmann as Nono\nBurkhard Driest as Mario\nRoger Fritz as Marcellin\nDieter Schidor as Vic Rivette\nNatja Brunckhorst as Paulette\nWerner Asam as Worker\nAxel Bauer as Worker\nNeil Bell as Theo\nRobert van Ackeren as Drunken legionnaire\nWolf Gremm as Drunken legionnaire\nFrank Ripploh as Drunken legionnaire\n\nProduction\nAccording to Genet's biographer Edmund White, Querelle was originally going to be made by Werner Schroeter, with a scenario by Burkhard Driest, and produced by Dieter Schidor. However, Schidor could not find the money to finance a film by Schroeter, and therefore turned to other directors, including John Schlesinger and Sam Peckinpah, before finally settling on Fassbinder. Driest wrote a radically different script for Fassbinder, who then \"took the linear narrative and jumbled it up\". White quotes Schidor as saying \"Fassbinder did something totally different, he took the words of Genet and tried to meditate on something other than the story. The story became totally unimportant for him. He also said publicly that the story was a sort of third-rate police story that wouldn't be worth making a movie about without putting a particular moral impact into it\".Schroeter had wanted to make a black and white film with amateur actors and location shots, but Fassbinder instead shot it with professional actors in a lurid, expressionist color, and on sets in the studio. Edmund White comments that the result is a film in which, \"Everything is bathed in an artificial light and the architectural elements are all symbolic.\"\n\nSoundtrack\nJeanne Moreau \u2013 \"Each Man Kills the Things He Loves\" (music by Peer Raben, lyrics from Oscar Wilde's poem \"The Ballad of Reading Gaol\")\n\"Young and Joyful Bandit\" (Music by Peer Raben, lyrics by Jeanne Moreau)Both songs were nominated to the 1984 Razzie Awards for \"Worst Original Song\".\n\nRelease\nQuerelle sold more than 100,000 tickets in the first three weeks after its release in Paris, the first time that a film with a gay theme had achieved such success. On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, which categorizes reviews as positive or negative only, the film has an approval rating of 57% calculated based on 14 critics comments. By comparison, with the same opinions being calculated using a weighted arithmetic mean, the rating is 6.10/10. Writing for The New York Times critic Vincent Canby noted that Querelle was \"a mess...a detour that leads to a dead end.\"\nPenny Ashbrook calls Querelle Fassbinder's \"perfect epitaph: an intensely personal statement that is the most uncompromising portrayal of gay male sensibility to come from a major filmmaker.\" Edmund White considers Querelle the only film based on Genet's book that works, calling it \"visually as artificial and menacing as Genet's prose.\" Genet, in discussion with Schidor, said that he had not seen the film, commenting \"You can't smoke at the movies.\"\nPassage 5:\nThulasi (1987 film)\nThulasi is a 1987 Indian Tamil-language romantic drama film directed by Ameerjan.

He is best known for his portrayal of Abraham Lincoln in D.W. Griffith's controversial 1915 silent historical epic The Birth of a Nation.\n\nEarly years\nHenabery was born in Omaha and raised in Los Angeles. He began acting as an amateur in California. Before he worked in films, Henabery worked for the San Pedro, Los Angeles, Salt Lake Railroad. When he was 25 years old, he became an extra for Universal Pictures.\n\nCareer\nHenabery's acting career began in The Joke on Yellentown (1914).  From 1914 to 1917 he appeared in seventeen films, including his portrayal of Lincoln in The Birth of a Nation.\nHenabery also worked as a second-unit director on Griffith's Intolerance (1916), and supervised the filming of at least one extended sequence that appeared in the film. Henabery also acted as Admiral de Coligny in the Renaissance French portion of the film depicting the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre. Throughout the rest of his career, he worked as a director. From the mid-1920s, and after professional disagreements with both Louis B. Mayer at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Adolph Zukor at Paramount Pictures, Henabery found employment as a director for smaller Hollywood studios. \nIn 1931 he joined the Vitaphone studio in New York City, where he directed dozens of short subjects for the next 10 years. Most of them were musicals and comedies, featuring a host of popular singers in 20-minute sketches. Henabery remained with Vitaphone until the New York studio closed in 1940.\nHenabery made documentaries and training films as a member of the Army Signal Corps.\n\nAs Abraham Lincoln\nAlthough Henabery's impersonation of Lincoln was a masterpiece of facial makeup, the 6'1\" (185 cm) Henabery was three inches shorter than the 6'4\" (193 cm) Lincoln. Kevin Brownlow's book The Parade's Gone By (1968) contains a photo of Henabery in costume and makeup as Lincoln, seated in a chair with planks placed on the floor under Henabery's feet so that his knees are raised several inches; this effect (with the planks kept off-camera in the movie) made Henabery's legs appear longer than they actually were.\n\nPersonal life and death\nHenabery and his wife, Lilian, had a daughter and a son. Henabery died on February 18, 1976, aged 88, at the Motion Picture Country House in Los Angeles, California.\n\nFilmography\nDirector\nActor\nThe Race War (1915) with Bessie Buskirk\nPassage 8:\nMcGuire of the Mounted\nMcGuire of the Mounted is a 1923 American crime film directed by Richard Stanton and written by George Hively.

Andre tells him that he does not know who his assailant was, but describes him as best he can. Later McGuire and Julie become engaged and the old man dies from the effects of the wounds. Bill Lusk (Louis), the proprietor of the village saloon and dance hall, is in league with Decker (Johnson), who is engaged in smuggling dope over the border. They find that McGuire is on to them and plot to make him one of them so that they can continue their traffic unhampered. Katie (James), who Decker has in his power because of certain knowledge he possesses, is forced to put some drug in McGuire's punch while he is at the ball held that night in honor of the new wife (Browne) of Major Cordwell's (Lowery), who has just arrived. When McGuire wakes the next morning, he is horror-struck to learn that he is married to Katie. Katie finally comes to love McGuire, though he can never find it in him to forget his Julie. She refuses to carry on any further with the plans of Lusk and Decker, so they plan a new way of getting McGuire. They tell Katie that he is in love with Major Cordwell's wife and are ready to prove it if she will invite her to her house. They also tell the major to be present. As they had expected, the Major comes in while McGuire and Mrs. Cordwell are in a perfectly innocent, though somewhat compromising attitude. A fight ensues and Lusk, watching from the outside, fires his gun and kills the major. McGuire is accused and runs to Julie for refuge. Running back to the hotel after seeing the major killed, Katie is made a prisoner by Lusk and Henri while they prepare to make a getaway. In her attempts to free herself Katie overturns a lamp and starts a fire which threatens to destroy the place. One of McGuire's brothers in the service is sent out to bring him in and on the way back to the village they are told that the hotel is burning and that Katie is locked in. McGuire saves the girl. She is fatally burned, however, but before dying tells who the guilty party is.\n\nCast\nPreservation\nWith no prints of McGuire of the Mounted located in any film archives, it is a lost film.\nPassage 9:\nMcKenna of the Mounted\nMcKenna of the Mounted is a 1932 American pre-Code Western film directed by D.

Many parts of the world are no better policed and the comparative freedom from fear of punishment makes these gentry bold and aggressive. Jack Holt, in the role of Robert Kendall, shows how a man who believes that the same conditions of comparative honesty and freedom from danger obtain on the island as elsewhere, and finds himself mistaken, runs into a situation where he has to take the law into his own hands. When out in one of his boats, he provides himself with a machine gun and in one encounter with pearl pirates, sinks their schooner when they try to drive him away from his own pearl concession.\"\n\nCast\nJack Holt as Robert Kendall\nSylvia Breamer as Rita Durand\nClarence Burton as Nilsson\nAnne Schaefer as Duenna\nJean De Briac as Perrier\nEdwin Stevens as Michaels\nWillard Louis as Governor of Papeete\n\nFilming troubles\nFrom a period newspaper:\n\"Famous Plea Fruitless.\n\"Don't give up the ship.\"\nThis time this was not the appeal of the famous Perry, but Clarence Burton's instructions, and he found them difficult to carry out, especially when the ship gave him up-by sinking. Burton, together with a gang of men who took the parts of pearl divers, was in command of a pearling tug in the new Paramount picture, \"The Man Unconquerable.\" As usual, Burton was the villain. Jack Holt,\nthe star of the picture, in an armed launch gave him battle. Presently the tug commenced to sink, faster than they had intended.\n\"Stick to it!\" yelled Joseph Henabery, the director, hurrying to get the close-ups. But before he could arrive on the scene the tug had gone under. The only close-ups he secured were of Burton and his pearl divers splashing about on the surface trying to remove their clothes so that they could remain afloat. One of the deck hands on the photographer's boat stood by with a boat hook to pull\nthem out when they showed signs of going down for the third time. In order to get a good \"shot\" of the sinking boat it was necessary to drag it by chains to shallow water at high tide and repair it at low tide. For four days a crew of laborers worked at the job; then they sat disgustedly on the beach while they watched the tug towed out to sea again and resunk -this time, properly and with due regard to the fans.\"\n\nFilming locations\nBeach scenes were shot along Balboa Beach in California.", "answers": ["Mcguire Of The Mounted"], "length": 3854, "dataset": "2wikimqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "0df95375e082998e11c14660675ca1d4d28cbf40c094fa47", "pred": " The Man Unconquerable.

This type of painting that deals with multiple rhythms, colors, and angles, offers viewers a higher-dimensional experience. Billmyer has created patterns in and out of divided planes that go in independent directions before receding back into the canvas, which is his unique adaption of Hofmann\u2019s methods. Many of his patterns and forms appear in the film \u201cThe Hypercube: Projections and Slicing.\u201d Billmyer has taught and lectured at the New York School of Interior Design, The Hudson River School, Spellman College, Miami Art Center,  the Naskeay School, Maine, and his own New York School.\nPassage 3:\nJohn Charles Moore Grant, 9th Baron de Longueuil\nJohn Charles Moore de Bienville Grant, 9th Baron de Longueuil was born in 1861 at Bath, Somerset.

Vignola\nRobert G. Vignola (born Rocco Giuseppe Vignola, August 7, 1882 \u2013 October 25, 1953) was an Italian-American actor, screenwriter, and film director. A former stage actor, he appeared in many motion pictures produced by Kalem Company and later moved to directing, becoming one of the silent screen's most prolific directors. He directed a handful of films in the early years of talkies but his career essentially ended in the silent era.\n\nEarly life\nVignola was born in August 7, 1882 in Trivigno, a village in the province of Potenza, Basilicata, to Donato Gaetano Vignola, a stone mason, and Anna Rosa Rago.  It is unsure why he used August 5th as his birthday in America. He had two brothers and three sisters, his oldest sister having died at the age of 19 months in Italy. Travelling with his mother and siblings, he left Italy in May 1886, at the age of three. He was raised in Albany, New York. Because of his Christian name of Rocco he was nicknamed \"Rocky\" on the family\u2019s first census in New York. His name Rocco was later changed to Robert. Trained as a barber in his youth, Vignola by age 14 became interested in the circus, practicing contortion and slackwire. Three years later, in 1899, he found his true vocation\u2014acting\u2014and the following year in Albany he established a small performance company that he named \"The Empire Dramatic Club\".\n\nActing career\nIn 1901 he started acting on stage professionally and joined the \"American Stock Company\" in New York. He made his stage debut in \"Romeo and Juliet\", performing with Eleanor Robson Belmont and Kyrle Bellew. In the following years he played leads and became a character actor. Vignola's motion picture career began in 1906 with the short film The Black Hand, directed by Wallace McCutcheon and produced by Biograph Company, generally considered the film that launched the mafia genre.In 1907 he joined Kalem Studios, starring in numerous movies directed by his long-time friend Sidney Olcott often dealing with Irish culture such as The Lad from Old Ireland (1910), The Colleen Bawn (1911), and Arrah-na-Pogue (1911). Olcott would later promote him to assistant director. The Kalem Company traveled across Europe and Middle East, where Vignola did one of his most notable roles as Judas Iscariot in From the Manger to the Cross (1912), among the most acclaimed films of the silent years. According to Moving Picture World, he was the first actor who was placed upon a permanent salary by Kalem.\n\nDirecting career\nVignola directed 110 pictures from 1911 to 1937. His debut as a film director was Rory O'More (1911), co-directed with Olcott. The Vampire (1913), starring Alice Hollister, was well-received by critics and is sometimes cited as the earliest surviving \"vamp\" movie (another title with the same name produced by William Nicholas Selig in 1910 is considered lost). He returned to the theme with The Vampire's Trail (1914), featuring Alice Joyce, Tom Moore and Hollister in a secondary role. He had a long association directing the early movies of Pauline Frederick such as Audrey (1916), Double Crossed (1917), and The Love That Lives (1917).\nVignola is best known for directing Marion Davies in several romantic comedies including Enchantment (1921), Beauty's Worth (1922), and the big-budget epic When Knighthood Was in Flower (1922), which achieved critical and commercial acclaim and established Davies as a movie star. In 1920, he was offered the role of director-general for the Kinkikan Cinematograph Company in Japan and was honored as \"outstanding director of the year\" by Frederick James Smith of the Motion Picture Classic in 1921. The Woman God Changed (1921) and Adam and Eva (1923) were praised for the \"innovative\" use of shadows and lighting effects.With the arrival of the sound era, he directed Broken Dreams (1933), in competition for the Best Foreign Film at the 2nd Venice International Film Festival, and The Scarlet Letter (1934), the last film of Colleen Moore. His sound films were not successful and Vignola retired. His final film work was The Girl from Scotland Yard (1937).  Later that year he directed The Pilgrimage Play (live play in Los Angeles, not the related movie.).  Vignola was associated with the play at least to 1944.\n\nDeath\nVignola died in Hollywood, California in 1953. He was buried in St. Agnes Cemetery, Menands, New York.\n\nPersonal life\nHe lived in a mansion at Whitley Heights owned by William Randolph Hearst. According to legend, Hearst's mistress Marion Davies was allowed to stay without him at Vignola's mansion, worried that she was having affairs and considering Vignola a trusted companion for her as he was homosexual. Sidney Olcott, alone after the passing of his wife Valentine Grant, spent his later life at Vignola's home, where he died in 1949.Vignola was described by Delight Evans as \"the sanest and least temperamental of all celluloid creators. He has infinite patience. He has one quality which makes actors want to work for him: consideration.\" He once said: \"Before a director can learn to control thousands of people and big stars and big scenes, he must first learn to control himself.\" He identified himself as a Republican, although he was not much interested in politics. Vignola visited his birthplace Trivigno with his family, provided money to build the town's war monument and maintained correspondence with some of his relatives.\n\nPartial filmography\nActor\nDirector\nPassage 4:\nShe Wants Me\nShe Wants Me is a 2012 comedy film written and directed by Rob Margolies and starring Josh Gad and Kristen Ruhlin.\n\nPlot\nSam is a writer working on a feature film.

Vignola\nRobert G. Vignola (born Rocco Giuseppe Vignola, August 7, 1882 \u2013 October 25, 1953) was an Italian-American actor, screenwriter, and film director. A former stage actor, he appeared in many motion pictures produced by Kalem Company and later moved to directing, becoming one of the silent screen's most prolific directors. He directed a handful of films in the early years of talkies but his career essentially ended in the silent era.\n\nEarly life\nVignola was born in August 7, 1882 in Trivigno, a village in the province of Potenza, Basilicata, to Donato Gaetano Vignola, a stone mason, and Anna Rosa Rago.  It is unsure why he used August 5th as his birthday in America. He had two brothers and three sisters, his oldest sister having died at the age of 19 months in Italy. Travelling with his mother and siblings, he left Italy in May 1886, at the age of three. He was raised in Albany, New York. Because of his Christian name of Rocco he was nicknamed \"Rocky\" on the family\u2019s first census in New York. His name Rocco was later changed to Robert. Trained as a barber in his youth, Vignola by age 14 became interested in the circus, practicing contortion and slackwire. Three years later, in 1899, he found his true vocation\u2014acting\u2014and the following year in Albany he established a small performance company that he named \"The Empire Dramatic Club\".\n\nActing career\nIn 1901 he started acting on stage professionally and joined the \"American Stock Company\" in New York. He made his stage debut in \"Romeo and Juliet\", performing with Eleanor Robson Belmont and Kyrle Bellew. In the following years he played leads and became a character actor. Vignola's motion picture career began in 1906 with the short film The Black Hand, directed by Wallace McCutcheon and produced by Biograph Company, generally considered the film that launched the mafia genre.In 1907 he joined Kalem Studios, starring in numerous movies directed by his long-time friend Sidney Olcott often dealing with Irish culture such as The Lad from Old Ireland (1910), The Colleen Bawn (1911), and Arrah-na-Pogue (1911). Olcott would later promote him to assistant director. The Kalem Company traveled across Europe and Middle East, where Vignola did one of his most notable roles as Judas Iscariot in From the Manger to the Cross (1912), among the most acclaimed films of the silent years. According to Moving Picture World, he was the first actor who was placed upon a permanent salary by Kalem.\n\nDirecting career\nVignola directed 110 pictures from 1911 to 1937. His debut as a film director was Rory O'More (1911), co-directed with Olcott. The Vampire (1913), starring Alice Hollister, was well-received by critics and is sometimes cited as the earliest surviving \"vamp\" movie (another title with the same name produced by William Nicholas Selig in 1910 is considered lost). He returned to the theme with The Vampire's Trail (1914), featuring Alice Joyce, Tom Moore and Hollister in a secondary role. He had a long association directing the early movies of Pauline Frederick such as Audrey (1916), Double Crossed (1917), and The Love That Lives (1917).\nVignola is best known for directing Marion Davies in several romantic comedies including Enchantment (1921), Beauty's Worth (1922), and the big-budget epic When Knighthood Was in Flower (1922), which achieved critical and commercial acclaim and established Davies as a movie star. In 1920, he was offered the role of director-general for the Kinkikan Cinematograph Company in Japan and was honored as \"outstanding director of the year\" by Frederick James Smith of the Motion Picture Classic in 1921. The Woman God Changed (1921) and Adam and Eva (1923) were praised for the \"innovative\" use of shadows and lighting effects.With the arrival of the sound era, he directed Broken Dreams (1933), in competition for the Best Foreign Film at the 2nd Venice International Film Festival, and The Scarlet Letter (1934), the last film of Colleen Moore. His sound films were not successful and Vignola retired. His final film work was The Girl from Scotland Yard (1937).  Later that year he directed The Pilgrimage Play (live play in Los Angeles, not the related movie.).  Vignola was associated with the play at least to 1944.\n\nDeath\nVignola died in Hollywood, California in 1953. He was buried in St. Agnes Cemetery, Menands, New York.\n\nPersonal life\nHe lived in a mansion at Whitley Heights owned by William Randolph Hearst. According to legend, Hearst's mistress Marion Davies was allowed to stay without him at Vignola's mansion, worried that she was having affairs and considering Vignola a trusted companion for her as he was homosexual. Sidney Olcott, alone after the passing of his wife Valentine Grant, spent his later life at Vignola's home, where he died in 1949.Vignola was described by Delight Evans as \"the sanest and least temperamental of all celluloid creators. He has infinite patience. He has one quality which makes actors want to work for him: consideration.\" He once said: \"Before a director can learn to control thousands of people and big stars and big scenes, he must first learn to control himself.\" He identified himself as a Republican, although he was not much interested in politics. Vignola visited his birthplace Trivigno with his family, provided money to build the town's war monument and maintained correspondence with some of his relatives.\n\nPartial filmography\nActor\nDirector\nPassage 4:\nShe Wants Me\nShe Wants Me is a 2012 comedy film written and directed by Rob Margolies and starring Josh Gad and Kristen Ruhlin.\n\nPlot\nSam is a writer working on a feature film.

In 1910, Pabst traveled to the United States, where he worked as an actor and director at the German Theater in New York City.In 1914, he decided to become a director, and he returned to recruit actors in Europe. Pabst was in France when World War I began, he was arrested and held as an enemy alien and interned in a prisoner-of-war camp near Brest. While imprisoned, Pabst organised a theatre group at the camp and directed French-language plays. Upon his release in 1919, he returned to Vienna, where he became director of the Neue Wiener B\u00fchne, an avant-garde theatre.\n\nCareer\nPabst began his career as a film director at the behest of Carl Froelich who hired Pabst as an assistant director. He directed his first film, The Treasure, in 1923. He developed a talent for \"discovering\" and developing the talents of actresses, including Greta Garbo, Asta Nielsen, Louise Brooks, and Leni Riefenstahl.Pabst's best known films concern the plight of women, including The Joyless Street (1925) with Greta Garbo and Asta Nielsen, Secrets of a Soul (1926) with Lili Damita, The Loves of Jeanne Ney (1927) with Brigitte Helm, and Pandora's Box (1929) and Diary of a Lost Girl (1929) with American actress Louise Brooks. He also co-directed with Arnold Fanck a mountain film entitled The White Hell of Pitz Palu (1929) starring Leni Riefenstahl.\nAfter the coming of sound, he made a trilogy of films that secured his reputation: Westfront 1918 (1930), The Threepenny Opera (1931) with Lotte Lenya (based on the Bertolt Brecht and Kurt Weill musical), and Kameradschaft (1931). Pabst also filmed three versions of Pierre Benoit's novel L'Atlantide in 1932, in German, English, and French, titled Die Herrin von Atlantis, The Mistress of Atlantis, and L'Atlantide, respectively. In 1933, Pabst directed Don Quixote, once again in German, English, and French versions.\nAfter making A Modern Hero (1934) in the USA and Street of Shadows (1937) in France, Pabst (who was planning to emigrate to the United States) was caught in France in 1939, when war was declared, whilst visiting his mother, and was forced to return to Nazi Germany. Under the auspices of propaganda minister, Josef Goebbels, Pabst made two films in Germany during this period: The Comedians (1941) and Paracelsus (1943).\nPabst directed four opera productions in Italy in 1953: La forza del destino for the Maggio Musicale Fiorentino in Florence (conducted by Dimitri Mitropoulos, the cast included Renata Tebaldi, Fedora Barbieri, Mario del Monaco, Aldo Protti, Cesare Siepi), and a few weeks later, for the Arena di Verona Festival, a spectacular A\u00efda, with Maria Callas in the title role (conducted by Tullio Serafin, with del Monaco), Il trovatore and again La forza del destino.He directed The Last Ten Days (1955), the first post-war German feature film to feature Adolf Hitler as a character.\n\nDeath\nOn 29 May 1967, Pabst died in Vienna at the age of 81. He was interred at the Zentralfriedhof in Vienna.\n\nAwards\n1941, Venice Film Festival: Gold Medal of the Biennale for Best Director for his film The Comedians\n\nFilmography\nSee also\nMax Deutsch, composer\nPassage 10:\nDevil in the Flesh 2\nDevil in the Flesh 2 (also known as Teacher's Pet) is a 2000 erotic thriller film directed by Marcus Spiegel.

His work can be found in the collections of the Canada Council, the Indian Art Centre, Indian and Northern Affairs Canada, the Canadian Native Arts Foundation (now Indspire), the Woodland Cultural Center, the City of Ottawa, the Ottawa Art Gallery and the International Museum of Electrography.\n\nCuratorial career\nHill serves as the Audain Senior Curator of Indigenous Art at the National Gallery of Canada.\n\nAwards and honours\nIn 2018, Hill received the Indspire Award for Arts.\nPassage 2:\nJohn McMahon (Surrey and Somerset cricketer)\nJohn William Joseph McMahon (28 December 1917 \u2013 8 May 2001) was an Australian-born first-class cricketer who played for Surrey and Somerset County Cricket Clubs in England from 1947 to 1957.\n\nSurrey cricketer\nMcMahon was an orthodox left-arm spin bowler with much variation in speed and flight who was spotted by Surrey playing in club cricket in North London and brought on to the county's staff for the 1947 season at the age of 29. In the first innings of his first match, against Lancashire at The Oval, he took five wickets for 81 runs.In his first full season, 1948, he was Surrey's leading wicket-taker and in the last home game of the season he was awarded his county cap \u2013 he celebrated by taking eight Northamptonshire wickets for 46 runs at The Oval, six of them coming in the space of 6.3 overs for seven runs. This would remain the best bowling performance of his first-class career, not surpassed, but he did equal it seven years later. In the following game, the last away match of the season, he took 10 Hampshire wickets for 150 runs in the match at Bournemouth. In the 1948 season as a whole, he took 91 wickets at an average of 28.07. As a tail-end left-handed batsman, he managed just 93 runs in the season at an average of 4.22.The emergence of Tony Lock as a slow left-arm bowler in 1949 brought a stuttering end of McMahon's Surrey career. Though he played in 12 first-class matches in the 1949 season, McMahon took only 19 wickets; a similar number of matches in 1950 brought 34 wickets. In 1951, he played just seven times and in 1952 only three times. In 1953, Lock split the first finger of his left hand, and played in only 11 of Surrey's County Championship matches; McMahon played as his deputy in 14 Championship matches, though a measure of their comparative merits was that Lock's 11 games produced 67 wickets at 12.38 runs apiece, while McMahon's 14 games brought him 45 wickets at the, for him, low average of 21.53. At the end of the 1953 season, McMahon was allowed to leave Surrey to join Somerset, then languishing at the foot of the County Championship and recruiting widely from other counties and other countries.\n\nSomerset cricketer\nSomerset's slow bowling in 1954 was in the hands of leg-spinner Johnny Lawrence, with support from the off-spin of Jim Hilton while promising off-spinner Brian Langford was on national service. McMahon filled a vacancy for a left-arm orthodox spinner that had been there since the retirement of Horace Hazell at the end of the 1952 season; Hazell's apparent successor, Roy Smith, had failed to realise his promise as a bowler in 1953, though his batting had advanced significantly.\nMcMahon instantly became a first-team regular and played in almost every match during his four years with the county, not missing a single Championship game until he was controversially dropped from the side in August 1957, after which he did not play in the Championship again.In the 1954 season, McMahon, alongside fellow newcomer Hilton, was something of a disappointment, according to Wisden: \"The new spin bowlers, McMahon and Hilton, did not attain to the best standards of their craft in a wet summer, yet, like the rest of the attack, they would have fared better with reasonable support in the field and from their own batsmen,\" it said. McMahon took 85 wickets at an average of 27.47 (Hilton took only 42 at a higher average). His best match was against Essex at Weston-super-Mare where he took six for 96 in the first innings and five for 45 in the second to finish with match figures of 11 for 141, which were the best of his career. He was awarded his county cap in the 1954 season, but Somerset remained at the bottom of the table.\nThe figures for the 1955 were similar: McMahon this time took 75 wickets at 28.77 apiece. There was a small improvement in his batting and the arrival of Bryan Lobb elevated McMahon to No 10 in the batting order for most of the season, and he responded with 262 runs and an average of 9.03. This included his highest-ever score, 24, made in the match against Sussex at Frome. A week later in Somerset's next match, he equalled his best-ever bowling performance, taking eight Kent wickets for 46 runs in the first innings of a match at Yeovil through what Wisden called \"clever variation of flight and spin\". These matches brought two victories for Somerset, but there were only two others in the 1955 season and the side finished at the bottom of the Championship for the fourth season running.At the end of the 1955 season, Lawrence retired and McMahon became Somerset's senior spin bowler for the 1956 season, with Langford returning from National Service as the main support. McMahon responded with his most successful season so far, taking 103 wickets at an average of 25.57, the only season in his career in which he exceeded 100 wickets. The bowling average improved still further in 1957 to 23.10 when McMahon took 86 wickets. But his season came to an abrupt end in mid-August 1957 when, after 108 consecutive Championship matches, he was dropped from the first team during the Weston-super-Mare festival. Though he played some games for the second eleven later in August, he regained his place in the first team for only a single end-of-season friendly match, and he was told that his services were not required for the future, a decision, said Wisden, that \"proved highly controversial\".\n\nSacked by Somerset\nThe reason behind McMahon's sacking did not become public knowledge for many years. In its obituary of him in 2002, McMahon was described by Wisden as \"a man who embraced the antipodean virtues of candour and conviviality\". It went on: \"Legend tells of a night at the Flying Horse Inn in Nottingham when he beheaded the gladioli with an ornamental sword, crying: 'When Mac drinks, everybody drinks!'\" The obituary recounts a further escapade in second eleven match at Midsomer Norton where a curfew imposed on the team was circumvented by \"a POW-type loop\" organised by McMahon, \"with his team-mates escaping through a ground-storey window and then presenting themselves again\". As the only Somerset second eleven match that McMahon played in at Midsomer Norton was right at the end of the 1957 season, this may have been the final straw. But in any case there had been \"an embarrassing episode at Swansea's Grand Hotel\" earlier in the season, also involving Jim Hilton, who was also dismissed at the end of the season. Team-mates and club members petitioned for McMahon to be reinstated, but the county club was not to be moved.\nAfter a period in Lancashire League cricket with Milnrow Cricket Club, McMahon moved back to London where he did office work, later contributing some articles to cricket magazines.\n\n\n== Notes and references ==\nPassage 3:\nWale Adebanwi\nWale Adebanwi (born 1969) is a Nigerian-born first Black Rhodes Professor at St Antony's College, Oxford where he was, until June 2021, a Professor of Race Relations, and the Director of the African Studies Centre, School of Interdisciplinary Area Studies, and a Governing Board Fellow.

He went to England at the end of World War II as a member of the Royal Air Force, and settled in Kidderminster in Worcestershire in 1947, where he worked as a civilian lorry driver for the RAF. He began playing for Kidderminster Cricket Club in the Birmingham League, and at the start of the 1952 season, opening the bowling for the club's senior team, he had figures of 7 for 9 and 7 for 37.Worcestershire invited him to play for them, and he made his first-class debut against Sussex in July 1952. He took five wickets in the match (his maiden victim being Ken Suttle) and then held on for 4 not out with Peter Richardson (20 not out) to add the 12 runs needed for a one-wicket victory after his county had collapsed from 192 for 2 to 238 for 9. A week later he claimed four wickets against Warwickshire, then a few days later still he managed 6 for 52 (five of his victims bowled) in what was otherwise a disastrous innings defeat to Derbyshire. In the last match of the season he took a career-best 6 for 51 against Glamorgan; he and Reg Perks (4 for 59) bowled unchanged throughout the first innings. Worcestershire won the game and Lobban finished the season with 23 wickets at 23.69.He took 23 wickets again in 1953, but at a considerably worse average of 34.43, and had only two really successful games: against Oxford University in June, when he took 5 for 70, and then against Sussex in July. On this occasion Lobban claimed eight wickets, his most in a match, including 6 for 103 in the first innings. He also made his highest score with the bat, 18, but Sussex won by five wickets.In 1954 Lobban made only two first-class appearances, and managed only the single wicket of Gloucestershire tail-ender Bomber Wells. In his final game, against Warwickshire at Dudley, his nine first-innings overs cost 51. He bowled just two overs in the second innings as Warwickshire completed an easy ten-wicket win. Lobban played one more Second XI game, against Glamorgan II at Cardiff Arms Park; in this he picked up five wickets.\nHe was also a professional boxer and played rugby union for Kidderminster.He later moved to Canada, where he worked as a teacher in Burnaby, British Columbia.

He was the son of the Reverend Edward Moore and Lady Harriet Janet Sarah Montagu-Scott, who was one of the daughters of the 4th Duke of Buccleuch. One of his brothers, Arthur, became an admiral and was knighted. Their great \ngrandfather was John Moore, Archbishop of Canterbury from 1783 to 1805. One of their sisters was a maid of honour to Queen Victoria.Moore went to New Zealand in the 1870s and lived in Geraldine and Christchurch. He married Henrietta Lysaght of H\u0101wera in November 1879, and they had one son. In May 1884 she died a few days after giving birth to a daughter, who also died.In 1886 Moore became a Justice of the Peace in Geraldine. In 1897 he married Alice Fish of Geraldine. They moved to England four years before his death in 1916.\n\nCricket career\nMoore was a right-handed middle-order batsman. In consecutive seasons, 1876\u201377 and 1877\u201378, playing for Canterbury, he made the highest score in the short New Zealand first-class season: 76 and 75 respectively. His 76 came in his first match for Canterbury, against Otago. He went to the wicket early on the first day with the score at 7 for 2 and put on 99 for the third wicket with Charles Corfe before he was out with the score at 106 for 3 after a \"very fine exhibition of free hitting, combined with good defence\". Canterbury were all out for 133, but went on to win the match. His 75 came in the next season's match against Otago, when he took the score from 22 for 2 to 136 for 6. The New Zealand cricket historian Tom Reese said, \"Right from the beginning he smote the bowling hip and thigh, going out of his ground to indulge in some forceful driving.\" Canterbury won again.Moore led the batting averages in the Canterbury Cricket Association in 1877\u201378 with 379 runs at an average of 34.4. Also in 1877\u201378, he was a member of the Canterbury team that inflicted the only defeat on the touring Australians. In 1896\u201397, at the age of 47, he top-scored in each innings for a South Canterbury XVIII against the touring Queensland cricket team.\n\nAnswer the question based on the given passages.

It went on: \"Legend tells of a night at the Flying Horse Inn in Nottingham when he beheaded the gladioli with an ornamental sword, crying: 'When Mac drinks, everybody drinks!'\" The obituary recounts a further escapade in second eleven match at Midsomer Norton where a curfew imposed on the team was circumvented by \"a POW-type loop\" organised by McMahon, \"with his team-mates escaping through a ground-storey window and then presenting themselves again\". As the only Somerset second eleven match that McMahon played in at Midsomer Norton was right at the end of the 1957 season, this may have been the final straw. But in any case there had been \"an embarrassing episode at Swansea's Grand Hotel\" earlier in the season, also involving Jim Hilton, who was also dismissed at the end of the season. Team-mates and club members petitioned for McMahon to be reinstated, but the county club was not to be moved.\nAfter a period in Lancashire League cricket with Milnrow Cricket Club, McMahon moved back to London where he did office work, later contributing some articles to cricket magazines.\n\n\n== Notes and references ==\nPassage 3:\nWale Adebanwi\nWale Adebanwi (born 1969) is a Nigerian-born first Black Rhodes Professor at St Antony's College, Oxford where he was, until June 2021, a Professor of Race Relations, and the Director of the African Studies Centre, School of Interdisciplinary Area Studies, and a Governing Board Fellow.

He took five wickets in the match (his maiden victim being Ken Suttle) and then held on for 4 not out with Peter Richardson (20 not out) to add the 12 runs needed for a one-wicket victory after his county had collapsed from 192 for 2 to 238 for 9.

He was the son of the Reverend Edward Moore and Lady Harriet Janet Sarah Montagu-Scott, who was one of the daughters of the 4th Duke of Buccleuch. One of his brothers, Arthur, became an admiral and was knighted. Their great \ngrandfather was John Moore, Archbishop of Canterbury from 1783 to 1805. One of their sisters was a maid of honour to Queen Victoria.Moore went to New Zealand in the 1870s and lived in Geraldine and Christchurch. He married Henrietta Lysaght of H\u0101wera in November 1879, and they had one son.

Canterbury were all out for 133, but went on to win the match. His 75 came in the next season's match against Otago, when he took the score from 22 for 2 to 136 for 6. The New Zealand cricket historian Tom Reese said, \"Right from the beginning he smote the bowling hip and thigh, going out of his ground to indulge in some forceful driving.\" Canterbury won again.Moore led the batting averages in the Canterbury Cricket Association in 1877\u201378 with 379 runs at an average of 34.4. Also in 1877\u201378, he was a member of the Canterbury team that inflicted the only defeat on the touring Australians.

The film was awarded with the Silver Bear at the 59th Berlin Film Festival.\n\nPlot\nGitti and Chris are a young German couple on vacation at Chris's family villa in Sardinia. Gitti is much more spontaneous and light-hearted than Chris, wanting to go out and try to make friends while Chris remains introverted, preferring to stay in and read, even hiding from his neighbour; her playful demeanor often annoys him, while his guarded attitude exasperates her. When he tries to speak to Gitti about his unhappy feelings about his life and career she interrupts him to say that he muses too much over everything and should consider settling down with her. Chris is upset and insulted by her outburst. Later, Gitti and Chris admit to each other that they often worry they're not the right person for each other.\nWhile shopping for groceries Chris spots Hans, a successful old classmate, and unsuccessfully tries to hide from him. Hans invites the couple to a barbecue at his home with his wife Sana, a successful fashion designer, which Gitti tries to decline as she has already received an invitation from a bohemian couple she has recently met. Chris overrides her and accepts the invitation. While Sana and Hans appear to be the perfect, thriving couple, they quickly prove to be obnoxious, bland, and vapid. Hans eventually reveals that Chris has declined an architecture prize because his design would be melded with another architect, though Chris had previously told Gitti that he hadn't heard back from the competition, which angers Gitti. When Gitti stands up for Chris in the face of Hans's subtle insults, Chris becomes upset.\nThe following day Chris is hyper critical of Gitti, taking her on a long hike during which they get lost. Afterwards he informs her that he will be going for a drink with Hans alone, as Gitti embarrassed him the previous evening. When he asks Gitti why she can't be more normal, like Sana, Gitti argues that she doesn't want to be like everybody else. Though Gitti begs him not to leave her alone at night, he goes anyway, returning in the morning. The following day Chris informs Gitti that he is considering taking an architecture job on the island. While Chris meets with his potential client, Gitti goes exploring on her own, trying out a new makeover and choosing to keep the dress she previously regarded as too \"bourgeoisie\" in an effort to please Chris. After meeting up with Chris by chance, he suggests they invite Hans and Sana to their home. The atmosphere becomes uncomfortable when Gitti runs into the bohemian couple she had previously met; they are put off by her new, put-together appearance and are somewhat hurt that she had stood them up. When they extend the invitation again, Chris clumsily declines, which annoys Gitti.\nGitti makes an effort to tone down her appearance and mannerisms for the dinner with Hans and Sana, but it nevertheless becomes awkward as Chris starts behaving oddly in an attempt to impress the other couple. Gitti becomes more uncomfortable when Chris takes them into his mother's private dream room and mocks her interests for Hans and Sana's amusement. At the end of the night, Hans playfully throws Sana into the villa pool, leading Chris to throw Gitti in as well even as she begs him not to. Upset, she asks Sana to make an excuse so that she and Hans will leave. Chris tells Gitti he loves her and initiates sex, which she accepts dispassionately.\nThe next day, Chris overhears Gitti concocting an excuse to leave early without letting him know. After confronting her, Gitti asserts that she is leaving him, and no longer loves him anymore because he is a weakling. Chris fires back that she is a naive hypocrite and asks her to leave. While packing her things, Gitti falls to the floor and plays dead. At first worried, and then upset by her games, Chris resolves to make things work and let his guard down. He blows raspberries into her stomach, which makes her laugh, and the two finally look at each other.\n\nCast\nBirgit Minichmayr as Gitti\nLars Eidinger as Chris\nNicole Marischka as Sana\nHans-Jochen Wagner as Hans\n\nRelease\nCritical reception\nThe film received positive reviews from film critics.

The film was awarded with the Silver Bear at the 59th Berlin Film Festival.\n\nPlot\nGitti and Chris are a young German couple on vacation at Chris's family villa in Sardinia. Gitti is much more spontaneous and light-hearted than Chris, wanting to go out and try to make friends while Chris remains introverted, preferring to stay in and read, even hiding from his neighbour; her playful demeanor often annoys him, while his guarded attitude exasperates her. When he tries to speak to Gitti about his unhappy feelings about his life and career she interrupts him to say that he muses too much over everything and should consider settling down with her. Chris is upset and insulted by her outburst. Later, Gitti and Chris admit to each other that they often worry they're not the right person for each other.\nWhile shopping for groceries Chris spots Hans, a successful old classmate, and unsuccessfully tries to hide from him. Hans invites the couple to a barbecue at his home with his wife Sana, a successful fashion designer, which Gitti tries to decline as she has already received an invitation from a bohemian couple she has recently met. Chris overrides her and accepts the invitation. While Sana and Hans appear to be the perfect, thriving couple, they quickly prove to be obnoxious, bland, and vapid. Hans eventually reveals that Chris has declined an architecture prize because his design would be melded with another architect, though Chris had previously told Gitti that he hadn't heard back from the competition, which angers Gitti. When Gitti stands up for Chris in the face of Hans's subtle insults, Chris becomes upset.\nThe following day Chris is hyper critical of Gitti, taking her on a long hike during which they get lost. Afterwards he informs her that he will be going for a drink with Hans alone, as Gitti embarrassed him the previous evening. When he asks Gitti why she can't be more normal, like Sana, Gitti argues that she doesn't want to be like everybody else. Though Gitti begs him not to leave her alone at night, he goes anyway, returning in the morning. The following day Chris informs Gitti that he is considering taking an architecture job on the island. While Chris meets with his potential client, Gitti goes exploring on her own, trying out a new makeover and choosing to keep the dress she previously regarded as too \"bourgeoisie\" in an effort to please Chris. After meeting up with Chris by chance, he suggests they invite Hans and Sana to their home. The atmosphere becomes uncomfortable when Gitti runs into the bohemian couple she had previously met; they are put off by her new, put-together appearance and are somewhat hurt that she had stood them up. When they extend the invitation again, Chris clumsily declines, which annoys Gitti.\nGitti makes an effort to tone down her appearance and mannerisms for the dinner with Hans and Sana, but it nevertheless becomes awkward as Chris starts behaving oddly in an attempt to impress the other couple. Gitti becomes more uncomfortable when Chris takes them into his mother's private dream room and mocks her interests for Hans and Sana's amusement. At the end of the night, Hans playfully throws Sana into the villa pool, leading Chris to throw Gitti in as well even as she begs him not to. Upset, she asks Sana to make an excuse so that she and Hans will leave. Chris tells Gitti he loves her and initiates sex, which she accepts dispassionately.\nThe next day, Chris overhears Gitti concocting an excuse to leave early without letting him know. After confronting her, Gitti asserts that she is leaving him, and no longer loves him anymore because he is a weakling. Chris fires back that she is a naive hypocrite and asks her to leave. While packing her things, Gitti falls to the floor and plays dead. At first worried, and then upset by her games, Chris resolves to make things work and let his guard down. He blows raspberries into her stomach, which makes her laugh, and the two finally look at each other.\n\nCast\nBirgit Minichmayr as Gitti\nLars Eidinger as Chris\nNicole Marischka as Sana\nHans-Jochen Wagner as Hans\n\nRelease\nCritical reception\nThe film received positive reviews from film critics.

He competed for the United States at the 1928 Summer Olympics in Amsterdam and also won the 100-yard and 220-yard sprints at the 1928 NCAA Men's Track and Field Championships.\n\nEarly life\nBracey grew up in Humble, Texas and attended Humble High School.  As a boy, he participated in games of \"hare-and-hound,\" in which the children would chase each other from one end of town to the other.  Bracey was so fast that rival sides would quarrel over who which side would have him.  He gained prominence as a runner at Humble High.\n\nRice University\nBracey attended Rice Institute located in Houston, Texas.  He competed in intercollegiate track for the Rice Owls from 1927 to 1930 and for the United States at the 1928 Summer Olympics in Amsterdam.  He was regarded as \"the first man to bring Rice Institute athletic fame.\"  Bracey was considered a \"big and rangy\" runner.  Between 1928 and 1929, he gained weight and was reported in 1929 to be six feet tall and approximately 160 pounds.  In 1929, Bracey described his minimalist approach to training as follows:\"Sprinters are born, not made, and running comes natural with me.  As long as I take care of myself and eat reasonably, I get along fine. I don't train any during the summer.  That's vacation time and I make it that by spending those weeks fishing.  Laying off like that doesn't bother me.  After all, a dash man doesn't need much wind.  I only take two or three breaths in 100 yards.\"\nA feature story published in 1929 described Bracey as \"almost a recluse,\" a quiet person who rarely left campus, never wears formal clothes, and \"thinks society is all wet.\"\n\nChampionships and records\nIn June 1928, Bracey won both sprint events at the 1928 NCAA Men's Track and Field Championships with times of 9.6 seconds in the 100-yard race and 20.9 seconds in the 220-yard race.  He was the first athlete from Rice to win an NCAA track championship in any event, and it was 1938 before another Rice athlete (Fred Wolcott) accomplished the feat.He qualified for the U.S. Olympic team in 1928 and traveled with the team to the 1928 Summer Olympics in Amsterdam.  He finished fifth in the semifinals of the 100-meter race at the Olympic games with a time of 10.8 seconds. He was the first Rice athlete to compete in the Olympic games; it was 1948 before another Rice athlete competed in the Olympics.At the Texas Relays in March 1929, Bracey tied the world record in the 100-yard sprint with a time of 9.5 seconds.  The next day, he ran the event in 9.4 seconds, but the record was not recognized due to wind conditions.  Football coach Knute Rockne officiated the sprint event in which Bracey's world record was disallowed due to wind conditions.  Rockne told reporters that Bracey was the best sprinter he had seen and added: \"Bracey is a streak.  He is as good as any of them off the marks and runs the last 40 yards faster than any man I ever saw.  He had the wind with him when he did 9.4 at Dallas but on both that occasion and the day before he beat George Simpson of Ohio State by about four yards.  You all know how good Simpson is.\"At the 1929 NCAA Men's Track and Field Championships, Bracey lost his title in the sprint events as Ohio State's George Simpson won both events, and Bracey finished second in the 100-yard race and third in the 220-yard event.Bracey continued to compete through 1932.  He tied the world record in the 100-meter race with a time of 10.4 seconds in June 1932.  In July 1932, he qualified in the preliminaries of the 100-meter and 200-meter events at the Far Western Olympic team trials at Long Beach, California.  However, he was taken to a hospital the following day after an attack of appendicitis and was unable to participate in the finals, which were held while he was in the hospital.\n\nDeath and posthumous honors\nBracey died in Buckeye, Arizona on September 23, 1940, leaving behind wife, Anna Bess Singleton Bracey and daughter, Linda Anne Bracey (Mulpagano) who was 4 months of age at the time of her father's death.In 1970, Bracey was selected as one of the initial inductees into the Rice Athletic Hall of Fame.\nPassage 3:\nJohn G.

He competed for the United States at the 1928 Summer Olympics in Amsterdam and also won the 100-yard and 220-yard sprints at the 1928 NCAA Men's Track and Field Championships.\n\nEarly life\nBracey grew up in Humble, Texas and attended Humble High School.  As a boy, he participated in games of \"hare-and-hound,\" in which the children would chase each other from one end of town to the other.  Bracey was so fast that rival sides would quarrel over who which side would have him.  He gained prominence as a runner at Humble High.\n\nRice University\nBracey attended Rice Institute located in Houston, Texas.  He competed in intercollegiate track for the Rice Owls from 1927 to 1930 and for the United States at the 1928 Summer Olympics in Amsterdam.  He was regarded as \"the first man to bring Rice Institute athletic fame.\"  Bracey was considered a \"big and rangy\" runner.  Between 1928 and 1929, he gained weight and was reported in 1929 to be six feet tall and approximately 160 pounds.  In 1929, Bracey described his minimalist approach to training as follows:\"Sprinters are born, not made, and running comes natural with me.  As long as I take care of myself and eat reasonably, I get along fine. I don't train any during the summer.  That's vacation time and I make it that by spending those weeks fishing.  Laying off like that doesn't bother me.  After all, a dash man doesn't need much wind.  I only take two or three breaths in 100 yards.\"\nA feature story published in 1929 described Bracey as \"almost a recluse,\" a quiet person who rarely left campus, never wears formal clothes, and \"thinks society is all wet.\"\n\nChampionships and records\nIn June 1928, Bracey won both sprint events at the 1928 NCAA Men's Track and Field Championships with times of 9.6 seconds in the 100-yard race and 20.9 seconds in the 220-yard race.  He was the first athlete from Rice to win an NCAA track championship in any event, and it was 1938 before another Rice athlete (Fred Wolcott) accomplished the feat.He qualified for the U.S. Olympic team in 1928 and traveled with the team to the 1928 Summer Olympics in Amsterdam.  He finished fifth in the semifinals of the 100-meter race at the Olympic games with a time of 10.8 seconds. He was the first Rice athlete to compete in the Olympic games; it was 1948 before another Rice athlete competed in the Olympics.At the Texas Relays in March 1929, Bracey tied the world record in the 100-yard sprint with a time of 9.5 seconds.  The next day, he ran the event in 9.4 seconds, but the record was not recognized due to wind conditions.  Football coach Knute Rockne officiated the sprint event in which Bracey's world record was disallowed due to wind conditions.  Rockne told reporters that Bracey was the best sprinter he had seen and added: \"Bracey is a streak.  He is as good as any of them off the marks and runs the last 40 yards faster than any man I ever saw.  He had the wind with him when he did 9.4 at Dallas but on both that occasion and the day before he beat George Simpson of Ohio State by about four yards.  You all know how good Simpson is.\"At the 1929 NCAA Men's Track and Field Championships, Bracey lost his title in the sprint events as Ohio State's George Simpson won both events, and Bracey finished second in the 100-yard race and third in the 220-yard event.Bracey continued to compete through 1932.  He tied the world record in the 100-meter race with a time of 10.4 seconds in June 1932.  In July 1932, he qualified in the preliminaries of the 100-meter and 200-meter events at the Far Western Olympic team trials at Long Beach, California.  However, he was taken to a hospital the following day after an attack of appendicitis and was unable to participate in the finals, which were held while he was in the hospital.\n\nDeath and posthumous honors\nBracey died in Buckeye, Arizona on September 23, 1940, leaving behind wife, Anna Bess Singleton Bracey and daughter, Linda Anne Bracey (Mulpagano) who was 4 months of age at the time of her father's death.In 1970, Bracey was selected as one of the initial inductees into the Rice Athletic Hall of Fame.\nPassage 3:\nJohn G.

He is driven to the train station by Russell Hopton, his best friend, and also a football player for the same college. Jack Whiting, who plays the part of the student manager of the Sanford college athletic association as well as part of the president of the student body, knows that the college needs Williams to win the important game against Colton college.\nWhiting conspires with his girlfriend, played by Marian Nixon, to stop Williams from leaving.

They quickly run to help  her and both of them fall in love with her, without realizing that she really love Whiting. Williams and Hopton soon become suspicious of each other and constantly spy on each other, leaving Nixon to spend her time with Whiting. Just before the big game, Hopton and Williams have an argument and show no interest in the upcoming game. Whiting suggests that Nixon write each of them an identical love note, telling the recipient that she loves him alone.\nWhen Williams and Hopton receive these notes, they end their quarrelling, each thinking that Nixon prefers them to the other.

From the heavy industry in the east where Peters Creek enters the Monongahela River, to the commercial northeast, the suburban northern communities, and the still rural and farming south, the watershed is a veritable patchwork of land use types. There is also a county park, a turnpike, a landfill, and a coal mining legacy to add to the mix. Some communities are relatively stable while others are undergoing rapid development. Peters Creek and its tributaries provide utility to them all in a myriad of ways.\n\nTributaries\nLewis Run, in Jefferson Hills\nBeam's Run, in Jefferson Hills\nLick Run, in South Park Township\nPiney Fork Run, in South Park TownshipPeters Creek also collects numerous unnamed tributaries along its course.\n\nWater quality and recreation\nBecause of past water quality issues, Peters Creek was not considered to have any recreational purpose, but since the 1990s the water quality has improved dramatically. Once plagued with garbage and acid mine drainage, the water quality is now high enough to support its own fish population, which includes trout, bass, catfish, carp, and bluegill.  It is now again possible to enjoy the stream through such activities as fishing, swimming, and during high water, kayaking. There is also a new bike trail that runs along its bank, formerly part of the Montour Railroad.\n\nSee also\nList of rivers of Pennsylvania\nPassage 8:\nCrocodile River (Limpopo)\nThe Crocodile River (Tswana: Oodi, Afrikaans: Krokodilrivier) is a river in South Africa. At its confluence with the Marico River, the Limpopo River is formed.\n\nCourse\nThe Crocodile River has its source in the Witwatersrand mountain range, originating in Constantia Kloof, Roodepoort, Gauteng province. The first dam on the river is the Lake Heritage Dam just west of Lanseria International Airport. Just north of this airport is its confluence  with the Jukskei River. Further downstream into the North West province are the Hartbeespoort Dam and the Roodekoppies Dam. Beyond the Hartbeespoort Dam, the stream passes the town of Brits. The Elands River joins downstream from the Vaalkop Dam, about 20 km further the Pienaars River joins its right bank, shortly after exiting the Klipvoor Dam.\nIn Limpopo province, about 35 km further, the river passes the town of Thabazimbi and meanders for many miles through a sparsely inhabited area before joining the Marico River just west of Rooibokkraal at the limit of North West province to form the start of the Limpopo River.\n\nTributaries\nThe tributaries of the Crocodile River include the Bloubankspruit, Hennops River, Jukskei River, Magalies River, Sterkstroom River, Rosespruit, Skeerpoort River, Kareespruit, Elands River, Bierspruit River and Sundays River.\n\nPollution\nThe Crocodile River is one of the most polluted river systems in South Africa. The effects of pollution from two of South Africa's metropolitan areas, Johannesburg and Tshwane, has been detrimental to the ecology of the system. Untreated industrial, mining, agricultural and household waste has deteriorated the water quality throughout most of its course and led to massive algal blooms in the Hartbeespoort Dam and Roodekoppies Dam. Invasive plant species have negatively affected the integrity of the system.

It is endemic to the eastern United States where it is only known to occur in the Duck River and the Buffalo River, both in Tennessee.\n\nDiscovery and naming\nSteven Layman of Geosyntec Consultants and Rick Mayden of Saint Louis University studied the freshwater darters, most of which are native to Alabama and Tennessee in the United States. While they were studying color variation of Etheostoma stigmaeum, the speckled darter, Layman and Mayden discovered that there were populations with enough variation that they should be described as unique species.This species was one of five distinct species of fish that were named after former U.S. presidents and a vice-president, based on their leadership in conservation.

From the heavy industry in the east where Peters Creek enters the Monongahela River, to the commercial northeast, the suburban northern communities, and the still rural and farming south, the watershed is a veritable patchwork of land use types. There is also a county park, a turnpike, a landfill, and a coal mining legacy to add to the mix. Some communities are relatively stable while others are undergoing rapid development.

Once plagued with garbage and acid mine drainage, the water quality is now high enough to support its own fish population, which includes trout, bass, catfish, carp, and bluegill.  It is now again possible to enjoy the stream through such activities as fishing, swimming, and during high water, kayaking. There is also a new bike trail that runs along its bank, formerly part of the Montour Railroad.\n\nSee also\nList of rivers of Pennsylvania\nPassage 8:\nCrocodile River (Limpopo)\nThe Crocodile River (Tswana: Oodi, Afrikaans: Krokodilrivier) is a river in South Africa. At its confluence with the Marico River, the Limpopo River is formed.\n\nCourse\nThe Crocodile River has its source in the Witwatersrand mountain range, originating in Constantia Kloof, Roodepoort, Gauteng province. The first dam on the river is the Lake Heritage Dam just west of Lanseria International Airport. Just north of this airport is its confluence  with the Jukskei River. Further downstream into the North West province are the Hartbeespoort Dam and the Roodekoppies Dam. Beyond the Hartbeespoort Dam, the stream passes the town of Brits. The Elands River joins downstream from the Vaalkop Dam, about 20 km further the Pienaars River joins its right bank, shortly after exiting the Klipvoor Dam.\nIn Limpopo province, about 35 km further, the river passes the town of Thabazimbi and meanders for many miles through a sparsely inhabited area before joining the Marico River just west of Rooibokkraal at the limit of North West province to form the start of the Limpopo River.\n\nTributaries\nThe tributaries of the Crocodile River include the Bloubankspruit, Hennops River, Jukskei River, Magalies River, Sterkstroom River, Rosespruit, Skeerpoort River, Kareespruit, Elands River, Bierspruit River and Sundays River.\n\nPollution\nThe Crocodile River is one of the most polluted river systems in South Africa. The effects of pollution from two of South Africa's metropolitan areas, Johannesburg and Tshwane, has been detrimental to the ecology of the system. Untreated industrial, mining, agricultural and household waste has deteriorated the water quality throughout most of its course and led to massive algal blooms in the Hartbeespoort Dam and Roodekoppies Dam. Invasive plant species have negatively affected the integrity of the system.

The film stars John Cusack as a writer who adopts a strange young boy (Bobby Coleman) who believes himself to be from Mars. The film was theatrically released on November 2, 2007, by New Line Cinema.\n\nPlot\nDavid Gordon, a popular science fiction author, widowed two years prior as they were trying to adopt a child, is finally matched with a young boy, Dennis. Initially hesitant to adopt alone, he is drawn to him, seeing aspects of himself in him.\nBelieving he is from Mars, Dennis protects himself from the sun's harmful rays, wears weights to counter Earth's weak gravity, eats only Lucky Charms, and hangs upside down to facilitate circulation. He refers often to his mission to study Earth and its people, taking pictures, taking things to catalog, and spending time consulting an ambiguous toy-like device with flashing lights that produces seemingly unintelligible words.\nOnce David decides to adopt Dennis, he spends time getting to know him, patiently coaxing him out of the large cardboard box he hides in. Soon, David is cleared to take Dennis home and meet David's dog, \"Somewhere.\" In Dennis's bedroom is a projector of the solar system that he pronounces inaccurate. With the help of his friend Harlee and sister Liz, David tries to help Dennis overcome his delusion by both indulging it and encouraging him to act like everyone else. Dennis attends school but is quickly expelled for repeatedly 'stealing' items for his collection. Frustrated, David tells Liz that perhaps Dennis is from Mars.\nMeanwhile, David's literary agent, Jeff, pushes him to finish writing his commissioned sequel, which is due soon. He struggles to make time for writing, regularly pulled away from it to deal with Dennis. While sitting down to write, the flash from Dennis's Polaroid camera catches him off-guard and he accidentally breaks some glass. David picks Dennis up and carries him across the room. Upset by David's abrupt action, the boy fears he is going to be sent away. David explains that he was just worried he'd get cut by the glass and that he loves him more than his material possessions. Assuring him that he will never send him away, he encourages Dennis to break more things. They move to the kitchen and break dishes and then spray ketchup and dish detergent at each other. Lefkowitz, from Social Services, appears in the window and sees the mayhem. He rebukes David, setting up a case review.\nDavid encourages Dennis to be from Mars only at home; though he must be from Earth everywhere else. Passing his interview by saying he was pretending, he stays with David. Now his adoptive father, he insists Dennis acknowledge being from Earth, making him hurt and angry. David leaves him with Liz to attend the reveal of his new book, supposedly a sequel. He confesses to Tina, the publisher, that rather than being a sequel, it is a new book titled Martian Child, about Dennis. In her fury, Tina makes a scene, but takes the manuscript as David leaves to be with Dennis.\nMeanwhile, Dennis has left the house with his suitcase of earthly artifacts. When David arrives home, he finds the police and learns the boy is gone, he remembers the place he'd said he was found. David asks Harlee to drive him to the location, where they spot Dennis high up on the outside ledge of the museum's domed roof. David climbs up to him as the police and Liz arrive. Dennis points out a bright searchlight in a nearby cloud as someone coming to take him home, but David assures him it's just a helicopter. David professes his love for Dennis and asserts he will never ever leave him. Eventually Dennis trusts David and they hug.\nDavid's voiceover tells about the parallel of children who come into our world, struggling to understand it, being like little aliens. As Tina reads the manuscript aboard an airplane, she begins to cry.\n\nCast\nIn addition, Anjelica Huston plays Tina, David's publisher.\n\nProduction\nDespite persistent misperceptions, this film is not based on David Gerrold's 2002 semi-autobiographical novel The Martian Child, (although it shares some of the same incidents) but rather is based on his 1994 fictional Hugo and Nebula Award-winning novella of the same name, which has caused much confusion about the source material, especially for Gerrold's fans in segments of the gay community.  The short story does not specify the protagonist's sexual orientation.  Only when, years later, Gerrold rewrote and expanded his story to novella length did he choose to include his sexuality. While Gerrold had, in real life, adopted a son as an openly gay man, in the film the protagonist is straight and has a female love interest. Because of the confusion surrounding the different publication dates of the original short story and the latter novella, some members of the gay community have criticized the lead role in the film being portrayed as straight, even though the main character in the short story was never identified as gay. Gerrold has expressed disappointment that the producers forced the protagonist to be changed from a gay man to a straight widower but felt it was a worthwhile trade-off to get published a story about a child in a group home needing a parent.The film began shooting in Vancouver on May 2, 2005, and completed filming in July 2005, with the studio repeatedly pushing back the release date. Jerry Zucker was hired to direct uncredited reshoots shortly before the film's release.\n\nRelease\nBox office\nMartian Child opened in 2,020 venues on November 2, 2007 and earned $3,376,669 in its first weekend, ranking seventh in the domestic box office and third among the weekend's new releases. The film closed six weeks later on December 13, having grossed $7,500,310 domestically and $1,851,434 overseas, totaling $9,351,744 worldwide.\n\nCritical reception\nThe film received mixed reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 33% score, based on 106 reviews, with an average rating of 5/10. The site's consensus states: \"Despite some charms, overt emotional manipulation and an inconsistent tone prevents Martian Child from being the heartfelt dramedy it aspires to be.\" Metacritic reports a 48 out of 100 rating, based on 26 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".\n\nHome media\nMartian Child was released on DVD on February 12, 2008. It opened at #20 the DVD sales chart, selling 69,000 units for revenue of $1.3 million. As per the latest figures, 400,000 DVD units have been sold, acquiring revenue of $7,613,945. This does not include DVD rentals/Blu-ray sales.  The film is available on Netflix streaming.\n\nAwards\nPassage 4:\nBrian Kennedy (gallery director)\nBrian Patrick Kennedy (born 5 November 1961) is an Irish-born art museum director who has worked in Ireland and Australia, and now lives and works in the United States.  He was the director of the Peabody Essex Museum in Salem for 17 months, resigning December 31, 2020. He was the director of the Toledo Museum of Art in Ohio from 2010 to 2019. He was the director of the Hood Museum of Art from 2005 to 2010, and the National Gallery of Australia (Canberra) from 1997 to 2004.\n\nCareer\nBrian Kennedy currently lives and works in the United States after leaving Australia in 2005 to direct the Hood Museum of Art at Dartmouth College. In October 2010 he became the ninth Director of the Toledo Museum of Art. On 1 July 2019, he succeeded Dan Monroe as the executive director and CEO of the Peabody Essex Museum.\n\nEarly life and career in Ireland\nKennedy was born in Dublin and attended Clonkeen College. He received B.A. (1982), M.A. (1985) and PhD (1989) degrees from University College-Dublin, where he studied both art history and history.\nHe worked in the Irish Department of Education (1982), the European Commission, Brussels (1983), and in Ireland at the Chester Beatty Library (1983\u201385), Government Publications Office (1985\u201386), and Department of Finance (1986\u201389). He married Mary Fiona Carlin in 1988.He was Assistant Director at the National Gallery of Ireland in Dublin from 1989 to 1997. He was Chair of the Irish Association of Art Historians from 1996 to 1997, and of the Council of Australian Art Museum Directors from 2001 to 2003. In September 1997 he became Director of the National Gallery of Australia.\n\nNational Gallery of Australia (NGA)\nKennedy expanded the traveling exhibitions and loans program throughout Australia, arranged for several major shows of Australian art abroad, increased the number of exhibitions at the museum itself and oversaw the development of an extensive multi-media site.  Although he oversaw several years of the museum's highest ever annual visitation, he discontinued the emphasis of his predecessor, Betty Churcher, on showing \"blockbuster\" exhibitions.\nDuring his directorship, the NGA gained government support for improving the building and significant private donations and corporate sponsorship. However, the initial design for the building proved controversial generating a public dispute with the original architect on moral rights grounds.  As a result, the project was not delivered during Dr Kennedy's tenure, with a significantly altered design completed some years later.  Private funding supported two acquisitions of British art, including David Hockney's A Bigger Grand Canyon in 1999, and Lucian Freud's After C\u00e9zanne in 2001. Kennedy built on the established collections at the museum by acquiring the Holmgren-Spertus collection of Indonesian textiles; the Kenneth Tyler collection of editioned prints, screens, multiples and unique proofs; and the Australian Print Workshop Archive. He was also notable for campaigning for the construction of a new \"front\" entrance to the Gallery, facing King Edward Terrace, which was completed in 2010 (see reference to the building project above).\nKennedy's cancellation of the \"Sensation exhibition\" (scheduled at the NGA from 2 June 2000 to 13 August 2000) was controversial, and seen by some as censorship. He claimed that the decision was due to the exhibition being \"too close to the market\" implying that a national cultural institution cannot exhibit the private collection of a speculative art investor. However, there were other exhibitions at the NGA during his tenure, which could have raised similar concerns. The exhibition featured the privately owned Young British Artists works belonging to Charles Saatchi and attracted large attendances in London and Brooklyn. Its most controversial work was Chris Ofili's The Holy Virgin Mary, a painting which used elephant dung and was accused of being blasphemous. The then-mayor of New York, Rudolph Giuliani, campaigned against the exhibition, claiming it was \"Catholic-bashing\" and an \"aggressive, vicious, disgusting attack on religion.\" In November 1999, Kennedy cancelled the exhibition and stated that the events in New York had \"obscured discussion of the artistic merit of the works of art\". He has said that it \"was the toughest decision of my professional life, so far.\"Kennedy was also repeatedly questioned on his management of a range of issues during the Australian Government's Senate Estimates process - particularly on the NGA's occupational health and safety record and concerns about the NGA's twenty-year-old air-conditioning system. The air-conditioning was finally renovated in 2003. Kennedy announced in 2002 that he would not seek extension of his contract beyond 2004, accepting a seven-year term as had his two predecessors.He became a joint Irish-Australian citizen in 2003.\n\nToledo Museum of Art\nThe Toledo Museum of Art is known for its exceptional collections of European and American paintings and sculpture, glass, antiquities, artist books, Japanese prints and netsuke. The museum offers free admission and is recognized for its historical leadership in the field of art education.  During his tenure, Kennedy has focused the museum's art education efforts on visual literacy, which he defines as \"learning to read, understand and write visual language.\"   Initiatives have included baby and toddler tours, specialized training for all staff, docents, volunteers and the launch of a website, www.vislit.org. In November 2014, the museum hosted the International Visual Literacy Association (IVLA) conference, the first Museum to do so. Kennedy has been a frequent speaker on the topic, including 2010 and 2013 TEDx talks on visual and sensory literacy.\nKennedy has expressed an interest in expanding the museum's collection of contemporary art and art by indigenous peoples. Works by Frank Stella, Sean Scully, Jaume Plensa, Ravinder Reddy and Mary Sibande have been acquired.  In addition, the museum has made major acquisitions of Old Master paintings by Frans Hals and Luca Giordano.During his tenure the Toledo Museum of Art has announced the return of several objects from its collection due to claims the objects were stolen and/or illegally exported prior being sold to the museum.  In 2011 a Meissen sweetmeat stand was returned to Germany followed by an Etruscan Kalpis or water jug to Italy (2013), an Indian sculpture of Ganesha (2014) and an astrological compendium to Germany in 2015.\n\nHood Museum of Art\nKennedy became Director of the Hood Museum of Art in July 2005. During his tenure, he implemented a series of large and small-scale exhibitions and oversaw the production of more than 20 publications to bring greater public attention to the museum's remarkable collections of the arts of America, Europe, Africa, Papua New Guinea and the Polar regions. At 70,000 objects, the Hood has one of the largest collections on any American college of university campus. The exhibition, Black Womanhood: Images, Icons, and Ideologies of the African Body, toured several US venues. Kennedy increased campus curricular use of works of art, with thousands of objects pulled from storage for classes annually. Numerous acquisitions were made with the museum's generous endowments, and he curated several exhibitions: including Wenda Gu: Forest of Stone Steles: Retranslation and Rewriting Tang Dynasty Poetry, Sean Scully: The Art of the Stripe, and Frank Stella: Irregular Polygons.\n\nPublications\nKennedy has written or edited a number of books on art, including:\n\nAlfred Chester Beatty and Ireland 1950-1968: A study in cultural politics, Glendale Press (1988), ISBN 978-0-907606-49-9\nDreams and responsibilities: The state and arts in independent Ireland, Arts Council of Ireland (1990), ISBN 978-0-906627-32-7\nJack B Yeats: Jack Butler Yeats, 1871-1957 (Lives of Irish Artists), Unipub (October 1991), ISBN 978-0-948524-24-0\nThe Anatomy Lesson: Art and Medicine (with Davis Coakley), National Gallery of Ireland (January 1992), ISBN 978-0-903162-65-4\nIreland: Art into History (with Raymond Gillespie), Roberts Rinehart Publishers (1994), ISBN 978-1-57098-005-3\nIrish Painting, Roberts Rinehart Publishers (November 1997),  ISBN 978-1-86059-059-7\nSean Scully: The Art of the Stripe, Hood Museum of Art (October 2008), ISBN 978-0-944722-34-3\nFrank Stella: Irregular Polygons, 1965-1966, Hood Museum of Art (October 2010), ISBN 978-0-944722-39-8\n\nHonors and achievements\nKennedy was awarded the Australian Centenary Medal in 2001 for service to Australian Society and its art. He is a trustee and treasurer of the Association of Art Museum Directors, a peer reviewer for the American Association of Museums and a member of the International Association of Art Critics. In 2013 he was appointed inaugural eminent professor at the University of Toledo and received an honorary doctorate from Lourdes University. Most recently, Kennedy received the 2014 Northwest Region, Ohio Art Education Association award for distinguished educator for art education.\n\n\n== Notes ==\nPassage 5:\nIan Barry (director)\nIan Barry is an Australian director of film and TV.\n\nSelect credits\nWaiting for Lucas (1973) (short)\nStone (1974) (editor only)\nThe Chain Reaction (1980)\nWhose Baby?

The film stars John Cusack as a writer who adopts a strange young boy (Bobby Coleman) who believes himself to be from Mars. The film was theatrically released on November 2, 2007, by New Line Cinema.\n\nPlot\nDavid Gordon, a popular science fiction author, widowed two years prior as they were trying to adopt a child, is finally matched with a young boy, Dennis. Initially hesitant to adopt alone, he is drawn to him, seeing aspects of himself in him.\nBelieving he is from Mars, Dennis protects himself from the sun's harmful rays, wears weights to counter Earth's weak gravity, eats only Lucky Charms, and hangs upside down to facilitate circulation. He refers often to his mission to study Earth and its people, taking pictures, taking things to catalog, and spending time consulting an ambiguous toy-like device with flashing lights that produces seemingly unintelligible words.\nOnce David decides to adopt Dennis, he spends time getting to know him, patiently coaxing him out of the large cardboard box he hides in. Soon, David is cleared to take Dennis home and meet David's dog, \"Somewhere.\" In Dennis's bedroom is a projector of the solar system that he pronounces inaccurate. With the help of his friend Harlee and sister Liz, David tries to help Dennis overcome his delusion by both indulging it and encouraging him to act like everyone else. Dennis attends school but is quickly expelled for repeatedly 'stealing' items for his collection. Frustrated, David tells Liz that perhaps Dennis is from Mars.\nMeanwhile, David's literary agent, Jeff, pushes him to finish writing his commissioned sequel, which is due soon. He struggles to make time for writing, regularly pulled away from it to deal with Dennis. While sitting down to write, the flash from Dennis's Polaroid camera catches him off-guard and he accidentally breaks some glass. David picks Dennis up and carries him across the room. Upset by David's abrupt action, the boy fears he is going to be sent away. David explains that he was just worried he'd get cut by the glass and that he loves him more than his material possessions. Assuring him that he will never send him away, he encourages Dennis to break more things. They move to the kitchen and break dishes and then spray ketchup and dish detergent at each other. Lefkowitz, from Social Services, appears in the window and sees the mayhem. He rebukes David, setting up a case review.\nDavid encourages Dennis to be from Mars only at home; though he must be from Earth everywhere else. Passing his interview by saying he was pretending, he stays with David. Now his adoptive father, he insists Dennis acknowledge being from Earth, making him hurt and angry. David leaves him with Liz to attend the reveal of his new book, supposedly a sequel. He confesses to Tina, the publisher, that rather than being a sequel, it is a new book titled Martian Child, about Dennis. In her fury, Tina makes a scene, but takes the manuscript as David leaves to be with Dennis.\nMeanwhile, Dennis has left the house with his suitcase of earthly artifacts. When David arrives home, he finds the police and learns the boy is gone, he remembers the place he'd said he was found. David asks Harlee to drive him to the location, where they spot Dennis high up on the outside ledge of the museum's domed roof. David climbs up to him as the police and Liz arrive. Dennis points out a bright searchlight in a nearby cloud as someone coming to take him home, but David assures him it's just a helicopter. David professes his love for Dennis and asserts he will never ever leave him. Eventually Dennis trusts David and they hug.\nDavid's voiceover tells about the parallel of children who come into our world, struggling to understand it, being like little aliens. As Tina reads the manuscript aboard an airplane, she begins to cry.\n\nCast\nIn addition, Anjelica Huston plays Tina, David's publisher.\n\nProduction\nDespite persistent misperceptions, this film is not based on David Gerrold's 2002 semi-autobiographical novel The Martian Child, (although it shares some of the same incidents) but rather is based on his 1994 fictional Hugo and Nebula Award-winning novella of the same name, which has caused much confusion about the source material, especially for Gerrold's fans in segments of the gay community.  The short story does not specify the protagonist's sexual orientation.  Only when, years later, Gerrold rewrote and expanded his story to novella length did he choose to include his sexuality. While Gerrold had, in real life, adopted a son as an openly gay man, in the film the protagonist is straight and has a female love interest. Because of the confusion surrounding the different publication dates of the original short story and the latter novella, some members of the gay community have criticized the lead role in the film being portrayed as straight, even though the main character in the short story was never identified as gay. Gerrold has expressed disappointment that the producers forced the protagonist to be changed from a gay man to a straight widower but felt it was a worthwhile trade-off to get published a story about a child in a group home needing a parent.The film began shooting in Vancouver on May 2, 2005, and completed filming in July 2005, with the studio repeatedly pushing back the release date. Jerry Zucker was hired to direct uncredited reshoots shortly before the film's release.\n\nRelease\nBox office\nMartian Child opened in 2,020 venues on November 2, 2007 and earned $3,376,669 in its first weekend, ranking seventh in the domestic box office and third among the weekend's new releases. The film closed six weeks later on December 13, having grossed $7,500,310 domestically and $1,851,434 overseas, totaling $9,351,744 worldwide.\n\nCritical reception\nThe film received mixed reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 33% score, based on 106 reviews, with an average rating of 5/10. The site's consensus states: \"Despite some charms, overt emotional manipulation and an inconsistent tone prevents Martian Child from being the heartfelt dramedy it aspires to be.\" Metacritic reports a 48 out of 100 rating, based on 26 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".\n\nHome media\nMartian Child was released on DVD on February 12, 2008. It opened at #20 the DVD sales chart, selling 69,000 units for revenue of $1.3 million. As per the latest figures, 400,000 DVD units have been sold, acquiring revenue of $7,613,945. This does not include DVD rentals/Blu-ray sales.  The film is available on Netflix streaming.\n\nAwards\nPassage 4:\nBrian Kennedy (gallery director)\nBrian Patrick Kennedy (born 5 November 1961) is an Irish-born art museum director who has worked in Ireland and Australia, and now lives and works in the United States.  He was the director of the Peabody Essex Museum in Salem for 17 months, resigning December 31, 2020. He was the director of the Toledo Museum of Art in Ohio from 2010 to 2019. He was the director of the Hood Museum of Art from 2005 to 2010, and the National Gallery of Australia (Canberra) from 1997 to 2004.\n\nCareer\nBrian Kennedy currently lives and works in the United States after leaving Australia in 2005 to direct the Hood Museum of Art at Dartmouth College. In October 2010 he became the ninth Director of the Toledo Museum of Art. On 1 July 2019, he succeeded Dan Monroe as the executive director and CEO of the Peabody Essex Museum.\n\nEarly life and career in Ireland\nKennedy was born in Dublin and attended Clonkeen College. He received B.A. (1982), M.A. (1985) and PhD (1989) degrees from University College-Dublin, where he studied both art history and history.\nHe worked in the Irish Department of Education (1982), the European Commission, Brussels (1983), and in Ireland at the Chester Beatty Library (1983\u201385), Government Publications Office (1985\u201386), and Department of Finance (1986\u201389). He married Mary Fiona Carlin in 1988.He was Assistant Director at the National Gallery of Ireland in Dublin from 1989 to 1997. He was Chair of the Irish Association of Art Historians from 1996 to 1997, and of the Council of Australian Art Museum Directors from 2001 to 2003. In September 1997 he became Director of the National Gallery of Australia.\n\nNational Gallery of Australia (NGA)\nKennedy expanded the traveling exhibitions and loans program throughout Australia, arranged for several major shows of Australian art abroad, increased the number of exhibitions at the museum itself and oversaw the development of an extensive multi-media site.  Although he oversaw several years of the museum's highest ever annual visitation, he discontinued the emphasis of his predecessor, Betty Churcher, on showing \"blockbuster\" exhibitions.\nDuring his directorship, the NGA gained government support for improving the building and significant private donations and corporate sponsorship. However, the initial design for the building proved controversial generating a public dispute with the original architect on moral rights grounds.  As a result, the project was not delivered during Dr Kennedy's tenure, with a significantly altered design completed some years later.  Private funding supported two acquisitions of British art, including David Hockney's A Bigger Grand Canyon in 1999, and Lucian Freud's After C\u00e9zanne in 2001. Kennedy built on the established collections at the museum by acquiring the Holmgren-Spertus collection of Indonesian textiles; the Kenneth Tyler collection of editioned prints, screens, multiples and unique proofs; and the Australian Print Workshop Archive. He was also notable for campaigning for the construction of a new \"front\" entrance to the Gallery, facing King Edward Terrace, which was completed in 2010 (see reference to the building project above).\nKennedy's cancellation of the \"Sensation exhibition\" (scheduled at the NGA from 2 June 2000 to 13 August 2000) was controversial, and seen by some as censorship. He claimed that the decision was due to the exhibition being \"too close to the market\" implying that a national cultural institution cannot exhibit the private collection of a speculative art investor. However, there were other exhibitions at the NGA during his tenure, which could have raised similar concerns. The exhibition featured the privately owned Young British Artists works belonging to Charles Saatchi and attracted large attendances in London and Brooklyn. Its most controversial work was Chris Ofili's The Holy Virgin Mary, a painting which used elephant dung and was accused of being blasphemous. The then-mayor of New York, Rudolph Giuliani, campaigned against the exhibition, claiming it was \"Catholic-bashing\" and an \"aggressive, vicious, disgusting attack on religion.\" In November 1999, Kennedy cancelled the exhibition and stated that the events in New York had \"obscured discussion of the artistic merit of the works of art\". He has said that it \"was the toughest decision of my professional life, so far.\"Kennedy was also repeatedly questioned on his management of a range of issues during the Australian Government's Senate Estimates process - particularly on the NGA's occupational health and safety record and concerns about the NGA's twenty-year-old air-conditioning system. The air-conditioning was finally renovated in 2003. Kennedy announced in 2002 that he would not seek extension of his contract beyond 2004, accepting a seven-year term as had his two predecessors.He became a joint Irish-Australian citizen in 2003.\n\nToledo Museum of Art\nThe Toledo Museum of Art is known for its exceptional collections of European and American paintings and sculpture, glass, antiquities, artist books, Japanese prints and netsuke. The museum offers free admission and is recognized for its historical leadership in the field of art education.  During his tenure, Kennedy has focused the museum's art education efforts on visual literacy, which he defines as \"learning to read, understand and write visual language.\"   Initiatives have included baby and toddler tours, specialized training for all staff, docents, volunteers and the launch of a website, www.vislit.org. In November 2014, the museum hosted the International Visual Literacy Association (IVLA) conference, the first Museum to do so. Kennedy has been a frequent speaker on the topic, including 2010 and 2013 TEDx talks on visual and sensory literacy.\nKennedy has expressed an interest in expanding the museum's collection of contemporary art and art by indigenous peoples. Works by Frank Stella, Sean Scully, Jaume Plensa, Ravinder Reddy and Mary Sibande have been acquired.  In addition, the museum has made major acquisitions of Old Master paintings by Frans Hals and Luca Giordano.During his tenure the Toledo Museum of Art has announced the return of several objects from its collection due to claims the objects were stolen and/or illegally exported prior being sold to the museum.  In 2011 a Meissen sweetmeat stand was returned to Germany followed by an Etruscan Kalpis or water jug to Italy (2013), an Indian sculpture of Ganesha (2014) and an astrological compendium to Germany in 2015.\n\nHood Museum of Art\nKennedy became Director of the Hood Museum of Art in July 2005. During his tenure, he implemented a series of large and small-scale exhibitions and oversaw the production of more than 20 publications to bring greater public attention to the museum's remarkable collections of the arts of America, Europe, Africa, Papua New Guinea and the Polar regions. At 70,000 objects, the Hood has one of the largest collections on any American college of university campus. The exhibition, Black Womanhood: Images, Icons, and Ideologies of the African Body, toured several US venues. Kennedy increased campus curricular use of works of art, with thousands of objects pulled from storage for classes annually. Numerous acquisitions were made with the museum's generous endowments, and he curated several exhibitions: including Wenda Gu: Forest of Stone Steles: Retranslation and Rewriting Tang Dynasty Poetry, Sean Scully: The Art of the Stripe, and Frank Stella: Irregular Polygons.\n\nPublications\nKennedy has written or edited a number of books on art, including:\n\nAlfred Chester Beatty and Ireland 1950-1968: A study in cultural politics, Glendale Press (1988), ISBN 978-0-907606-49-9\nDreams and responsibilities: The state and arts in independent Ireland, Arts Council of Ireland (1990), ISBN 978-0-906627-32-7\nJack B Yeats: Jack Butler Yeats, 1871-1957 (Lives of Irish Artists), Unipub (October 1991), ISBN 978-0-948524-24-0\nThe Anatomy Lesson: Art and Medicine (with Davis Coakley), National Gallery of Ireland (January 1992), ISBN 978-0-903162-65-4\nIreland: Art into History (with Raymond Gillespie), Roberts Rinehart Publishers (1994), ISBN 978-1-57098-005-3\nIrish Painting, Roberts Rinehart Publishers (November 1997),  ISBN 978-1-86059-059-7\nSean Scully: The Art of the Stripe, Hood Museum of Art (October 2008), ISBN 978-0-944722-34-3\nFrank Stella: Irregular Polygons, 1965-1966, Hood Museum of Art (October 2010), ISBN 978-0-944722-39-8\n\nHonors and achievements\nKennedy was awarded the Australian Centenary Medal in 2001 for service to Australian Society and its art. He is a trustee and treasurer of the Association of Art Museum Directors, a peer reviewer for the American Association of Museums and a member of the International Association of Art Critics. In 2013 he was appointed inaugural eminent professor at the University of Toledo and received an honorary doctorate from Lourdes University. Most recently, Kennedy received the 2014 Northwest Region, Ohio Art Education Association award for distinguished educator for art education.\n\n\n== Notes ==\nPassage 5:\nIan Barry (director)\nIan Barry is an Australian director of film and TV.\n\nSelect credits\nWaiting for Lucas (1973) (short)\nStone (1974) (editor only)\nThe Chain Reaction (1980)\nWhose Baby?

The Apaches kill the lot of them and take their communal woman Riva. The Apaches' initial intention was to sell Riva north of the border to the Americans. On two occasions, Mangas refuses to sell Riva to his good friend Luke Fargo (Ben Johnson), despite being offered excellent deals for her.\nLuke brings a government representative to meet with Mangas, trying to come to terms with the Apaches. The most Mangas will promise is the Apache will not break the peace with the whites first.\nMangas desires Riva for his wife, an honor never before extended to a Mexican woman. He has to fight three braves who disagree with him, killing all three. He then tells the band that Riva will not be a squaw, but will be trained as a warrior, again breaking with custom. Following Mangas's second refusal to sell him Riva, whom Luke also wants for a wife, Luke reluctantly attends their wedding.\nMeanwhile a group of American gold seekers enter the Apache lands. After making a gold strike in a stream, they attack the Indians camped on the bank. When Mangas comes to bring the offending miners to the law, they pinion and whip him. This sets off an Apache war, with Mangas Coloradas becoming known as \"Red Sleeves.\"\nLuke attempts to put a stop to the war by bringing a representative from Washington to meet with Mangas. The attempt fails when the men with him, thinking they are about to be ambushed by the Apaches, fire on them. In the ensuing firefight, Luke is shot by an arrow. Taken to Mangas's camp, Riva removes the arrow and nurses Luke back to health. He is sent back with a message from Mangas to the government.\nWhen the Civil War breaks out, Luke volunteers for the Union and is commissioned a major in the cavalry. He is assigned to the frontier, to deal with the Apache problem. Meanwhile, Mangas is wounded on a raid, taking a bullet that shatters his breastbone. Riva takes him to a town with a doctor. Mangas promises the doctor that if he can patch him up and he lives, the town will be safe from the Apaches. But if he dies, the tribe will kill everyone in the town and burn it to the ground.\nWhile he is being worked on by the doctor, Luke and a troop of cavalry arrive. He goes forward to the defenses set up by the Apache under a flag of truce, and recognized by braves who know him and his friendship with Mangas, is passed inside. The friends meet and talk, and Luke leads Mangas, Riva, and their warriors out of the town. Luke advises Mangas to take his people deep into the mountains where it will be a long time (if ever) before the cavalry can come after them. Wishing each other well, Mangas and Riva take their leave of Luke and lead their people away from the town.\n\nCast\nLex Barker as Mangas Coloradas\nJoan Taylor as Riva\nBen Johnson as Luke Fargo\nLarry Chance as Ponce\nRichard H.

Cutting and John Pickard.  The film was produced by Aubrey Schenck and Howard W. Koch for United Artists and it was released on March 21, 1957.\n\nPlot\nPrior to the American Civil War, a group of Apache led by their chief Mangas Coloradas track some of their stolen horses to a group of Mexicans. The Apaches kill the lot of them and take their communal woman Riva. The Apaches' initial intention was to sell Riva north of the border to the Americans. On two occasions, Mangas refuses to sell Riva to his good friend Luke Fargo (Ben Johnson), despite being offered excellent deals for her.\nLuke brings a government representative to meet with Mangas, trying to come to terms with the Apaches. The most Mangas will promise is the Apache will not break the peace with the whites first.\nMangas desires Riva for his wife, an honor never before extended to a Mexican woman. He has to fight three braves who disagree with him, killing all three. He then tells the band that Riva will not be a squaw, but will be trained as a warrior, again breaking with custom. Following Mangas's second refusal to sell him Riva, whom Luke also wants for a wife, Luke reluctantly attends their wedding.\nMeanwhile a group of American gold seekers enter the Apache lands. After making a gold strike in a stream, they attack the Indians camped on the bank. When Mangas comes to bring the offending miners to the law, they pinion and whip him. This sets off an Apache war, with Mangas Coloradas becoming known as \"Red Sleeves.\"\nLuke attempts to put a stop to the war by bringing a representative from Washington to meet with Mangas. The attempt fails when the men with him, thinking they are about to be ambushed by the Apaches, fire on them. In the ensuing firefight, Luke is shot by an arrow. Taken to Mangas's camp, Riva removes the arrow and nurses Luke back to health. He is sent back with a message from Mangas to the government.\nWhen the Civil War breaks out, Luke volunteers for the Union and is commissioned a major in the cavalry. He is assigned to the frontier, to deal with the Apache problem. Meanwhile, Mangas is wounded on a raid, taking a bullet that shatters his breastbone. Riva takes him to a town with a doctor. Mangas promises the doctor that if he can patch him up and he lives, the town will be safe from the Apaches. But if he dies, the tribe will kill everyone in the town and burn it to the ground.\nWhile he is being worked on by the doctor, Luke and a troop of cavalry arrive. He goes forward to the defenses set up by the Apache under a flag of truce, and recognized by braves who know him and his friendship with Mangas, is passed inside. The friends meet and talk, and Luke leads Mangas, Riva, and their warriors out of the town. Luke advises Mangas to take his people deep into the mountains where it will be a long time (if ever) before the cavalry can come after them. Wishing each other well, Mangas and Riva take their leave of Luke and lead their people away from the town.\n\nCast\nLex Barker as Mangas Coloradas\nJoan Taylor as Riva\nBen Johnson as Luke Fargo\nLarry Chance as Ponce\nRichard H.

Augustus Barratt (3 June 1873 \u2013 12 April 1947) was a Scottish-born, later American, songwriter and musician.\n\nEarly life and songs\nWalter Augustus Barratt was born 3 June 1873 in Kilmarnock, the son of composer John Barratt; the family later lived in Paisley. In 1893 he won a scholarship for composition to the Royal College of Music.\nIn his early twenties he contributed to The Scottish Students' Song Book, with three of his own song compositions and numerous arrangements.\nBy the end of 1897 he had published dozens of songs, such as Sir Patrick Spens, The Death of Cuthullin, an album of his own compositions, and arrangements of ten songs by Samuel Lover.\nHe then, living in London, turned his attention to staged musical comedy, co-creating, with Adrian Ross, The Tree Dumas Skiteers, a skit, based on Sydney Grundy's The Musketeers that starred Herbert Beerbohm Tree. He co-composed with Howard Talbot the successful Kitty Grey (1900).He continued to write songs and to receive recognition for them. The 1901 and 1902 BBC Promenade Concerts, \"The Proms\", included four of his compositions, namely Come back, sweet Love, The Mermaid, My Peggy and Private Donald.\nHis setting of My Ships, a poem by Ella Wheeler Wilcox, was performed by Clara Butt and republished several times. It also appeared four times, with different singers, in the 1913 and 1914 Proms.\n\nAmerica\nIn September 1904 he went to live in New York City, finding employment with shows on Broadway, including the following roles:\n\non-stage actor (Sir Benjamin Backbite) in Lady Teazle (1904-1905), a musical version of The School for Scandal;\nmusical director of The Little Michus (1907), also featuring songs by Barratt;\nco-composer of Miss Pocahontas (1907), a musical comedy;\nmusical director of The Love Cure (1909\u20131910), a musical romance;\ncomposer of The Girl and the Drummer (1910), a musical romance with book by George Broadhurst. Tried out in Chicago and elsewhere, it did not do well and never reached Broadway;\nmusical director of The Quaker Girl (1911\u20131912);\nco-composer and musical director of My Best Girl (1912);\nmusical director of The Sunshine Girl (1913);\nmusical director of The Girl who Smiles (1915), a musical comedy;\nmusical director and contributor to music and lyrics of Her Soldier Boy (1916\u20131917);\ncomposer, lyricist and musical director of Fancy Free (1918), with book by Dorothy Donnelly and Edgar Smith;\ncontributor of a song to The Passing Show of 1918;\ncomposer and musical director of Little Simplicity (1918), with book and lyrics by Rida Johnson Young;\ncontributor of lyrics to The Melting of Molly (1918\u20131919), a musical comedy;\nmusical director of What's in a Name? (1920), a musical revue\n\n1921 in London\nThough domiciled in the US, he made several visits back to England. During an extended stay in 1921 he played a major part in the creation of two shows, both produced by Charles B. Cochran, namely\n\nLeague of Notions, at the New Oxford Theatre, for which he composed the music and co-wrote, with John Murray Anderson, the lyrics;\nFun of the Fayre, at the London Pavilion, for which similarly he wrote the music and co-wrote the lyrics\n\nBack to Broadway\nBack in the US he returned to Broadway, working as\ncomposer and lyricist of Jack and Jill (1923), a musical comedy;\nmusical director of The Silver Swan (1929), a musical romance\n\nRadio plays\nIn later years he wrote plays and operettas mostly for radio, such as:\n\nSnapshots: a radioperetta (1929)\nSushannah and the Brush Wielders: a play in 1 act (1929)\nThe Magic Voice: a radio series (1933)\nMen of Action: a series of radio sketches (1933)\nSay, Uncle: a radio series (1933)\nSealed Orders: a radio drama (1934)\nSergeant Gabriel (with Hugh Abercrombie) (1945)\n\nPersonal\nIn 1897 in London he married Lizzie May Stoner. They had one son. In 1904 he emigrated to the US and lived in New York City. His first marriage ended in divorce in 1915 and, in 1918, he married Ethel J Moore, who was American. In 1924, he became a naturalized American citizen. He died on 12 April 1947 in New York City.\n\nNote on his first name\nThe book British Musical Biography by Brown & Stratton (1897) in its entry for John Barratt refers to \"his son William Augustus Barratt\" with details that make it clear that Walter Augustus Barratt is the same person and that a \"William\" Augustus Barratt is a mistake. For professional purposes up to about 1900 he appears to have written as \"W. Augustus Barratt\", and thereafter mostly as simply \"Augustus Barratt\".", "answers": ["War Drums"], "length": 3543, "dataset": "2wikimqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "16b98a59e06d1c72b4da73f79e5c99f936e8c2fdbee29a0b", "pred": " War Drums."}

He was the director of the Peabody Essex Museum in Salem for 17 months, resigning December 31, 2020. He was the director of the Toledo Museum of Art in Ohio from 2010 to 2019. He was the director of the Hood Museum of Art from 2005 to 2010, and the National Gallery of Australia (Canberra) from 1997 to 2004.\n\nCareer\nBrian Kennedy currently lives and works in the United States after leaving Australia in 2005 to direct the Hood Museum of Art at Dartmouth College. In October 2010 he became the ninth Director of the Toledo Museum of Art. On 1 July 2019, he succeeded Dan Monroe as the executive director and CEO of the Peabody Essex Museum.\n\nEarly life and career in Ireland\nKennedy was born in Dublin and attended Clonkeen College. He received B.A. (1982), M.A. (1985) and PhD (1989) degrees from University College-Dublin, where he studied both art history and history.\nHe worked in the Irish Department of Education (1982), the European Commission, Brussels (1983), and in Ireland at the Chester Beatty Library (1983\u201385), Government Publications Office (1985\u201386), and Department of Finance (1986\u201389). He married Mary Fiona Carlin in 1988.He was Assistant Director at the National Gallery of Ireland in Dublin from 1989 to 1997. He was Chair of the Irish Association of Art Historians from 1996 to 1997, and of the Council of Australian Art Museum Directors from 2001 to 2003. In September 1997 he became Director of the National Gallery of Australia.\n\nNational Gallery of Australia (NGA)\nKennedy expanded the traveling exhibitions and loans program throughout Australia, arranged for several major shows of Australian art abroad, increased the number of exhibitions at the museum itself and oversaw the development of an extensive multi-media site.  Although he oversaw several years of the museum's highest ever annual visitation, he discontinued the emphasis of his predecessor, Betty Churcher, on showing \"blockbuster\" exhibitions.\nDuring his directorship, the NGA gained government support for improving the building and significant private donations and corporate sponsorship. However, the initial design for the building proved controversial generating a public dispute with the original architect on moral rights grounds.  As a result, the project was not delivered during Dr Kennedy's tenure, with a significantly altered design completed some years later.  Private funding supported two acquisitions of British art, including David Hockney's A Bigger Grand Canyon in 1999, and Lucian Freud's After C\u00e9zanne in 2001. Kennedy built on the established collections at the museum by acquiring the Holmgren-Spertus collection of Indonesian textiles; the Kenneth Tyler collection of editioned prints, screens, multiples and unique proofs; and the Australian Print Workshop Archive. He was also notable for campaigning for the construction of a new \"front\" entrance to the Gallery, facing King Edward Terrace, which was completed in 2010 (see reference to the building project above).\nKennedy's cancellation of the \"Sensation exhibition\" (scheduled at the NGA from 2 June 2000 to 13 August 2000) was controversial, and seen by some as censorship. He claimed that the decision was due to the exhibition being \"too close to the market\" implying that a national cultural institution cannot exhibit the private collection of a speculative art investor. However, there were other exhibitions at the NGA during his tenure, which could have raised similar concerns. The exhibition featured the privately owned Young British Artists works belonging to Charles Saatchi and attracted large attendances in London and Brooklyn. Its most controversial work was Chris Ofili's The Holy Virgin Mary, a painting which used elephant dung and was accused of being blasphemous. The then-mayor of New York, Rudolph Giuliani, campaigned against the exhibition, claiming it was \"Catholic-bashing\" and an \"aggressive, vicious, disgusting attack on religion.\" In November 1999, Kennedy cancelled the exhibition and stated that the events in New York had \"obscured discussion of the artistic merit of the works of art\". He has said that it \"was the toughest decision of my professional life, so far.\"Kennedy was also repeatedly questioned on his management of a range of issues during the Australian Government's Senate Estimates process - particularly on the NGA's occupational health and safety record and concerns about the NGA's twenty-year-old air-conditioning system. The air-conditioning was finally renovated in 2003. Kennedy announced in 2002 that he would not seek extension of his contract beyond 2004, accepting a seven-year term as had his two predecessors.He became a joint Irish-Australian citizen in 2003.\n\nToledo Museum of Art\nThe Toledo Museum of Art is known for its exceptional collections of European and American paintings and sculpture, glass, antiquities, artist books, Japanese prints and netsuke. The museum offers free admission and is recognized for its historical leadership in the field of art education.  During his tenure, Kennedy has focused the museum's art education efforts on visual literacy, which he defines as \"learning to read, understand and write visual language.\"   Initiatives have included baby and toddler tours, specialized training for all staff, docents, volunteers and the launch of a website, www.vislit.org. In November 2014, the museum hosted the International Visual Literacy Association (IVLA) conference, the first Museum to do so. Kennedy has been a frequent speaker on the topic, including 2010 and 2013 TEDx talks on visual and sensory literacy.\nKennedy has expressed an interest in expanding the museum's collection of contemporary art and art by indigenous peoples. Works by Frank Stella, Sean Scully, Jaume Plensa, Ravinder Reddy and Mary Sibande have been acquired.  In addition, the museum has made major acquisitions of Old Master paintings by Frans Hals and Luca Giordano.During his tenure the Toledo Museum of Art has announced the return of several objects from its collection due to claims the objects were stolen and/or illegally exported prior being sold to the museum.  In 2011 a Meissen sweetmeat stand was returned to Germany followed by an Etruscan Kalpis or water jug to Italy (2013), an Indian sculpture of Ganesha (2014) and an astrological compendium to Germany in 2015.\n\nHood Museum of Art\nKennedy became Director of the Hood Museum of Art in July 2005. During his tenure, he implemented a series of large and small-scale exhibitions and oversaw the production of more than 20 publications to bring greater public attention to the museum's remarkable collections of the arts of America, Europe, Africa, Papua New Guinea and the Polar regions. At 70,000 objects, the Hood has one of the largest collections on any American college of university campus. The exhibition, Black Womanhood: Images, Icons, and Ideologies of the African Body, toured several US venues. Kennedy increased campus curricular use of works of art, with thousands of objects pulled from storage for classes annually. Numerous acquisitions were made with the museum's generous endowments, and he curated several exhibitions: including Wenda Gu: Forest of Stone Steles: Retranslation and Rewriting Tang Dynasty Poetry, Sean Scully: The Art of the Stripe, and Frank Stella: Irregular Polygons.\n\nPublications\nKennedy has written or edited a number of books on art, including:\n\nAlfred Chester Beatty and Ireland 1950-1968: A study in cultural politics, Glendale Press (1988), ISBN 978-0-907606-49-9\nDreams and responsibilities: The state and arts in independent Ireland, Arts Council of Ireland (1990), ISBN 978-0-906627-32-7\nJack B Yeats: Jack Butler Yeats, 1871-1957 (Lives of Irish Artists), Unipub (October 1991), ISBN 978-0-948524-24-0\nThe Anatomy Lesson: Art and Medicine (with Davis Coakley), National Gallery of Ireland (January 1992), ISBN 978-0-903162-65-4\nIreland: Art into History (with Raymond Gillespie), Roberts Rinehart Publishers (1994), ISBN 978-1-57098-005-3\nIrish Painting, Roberts Rinehart Publishers (November 1997),  ISBN 978-1-86059-059-7\nSean Scully: The Art of the Stripe, Hood Museum of Art (October 2008), ISBN 978-0-944722-34-3\nFrank Stella: Irregular Polygons, 1965-1966, Hood Museum of Art (October 2010), ISBN 978-0-944722-39-8\n\nHonors and achievements\nKennedy was awarded the Australian Centenary Medal in 2001 for service to Australian Society and its art. He is a trustee and treasurer of the Association of Art Museum Directors, a peer reviewer for the American Association of Museums and a member of the International Association of Art Critics. In 2013 he was appointed inaugural eminent professor at the University of Toledo and received an honorary doctorate from Lourdes University. Most recently, Kennedy received the 2014 Northwest Region, Ohio Art Education Association award for distinguished educator for art education.\n\n\n== Notes ==\nPassage 5:\nDana Blankstein\nDana Blankstein-Cohen (born March 3, 1981) is the executive director of the Sam Spiegel Film and Television School.

(French: Mais o\u00f9 est donc pass\u00e9e la septi\u00e8me compagnie?) is a 1973 French-Italian comedy war film directed by Robert Lamoureux. The film portrays the adventures of a French Army squad lost somewhere on the front in May 1940 during the Battle of France.\n\nPlot\nDuring the Battle of France, while German forces are spreading across the country, the 7th Transmission Company suffers an air raid near the Machecoul woods, but survive and hide in the woods. Captain Dumont, the company commander, sends Louis Chaudard, Pithiviers and Tassin to scout the area. After burying the radio cable beneath a sandy road, the squad crosses the field, climbs a nearby hill, and takes position within a cemetery. One man cut down the wrong tree for camouflage, pulling up the radio cable and revealing it to the passing German infantry. The Germans cut the cable, surround the woods, and order a puzzled 7th Company to surrender. The squad tries to contact the company, but then witness their capture and run away.\nCommanded by Staff Sergeant Chaudard, the unit stops in a wood for the night. Pithiviers is content to slow down and wait for the end of the campaign. The next day, he goes for a swim in the lake, in sight of possible German fighters. When Chaudard and Tassin wake up, they leave the camp without their weapons to look for Pithiviers. Tassin finds him and gives an angry warning, but Pithiviers convinces Tassin to join him in the lake. Chaudard orders them to get out, but distracted by a rabbit, falls into the lake. While Chaudard teaches his men how to swim, two German fighter planes appear, forcing them out of the water. After shooting down one of the German planes, a French pilot, Lieutenant Duvauchel, makes an emergency landing and escapes before his plane explodes. PFC Pithiviers, seeing the bad shape of one of his shoes, destroys what is left of his shoe sole. Tassin is sent on patrol to get food and a new pair of shoes for Pithiviers. Tassin arrives in a farm, but only finds a dog, so he returns and Chaudard goes to the farm after nightfall. The farmer returns with her daughter-in-law and Lt Duvauchel, and she welcomes Chaudard. Duvauchel, who is hiding behind the door, comes out upon hearing the news and decides to meet Chaudard's men.\nWhen Chaudard and Duvauchel return to the camp, Tassin and Pithiviers are roasting a rabbit they caught. Duvauchel realizes that Chaudard has been lying and takes command.\nThe following day, the men leave the wood in early morning and capture a German armored tow truck after killing its two drivers. They originally planned to abandon the truck and the two dead Germans in the woods, but instead realized that the truck is the best way to disguise themselves and free the 7th Company. They put on the Germans' uniforms, recover another soldier of the 7th Company, who succeeded in escaping, and obtain resources from a collaborator who mistook them for Germans.\nOn their way, they encounter a National Gendarmerie patrol, who appear to be a 5th column. The patrol injures the newest member of their group, a young soldier, and then are killed by Tassin. In revenge, they destroy a German tank using the tow truck's cannon gun.\nThey planned to go to Paris but are misguided by their own colonel, but find the 7th Company with guards who are bringing them to Germany. Using their cover, they make the guards run in front of the truck, allowing the company to get away. When Captain Dumont joins his Chaudard, Tassin, and Pithiviers in the truck, who salute the German commander with a great smile.\n\nCasting\nJean Lefebvre : PFC Pithiviers\nPierre Mondy : Staff Sergent Paul Chaudard\nAldo Maccione: PFC Tassin\nRobert Lamoureux: Colonel Blanchet\nErik Colin: Lieutenant Duvauchel\nPierre Tornade: Captain Dumont\nAlain Doutey: Carlier\nRobert Dalban : The peasant\nJacques Marin: The collaborationist\nRobert Rollis: A French soldier\n\nProduction\nThe film's success spawned two sequels:\u2013 1975 : On a retrouv\u00e9 la septi\u00e8me compagnie (The Seventh Company Has Been Found) by Robert Lamoureux;\n\u2013 1977 : La Septi\u00e8me Compagnie au clair de lune (The Seventh Company Outdoors)) by Robert Lamoureux.The story is set in Machecoul woods, but it was actually filmed near Cerny and La Fert\u00e9-Alais, as well as Jouars-Pontchartrain and Rochefort-en-Yvelines.

It is one of the most celebrated compositions in the popular genre of Rebetiko. It has been described as \"a sort of unofficial national anthem\".\n\nContent\n\"Cloudy Sunday\" is a love song with a strongly melancholy tone. The lyrics emphasize the protagonist's emotion while providing provides little or no factual detail. A. A. Fatouros notes that no name is provided for the female character and that it contains no obvious social or political context. However, he argues that \"[f]or those who have heard it, for those who have danced to its music or sang it, when happy, sad, drunk or nostalgic, the feeling it expresses has a life of its own, an existence independent of any precise cause\". Its first verses read, in Fatouros's translation:\n\nTsitsanis composed the song at Thessaloniki (Salonica) in German-occupied Northern Greece. At the time, he regularly performed to small audiences in a bar he owned as the German occupation authorities considered Rebetiko essentially degenerate and limited its outlets. It is thought to have been composed in 1943 or 1944 in the aftermath of the Great Famine (1941\u201342). Tsitsanis later wrote that \"I wrote the Synnefiasmeni Kyriaki ('Cloudy Sunday') based on the tragic incidents that happened then in our country: starvation, misery, fear, depression, arrests, executions. The lyrics I wrote were inspired by this climate. The melody came out of the 'cloudy' occupation, out of the frustration we all suffered - then, when everything was shadowed under terror and was crushed by slavery.\"Tsitsanis made several recordings of \"Cloudy Sunday\" from 1948. In spite of its limited audience during the occupation period itself, it is strongly associated with it in Greek popular culture.\nPassage 9:\nManousos Manousakis\nManousos Manousakis (Greek: \u039c\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03cd\u03c3\u03bf\u03c2 \u039c\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03ac\u03ba\u03b7\u03c2), is a well-known Greek director, producer, writer and actor.

He was the director of the Peabody Essex Museum in Salem for 17 months, resigning December 31, 2020. He was the director of the Toledo Museum of Art in Ohio from 2010 to 2019. He was the director of the Hood Museum of Art from 2005 to 2010, and the National Gallery of Australia (Canberra) from 1997 to 2004.\n\nCareer\nBrian Kennedy currently lives and works in the United States after leaving Australia in 2005 to direct the Hood Museum of Art at Dartmouth College. In October 2010 he became the ninth Director of the Toledo Museum of Art. On 1 July 2019, he succeeded Dan Monroe as the executive director and CEO of the Peabody Essex Museum.\n\nEarly life and career in Ireland\nKennedy was born in Dublin and attended Clonkeen College. He received B.A. (1982), M.A. (1985) and PhD (1989) degrees from University College-Dublin, where he studied both art history and history.\nHe worked in the Irish Department of Education (1982), the European Commission, Brussels (1983), and in Ireland at the Chester Beatty Library (1983\u201385), Government Publications Office (1985\u201386), and Department of Finance (1986\u201389). He married Mary Fiona Carlin in 1988.He was Assistant Director at the National Gallery of Ireland in Dublin from 1989 to 1997. He was Chair of the Irish Association of Art Historians from 1996 to 1997, and of the Council of Australian Art Museum Directors from 2001 to 2003. In September 1997 he became Director of the National Gallery of Australia.\n\nNational Gallery of Australia (NGA)\nKennedy expanded the traveling exhibitions and loans program throughout Australia, arranged for several major shows of Australian art abroad, increased the number of exhibitions at the museum itself and oversaw the development of an extensive multi-media site.  Although he oversaw several years of the museum's highest ever annual visitation, he discontinued the emphasis of his predecessor, Betty Churcher, on showing \"blockbuster\" exhibitions.\nDuring his directorship, the NGA gained government support for improving the building and significant private donations and corporate sponsorship. However, the initial design for the building proved controversial generating a public dispute with the original architect on moral rights grounds.  As a result, the project was not delivered during Dr Kennedy's tenure, with a significantly altered design completed some years later.  Private funding supported two acquisitions of British art, including David Hockney's A Bigger Grand Canyon in 1999, and Lucian Freud's After C\u00e9zanne in 2001. Kennedy built on the established collections at the museum by acquiring the Holmgren-Spertus collection of Indonesian textiles; the Kenneth Tyler collection of editioned prints, screens, multiples and unique proofs; and the Australian Print Workshop Archive. He was also notable for campaigning for the construction of a new \"front\" entrance to the Gallery, facing King Edward Terrace, which was completed in 2010 (see reference to the building project above).\nKennedy's cancellation of the \"Sensation exhibition\" (scheduled at the NGA from 2 June 2000 to 13 August 2000) was controversial, and seen by some as censorship. He claimed that the decision was due to the exhibition being \"too close to the market\" implying that a national cultural institution cannot exhibit the private collection of a speculative art investor. However, there were other exhibitions at the NGA during his tenure, which could have raised similar concerns. The exhibition featured the privately owned Young British Artists works belonging to Charles Saatchi and attracted large attendances in London and Brooklyn. Its most controversial work was Chris Ofili's The Holy Virgin Mary, a painting which used elephant dung and was accused of being blasphemous. The then-mayor of New York, Rudolph Giuliani, campaigned against the exhibition, claiming it was \"Catholic-bashing\" and an \"aggressive, vicious, disgusting attack on religion.\" In November 1999, Kennedy cancelled the exhibition and stated that the events in New York had \"obscured discussion of the artistic merit of the works of art\". He has said that it \"was the toughest decision of my professional life, so far.\"Kennedy was also repeatedly questioned on his management of a range of issues during the Australian Government's Senate Estimates process - particularly on the NGA's occupational health and safety record and concerns about the NGA's twenty-year-old air-conditioning system. The air-conditioning was finally renovated in 2003. Kennedy announced in 2002 that he would not seek extension of his contract beyond 2004, accepting a seven-year term as had his two predecessors.He became a joint Irish-Australian citizen in 2003.\n\nToledo Museum of Art\nThe Toledo Museum of Art is known for its exceptional collections of European and American paintings and sculpture, glass, antiquities, artist books, Japanese prints and netsuke. The museum offers free admission and is recognized for its historical leadership in the field of art education.  During his tenure, Kennedy has focused the museum's art education efforts on visual literacy, which he defines as \"learning to read, understand and write visual language.\"   Initiatives have included baby and toddler tours, specialized training for all staff, docents, volunteers and the launch of a website, www.vislit.org. In November 2014, the museum hosted the International Visual Literacy Association (IVLA) conference, the first Museum to do so. Kennedy has been a frequent speaker on the topic, including 2010 and 2013 TEDx talks on visual and sensory literacy.\nKennedy has expressed an interest in expanding the museum's collection of contemporary art and art by indigenous peoples. Works by Frank Stella, Sean Scully, Jaume Plensa, Ravinder Reddy and Mary Sibande have been acquired.  In addition, the museum has made major acquisitions of Old Master paintings by Frans Hals and Luca Giordano.During his tenure the Toledo Museum of Art has announced the return of several objects from its collection due to claims the objects were stolen and/or illegally exported prior being sold to the museum.  In 2011 a Meissen sweetmeat stand was returned to Germany followed by an Etruscan Kalpis or water jug to Italy (2013), an Indian sculpture of Ganesha (2014) and an astrological compendium to Germany in 2015.\n\nHood Museum of Art\nKennedy became Director of the Hood Museum of Art in July 2005. During his tenure, he implemented a series of large and small-scale exhibitions and oversaw the production of more than 20 publications to bring greater public attention to the museum's remarkable collections of the arts of America, Europe, Africa, Papua New Guinea and the Polar regions. At 70,000 objects, the Hood has one of the largest collections on any American college of university campus. The exhibition, Black Womanhood: Images, Icons, and Ideologies of the African Body, toured several US venues. Kennedy increased campus curricular use of works of art, with thousands of objects pulled from storage for classes annually. Numerous acquisitions were made with the museum's generous endowments, and he curated several exhibitions: including Wenda Gu: Forest of Stone Steles: Retranslation and Rewriting Tang Dynasty Poetry, Sean Scully: The Art of the Stripe, and Frank Stella: Irregular Polygons.\n\nPublications\nKennedy has written or edited a number of books on art, including:\n\nAlfred Chester Beatty and Ireland 1950-1968: A study in cultural politics, Glendale Press (1988), ISBN 978-0-907606-49-9\nDreams and responsibilities: The state and arts in independent Ireland, Arts Council of Ireland (1990), ISBN 978-0-906627-32-7\nJack B Yeats: Jack Butler Yeats, 1871-1957 (Lives of Irish Artists), Unipub (October 1991), ISBN 978-0-948524-24-0\nThe Anatomy Lesson: Art and Medicine (with Davis Coakley), National Gallery of Ireland (January 1992), ISBN 978-0-903162-65-4\nIreland: Art into History (with Raymond Gillespie), Roberts Rinehart Publishers (1994), ISBN 978-1-57098-005-3\nIrish Painting, Roberts Rinehart Publishers (November 1997),  ISBN 978-1-86059-059-7\nSean Scully: The Art of the Stripe, Hood Museum of Art (October 2008), ISBN 978-0-944722-34-3\nFrank Stella: Irregular Polygons, 1965-1966, Hood Museum of Art (October 2010), ISBN 978-0-944722-39-8\n\nHonors and achievements\nKennedy was awarded the Australian Centenary Medal in 2001 for service to Australian Society and its art. He is a trustee and treasurer of the Association of Art Museum Directors, a peer reviewer for the American Association of Museums and a member of the International Association of Art Critics. In 2013 he was appointed inaugural eminent professor at the University of Toledo and received an honorary doctorate from Lourdes University. Most recently, Kennedy received the 2014 Northwest Region, Ohio Art Education Association award for distinguished educator for art education.\n\n\n== Notes ==\nPassage 5:\nDana Blankstein\nDana Blankstein-Cohen (born March 3, 1981) is the executive director of the Sam Spiegel Film and Television School.

(French: Mais o\u00f9 est donc pass\u00e9e la septi\u00e8me compagnie?) is a 1973 French-Italian comedy war film directed by Robert Lamoureux. The film portrays the adventures of a French Army squad lost somewhere on the front in May 1940 during the Battle of France.\n\nPlot\nDuring the Battle of France, while German forces are spreading across the country, the 7th Transmission Company suffers an air raid near the Machecoul woods, but survive and hide in the woods. Captain Dumont, the company commander, sends Louis Chaudard, Pithiviers and Tassin to scout the area. After burying the radio cable beneath a sandy road, the squad crosses the field, climbs a nearby hill, and takes position within a cemetery. One man cut down the wrong tree for camouflage, pulling up the radio cable and revealing it to the passing German infantry. The Germans cut the cable, surround the woods, and order a puzzled 7th Company to surrender. The squad tries to contact the company, but then witness their capture and run away.\nCommanded by Staff Sergeant Chaudard, the unit stops in a wood for the night. Pithiviers is content to slow down and wait for the end of the campaign. The next day, he goes for a swim in the lake, in sight of possible German fighters. When Chaudard and Tassin wake up, they leave the camp without their weapons to look for Pithiviers. Tassin finds him and gives an angry warning, but Pithiviers convinces Tassin to join him in the lake. Chaudard orders them to get out, but distracted by a rabbit, falls into the lake. While Chaudard teaches his men how to swim, two German fighter planes appear, forcing them out of the water. After shooting down one of the German planes, a French pilot, Lieutenant Duvauchel, makes an emergency landing and escapes before his plane explodes. PFC Pithiviers, seeing the bad shape of one of his shoes, destroys what is left of his shoe sole. Tassin is sent on patrol to get food and a new pair of shoes for Pithiviers. Tassin arrives in a farm, but only finds a dog, so he returns and Chaudard goes to the farm after nightfall. The farmer returns with her daughter-in-law and Lt Duvauchel, and she welcomes Chaudard. Duvauchel, who is hiding behind the door, comes out upon hearing the news and decides to meet Chaudard's men.\nWhen Chaudard and Duvauchel return to the camp, Tassin and Pithiviers are roasting a rabbit they caught. Duvauchel realizes that Chaudard has been lying and takes command.\nThe following day, the men leave the wood in early morning and capture a German armored tow truck after killing its two drivers. They originally planned to abandon the truck and the two dead Germans in the woods, but instead realized that the truck is the best way to disguise themselves and free the 7th Company. They put on the Germans' uniforms, recover another soldier of the 7th Company, who succeeded in escaping, and obtain resources from a collaborator who mistook them for Germans.\nOn their way, they encounter a National Gendarmerie patrol, who appear to be a 5th column. The patrol injures the newest member of their group, a young soldier, and then are killed by Tassin. In revenge, they destroy a German tank using the tow truck's cannon gun.\nThey planned to go to Paris but are misguided by their own colonel, but find the 7th Company with guards who are bringing them to Germany. Using their cover, they make the guards run in front of the truck, allowing the company to get away. When Captain Dumont joins his Chaudard, Tassin, and Pithiviers in the truck, who salute the German commander with a great smile.\n\nCasting\nJean Lefebvre : PFC Pithiviers\nPierre Mondy : Staff Sergent Paul Chaudard\nAldo Maccione: PFC Tassin\nRobert Lamoureux: Colonel Blanchet\nErik Colin: Lieutenant Duvauchel\nPierre Tornade: Captain Dumont\nAlain Doutey: Carlier\nRobert Dalban : The peasant\nJacques Marin: The collaborationist\nRobert Rollis: A French soldier\n\nProduction\nThe film's success spawned two sequels:\u2013 1975 : On a retrouv\u00e9 la septi\u00e8me compagnie (The Seventh Company Has Been Found) by Robert Lamoureux;\n\u2013 1977 : La Septi\u00e8me Compagnie au clair de lune (The Seventh Company Outdoors)) by Robert Lamoureux.The story is set in Machecoul woods, but it was actually filmed near Cerny and La Fert\u00e9-Alais, as well as Jouars-Pontchartrain and Rochefort-en-Yvelines.

It is one of the most celebrated compositions in the popular genre of Rebetiko. It has been described as \"a sort of unofficial national anthem\".\n\nContent\n\"Cloudy Sunday\" is a love song with a strongly melancholy tone. The lyrics emphasize the protagonist's emotion while providing provides little or no factual detail. A. A. Fatouros notes that no name is provided for the female character and that it contains no obvious social or political context. However, he argues that \"[f]or those who have heard it, for those who have danced to its music or sang it, when happy, sad, drunk or nostalgic, the feeling it expresses has a life of its own, an existence independent of any precise cause\". Its first verses read, in Fatouros's translation:\n\nTsitsanis composed the song at Thessaloniki (Salonica) in German-occupied Northern Greece. At the time, he regularly performed to small audiences in a bar he owned as the German occupation authorities considered Rebetiko essentially degenerate and limited its outlets. It is thought to have been composed in 1943 or 1944 in the aftermath of the Great Famine (1941\u201342). Tsitsanis later wrote that \"I wrote the Synnefiasmeni Kyriaki ('Cloudy Sunday') based on the tragic incidents that happened then in our country: starvation, misery, fear, depression, arrests, executions. The lyrics I wrote were inspired by this climate. The melody came out of the 'cloudy' occupation, out of the frustration we all suffered - then, when everything was shadowed under terror and was crushed by slavery.\"Tsitsanis made several recordings of \"Cloudy Sunday\" from 1948. In spite of its limited audience during the occupation period itself, it is strongly associated with it in Greek popular culture.\nPassage 9:\nManousos Manousakis\nManousos Manousakis (Greek: \u039c\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03cd\u03c3\u03bf\u03c2 \u039c\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03ac\u03ba\u03b7\u03c2), is a well-known Greek director, producer, writer and actor.

Other cast members include Lucie Mannheim, Raymond Lovell and Herbert Lom. It was based on Eric Ambler's 1938 novel Epitaph for a Spy. Unusually, it was both directed and produced by a trio: Lance Comfort, Mutz Greenbaum and Victor Hanbury. It was shot at Denham Studios with sets designed by the art director William C. Andrews. The film was produced and distributed by the British branch of RKO Pictures.\n\nPlot\nIn 1938, refugee Peter Vadassy decides to take a holiday at the Hotel Reserve to celebrate both his completion of medical school and his impending French citizenship. When he goes to pick up some photographs at the local pharmacy, he is taken away and questioned by Michel Beghin of French naval intelligence. When his negatives had been developed, some of them turned out to be of French military installations. It is discovered that while the camera is the same make as Peter's, the serial number is different. Peter is released on condition that he find out which other hotel guests have cameras like his.\nPeter does some snooping and eavesdrops on a suspicious conversation between Paul Heimberger and the hotel's proprietor, Madame Suzanne Koch. He searches Heimberger's room and finds several passports, all with different names and nationalities. Heimberger catches him in the act, but eventually matters are straightened out. Heimberger explains that he was originally a Social Democratic newspaper publisher who was anti-Nazi and been sent to a concentration camp for two years. After he was released, he joined an underground movement against the German regime.\nPeter spots his camera in the pocket of a dressing-gown belonging to Odette and Andre Roux, a couple on their honeymoon. Andre first tries to bribe Peter into giving him the negative and, when that fails, threatens him with a pistol. The police arrive at that moment and arrest Peter for espionage.\nThe Rouxs leave the hotel, but find Heimberger trying to disable the hotel's car. Andre shoots him dead and the couple speed off to Toulon, unaware that they are being tracked by the police. Beghin had known the identity of the spies all along and merely used Peter to further his true goal; to find out who the Rouxs are reporting to. The spy ring is captured. Andre gets away, but is caught on a roof by Peter.

Tudor\nC.J. Tudor is a British author whose books include The Chalk Man and The Hiding Place (The Taking of Annie Thorne). She was born in Salisbury, England but grew up in Nottingham, where she still lives.\n\nThe Chalk Man\nThe Chalk Man was published in January 2018 by Crown Publishing. Reviews were mixed. The Sun said \"[Tudor] weaves a complex and captivating story in her first novel.\". The Irish Independent said the book \"has an intriguing and creepy premise - but ultimately falls apart after a series of improbable, shading to outlandish, plot twists.\" The book received the 2019 Barry Award for Best First Novel.\n\nThe Sixth\nA book which to be called \"The Sixth\" was planned in 2022. But with a difficult 12 months between 2020 and 2021, a manuscript was written (approximately 86,000 words) and submitted to the publisher. Unhappy with the result, Tudor got a return from her editor that the book didn't work and needed a complete re-write. Not willing to do the job, Tudor preferred to offer a new book to be published in January 2023 and her publisher will instead publish her first short story collection in Autumn 2022.\n\nBibliography\nBooks\nThe Chalk Man\nThe Taking of Annie Thorne (The Hiding Place)\nThe Other People\nThe Burning Girls\n\u201cA Sliver of Darkness\u201d\n\u201cThe Drift\u201d\n\nShort stories\nThe Man in the Box-Included in \"The Other People\" audiobook\nThe Lion at the Gate-Included in \"The Other People\" audiobook\nThe February House-Included in \"The Other People\" audiobook\nButterfly Island in After Sundown anthology\nPassage 7:\nReturn to the Hiding Place\nReturn to the Hiding Place is a 2013 film based upon the factual accounting of Hans Poley's World War II encounter with Corrie ten Boom, her involvement in the Dutch resistance and the wartime harboring of Jewish refugees. A non-Jewish fugitive after he refused to pledge his allegiance to the Nazis, Poley was the first person hidden from the Nazis in the Ten Boom House, which is today a museum in Haarlem, Netherlands.  The film is adapted, in part, from Poley's book, Return to the Hiding Place (1993),  personal recollections, relayed to screenwriter Dr. Peter C. Spencer, and research from the Dutch National Archives. The film is neither a prequel nor is it a sequel to the 1975 film The Hiding Place, instead, it is a congruent accounting of the Dutch underground's resistance efforts from Poley's perspective.  It was directed by Peter C. Spencer and starred John Rhys-Davies, Mimi Sagadin and Craig Robert Young.\n\nBackground\nOn May 15, 1940, German occupation of the Netherlands begins with the nation's surrender, food and materials are rationed and evening curfews are imposed, gradually tightening from 10:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m. Persecution of the Jewish population also is gradually implemented, starting with the requirement of wearing a yellow star bearing the word \"Jew\" and attacks against Jewish businesses and places of worship and culminating in the mass transport of Jewish citizens to unknown locations. Conspiracy theories begin to emerge on the fate of those being transported to the concentration camps.Corrie ten Boom (15 April 1892 \u2013 15 April 1983) and her family are actively involved in the Dutch underground, invite the persecuted to live in their home and create a hidden room to conceal them during searches. Hans Poley, a young Christian, is the first guest and benefactor of the ten Boom family's extraordinary hospitality in May 1943.Poley's persecution begins with his refusal to sign the Nazi Manifesto, which reads in part:\n\n23. We demand legal opposition to known lies and their promulgation through the press. In order to enable the provision of a German press, we demand, that:a. All writers and employees of the newspapers appearing in the German language be members of the race;\nb. Non-German newspapers be required to have the express permission of the State to be published. They may not be printed in the German language;\nc. Non-Germans are forbidden by law any financial interest in German publications, or any influence on them, and as punishment for violations the closing of such a publication as well as the immediate expulsion from the Reich of the non-German concerned. Publications that are counter to the general good are to be forbidden. We demand legal prosecution of artistic and literary forms which exert a destructive influence on our national life, and the closure of organizations opposing the above-made demands.24. We demand freedom of religion for all religious denominations within the state so long as they do not endanger its existence or oppose the moral senses of the Germanic race. The Party as such advocates the standpoint of a positive Christianity without binding itself confessionally to any one denomination. It combats the Jewish-materialistic spirit within and around us, and is convinced that a lasting recovery of our nation can only succeed from within the framework: The good of the state before the good of the individual.25. For the execution of all of this we demand the formation of a strong central power in the Reich. Unlimited authority of the central parliament over the whole Reich and its organizations in general. The forming of state and profession chambers for the execution of the laws made by the Reich within the various states of the confederation. The leaders of the Party promise, if necessary by sacrificing their own lives, to support the execution of the points set forth above without consideration.\n\nCast\nCast overview, first billed only:\n\nFilming locations\nHaarlem, North Holland, Netherlands\nHolland, Michigan, USA\nManistee, Michigan, USA\n\nAwards\nSee also\nReturn to the Hiding Place, by Hans Poley, Lifejourney Books (1993) ISBN 0781409322\nThe Hiding Place, a 1971 autobiography by Corrie ten Boom\nThe Hiding Place, a 1975 film based on the book by Corrie ten Boom\nPassage 8:\nReserve\nReserve or reserves may refer to:\n\nPlaces\nReserve, Kansas, a US city\nReserve, Louisiana,  a census-designated place in St. John the Baptist Parish\nReserve, Montana, a census-designated place in Sheridan County\nReserve, New Mexico, a US village\nReserve, Wisconsin, a census-designated place in the town of Couderay\nReserve Mines, a community in Cape Breton Regional Municipality, Nova Scotia, Canada\n\nAuctions\nAuction reserve, a minimum amount of money bid required for a sale, e.g., in an English auction\nNo-reserve auction (NR), also known as an absolute auction, an auction in which the item for sale will be sold regardless of price\n\nEconomics and finance\nReserve (accounting), any part of shareholders' equity, except for basic share capital\nActuarial reserves, a liability equal to the present value of the future expected cash flows of a contingent event\nBank reserves, holdings of deposits in central banks plus currency that is physically held in bank vaults\nForeign-exchange reserves, the foreign currency deposits held by central banks and monetary authorities\nReserve currency, a currency which is held in significant quantities as part of foreign exchange reserves\nMineral reserve, natural resources that are economically recoverable\nOfficial gold reserves, gold held by central banks as a store of value\nReserve study, a long-term capital budget planning tool\n\nLand management\nGame reserve, land set aside for maintenance of wildlife, for tourism or hunting\nIndian reserve, a tract of land reserved for the use and benefit of a band\nIndian colony, the concept in the United States\nIndian reservation, equivalent concept in the United States\nIndian reserve, equivalent concept in Canada\nUrban Indian reserve, equivalent concept in Canada\nNature reserve, a protected area of importance for wildlife, flora, fauna or features of geological or other special interest\nOpen space reserve, an area of protected or conserved land or water on which development is indefinitely set aside\n\nMilitary\nMilitary reserve, military units not initially committed to battle\nMilitary reserve force, a military organization composed of citizens who combine a military role with a civilian career\nReserve fleet, a collection of partially or fully decommissioned naval vessels not currently needed.\n\nSports\nReserve (sport), a player not in the starting lineup\nInjured reserve list, a list of injured players temporarily unable to play\nReserve clause, part of a player contract in North American professional sports\nReserve team, the second team fielded by a sports club\n\nOther uses\nAboriginal reserve, historical government-run settlement in Australia\nCourse reserve, library materials reserved for particular users\nDynamic reserve, the set of metabolites that an organism can use for metabolic purposes\nFuel reserve, an extra fuel tank, or extra fuel in the main fuel tank\nInjury Reserve, an Arizona hip hop trio formed in 2013\nReserve Police Officers, auxiliary police officers\nReserve power, a power that may be exercised by the head of state without the approval of another branch of the government\nReserve wine, a wine that is specially designated\nReserved, a Polish clothing store chain\nStockpile, a reserve of bulk materials for future use\n\nSee also\nHold\nLayaway\nNative Reserve (disambiguation)\nPreserve (disambiguation)\nReserva (disambiguation)\nReservation (disambiguation)\nReservoir (disambiguation)\nWestern Reserve (disambiguation)\nAll pages with titles beginning with Reserve \nAll pages with titles containing Reserve\nPassage 9:\nSituation Hopeless... But Not Serious\nSituation Hopeless... But Not Serious is a 1965 oddball comedy film shot in black and white directed by Gottfried Reinhardt and starring Alec Guinness, Mike Connors and Robert Redford. It is based on the 1960 novel The Hiding Place by Robert Shaw.\nThe title is a derived from Viennese Alfred Polgar's quip, \"The situation is desperate but not serious.\"\n\nPlot\nOn 27 November 1944, during World War II, two American fliers, Captain Hank Wilson and Sergeant Lucky Finder, have to bail out over Germany. They land in the small town of Altheim, where Wilhelm Frick reads his horoscope and it says an exciting change will happen that day.\nIn town, the fliers hide in Frick's cellar. He initially locks them in and is going to inform the authorities when one claims German descent and he softens. They sing German songs together. Frick decides to hide them from the authorities. He leaves them locked there and goes to his job as the pharmacist's assistant at Drogerie Neusel. His boss listens to the radio regarding the Allied advance: the Germans have lost Aachen ... the end of the war is close. American troops march through Altheim outside Frick's work.\nThe two Americans (Finder and Wilson) share the cellar with Frick's cats. They get hobbies: one sketching cartoons while the other does metalwork, which enables him to make a lockpick and they unlock themselves just as Frick returns. Finder has Frick's gun and turns it on him. They debate what will happen if they leave. He convinces them to stay. To ensure they stay, he puts them in shackles while they sleep. He tells them they must stay until the end of the war. He gives them the key to unlock themselves.\nHe brings them a very pretty little Christmas tree. The story then jumps to VE Day (May 1945) with Frick listening to the radio announcement regarding the end of the war.\nThe two have to reshackle themselves when Frick brings them food. On VE Day, he brings a large bottle of 10 year old Swiss kirsch and is about to tell them the news. By the third tumbler of kirsch, Frick is spilling as he pours and all are singing. Frick offers to give them cushions, books... and sunshine.\nFrick's boss is arrested as a Nazi sympathiser. Finder grows a long beard. Outside, this part of Germany comes under American occupation. Frick tries to barter for extra supplies from the local American quartermaster.\nIn his struggle to keep them entertained, Frick lets slip some Americanisms and Finder queries how he knows them. Frick gives them a false history of the war and simply says that the Americans have captured Strasbourg. He gives them an orange stamped with the word California and they become suspicious. Struggling to explain, he distracts them by saying Paris is totally destroyed.\nFinder demands a woman and Frick starts to search. He peers in the window of the Daffodil Club and gets invited inside. Inside, he meets Lissie, a madam, who offers him a choice of girls at the bar. He prefers to use her and starts to explain things to her. His conversation in her back office worries her so much that she presses her silent alarm and he gets thrown out.\nFrick seems to go a bit crazy and is put in a hospital, but security is lax and he steals a bike and goes home. His house is dilapidated... it is unclear how long he has been gone. He unlocks the men. Two police appear outside (for the stolen bike). They ask if Switzerland is still neutral.\nFinder steals Frick's luger pistol and runs off into the night. The police pursue him presuming he is a robber. In daylight, the two men end in an old ruined castle above a river. The police still pursue them. Frick appears and stops a shooting.\nNext, the two Americans are hiding in large pipes. They find a scrap of newspaper discussing President Truman and the Iron curtain.\nThe authorities investigate Frick's house and conclude he has had two people imprisoned.\nThe two men try to steal a small boat and are spotted by Wanda, the daughter of the owner. She presumes they have escaped from the American stockade. She invites them in for a \"crazy time\". They pay $750 to be taken over the Rhine and offer $1000 for a telephone. A boat of SS troops appears - but they are making a movie. They start to realise things are not as they think. A fist fight starts and spreads through the crowd.\nThe game is up and the two fly back to San Francisco. It is Christmas and they are in a bar getting drunk. Frick appears at the window. Frick ends serving drinks at their party.\n\nCast\nAlec Guinness as Wilhelm Frick\nMike Connors as Sgt.

Tudor\nC.J. Tudor is a British author whose books include The Chalk Man and The Hiding Place (The Taking of Annie Thorne). She was born in Salisbury, England but grew up in Nottingham, where she still lives.\n\nThe Chalk Man\nThe Chalk Man was published in January 2018 by Crown Publishing. Reviews were mixed. The Sun said \"[Tudor] weaves a complex and captivating story in her first novel.\". The Irish Independent said the book \"has an intriguing and creepy premise - but ultimately falls apart after a series of improbable, shading to outlandish, plot twists.\" The book received the 2019 Barry Award for Best First Novel.\n\nThe Sixth\nA book which to be called \"The Sixth\" was planned in 2022. But with a difficult 12 months between 2020 and 2021, a manuscript was written (approximately 86,000 words) and submitted to the publisher. Unhappy with the result, Tudor got a return from her editor that the book didn't work and needed a complete re-write. Not willing to do the job, Tudor preferred to offer a new book to be published in January 2023 and her publisher will instead publish her first short story collection in Autumn 2022.\n\nBibliography\nBooks\nThe Chalk Man\nThe Taking of Annie Thorne (The Hiding Place)\nThe Other People\nThe Burning Girls\n\u201cA Sliver of Darkness\u201d\n\u201cThe Drift\u201d\n\nShort stories\nThe Man in the Box-Included in \"The Other People\" audiobook\nThe Lion at the Gate-Included in \"The Other People\" audiobook\nThe February House-Included in \"The Other People\" audiobook\nButterfly Island in After Sundown anthology\nPassage 7:\nReturn to the Hiding Place\nReturn to the Hiding Place is a 2013 film based upon the factual accounting of Hans Poley's World War II encounter with Corrie ten Boom, her involvement in the Dutch resistance and the wartime harboring of Jewish refugees. A non-Jewish fugitive after he refused to pledge his allegiance to the Nazis, Poley was the first person hidden from the Nazis in the Ten Boom House, which is today a museum in Haarlem, Netherlands.  The film is adapted, in part, from Poley's book, Return to the Hiding Place (1993),  personal recollections, relayed to screenwriter Dr. Peter C. Spencer, and research from the Dutch National Archives. The film is neither a prequel nor is it a sequel to the 1975 film The Hiding Place, instead, it is a congruent accounting of the Dutch underground's resistance efforts from Poley's perspective.  It was directed by Peter C. Spencer and starred John Rhys-Davies, Mimi Sagadin and Craig Robert Young.\n\nBackground\nOn May 15, 1940, German occupation of the Netherlands begins with the nation's surrender, food and materials are rationed and evening curfews are imposed, gradually tightening from 10:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m. Persecution of the Jewish population also is gradually implemented, starting with the requirement of wearing a yellow star bearing the word \"Jew\" and attacks against Jewish businesses and places of worship and culminating in the mass transport of Jewish citizens to unknown locations. Conspiracy theories begin to emerge on the fate of those being transported to the concentration camps.Corrie ten Boom (15 April 1892 \u2013 15 April 1983) and her family are actively involved in the Dutch underground, invite the persecuted to live in their home and create a hidden room to conceal them during searches. Hans Poley, a young Christian, is the first guest and benefactor of the ten Boom family's extraordinary hospitality in May 1943.Poley's persecution begins with his refusal to sign the Nazi Manifesto, which reads in part:\n\n23. We demand legal opposition to known lies and their promulgation through the press. In order to enable the provision of a German press, we demand, that:a. All writers and employees of the newspapers appearing in the German language be members of the race;\nb. Non-German newspapers be required to have the express permission of the State to be published. They may not be printed in the German language;\nc. Non-Germans are forbidden by law any financial interest in German publications, or any influence on them, and as punishment for violations the closing of such a publication as well as the immediate expulsion from the Reich of the non-German concerned. Publications that are counter to the general good are to be forbidden. We demand legal prosecution of artistic and literary forms which exert a destructive influence on our national life, and the closure of organizations opposing the above-made demands.24. We demand freedom of religion for all religious denominations within the state so long as they do not endanger its existence or oppose the moral senses of the Germanic race. The Party as such advocates the standpoint of a positive Christianity without binding itself confessionally to any one denomination. It combats the Jewish-materialistic spirit within and around us, and is convinced that a lasting recovery of our nation can only succeed from within the framework: The good of the state before the good of the individual.25. For the execution of all of this we demand the formation of a strong central power in the Reich. Unlimited authority of the central parliament over the whole Reich and its organizations in general. The forming of state and profession chambers for the execution of the laws made by the Reich within the various states of the confederation. The leaders of the Party promise, if necessary by sacrificing their own lives, to support the execution of the points set forth above without consideration.\n\nCast\nCast overview, first billed only:\n\nFilming locations\nHaarlem, North Holland, Netherlands\nHolland, Michigan, USA\nManistee, Michigan, USA\n\nAwards\nSee also\nReturn to the Hiding Place, by Hans Poley, Lifejourney Books (1993) ISBN 0781409322\nThe Hiding Place, a 1971 autobiography by Corrie ten Boom\nThe Hiding Place, a 1975 film based on the book by Corrie ten Boom\nPassage 8:\nReserve\nReserve or reserves may refer to:\n\nPlaces\nReserve, Kansas, a US city\nReserve, Louisiana,  a census-designated place in St. John the Baptist Parish\nReserve, Montana, a census-designated place in Sheridan County\nReserve, New Mexico, a US village\nReserve, Wisconsin, a census-designated place in the town of Couderay\nReserve Mines, a community in Cape Breton Regional Municipality, Nova Scotia, Canada\n\nAuctions\nAuction reserve, a minimum amount of money bid required for a sale, e.g., in an English auction\nNo-reserve auction (NR), also known as an absolute auction, an auction in which the item for sale will be sold regardless of price\n\nEconomics and finance\nReserve (accounting), any part of shareholders' equity, except for basic share capital\nActuarial reserves, a liability equal to the present value of the future expected cash flows of a contingent event\nBank reserves, holdings of deposits in central banks plus currency that is physically held in bank vaults\nForeign-exchange reserves, the foreign currency deposits held by central banks and monetary authorities\nReserve currency, a currency which is held in significant quantities as part of foreign exchange reserves\nMineral reserve, natural resources that are economically recoverable\nOfficial gold reserves, gold held by central banks as a store of value\nReserve study, a long-term capital budget planning tool\n\nLand management\nGame reserve, land set aside for maintenance of wildlife, for tourism or hunting\nIndian reserve, a tract of land reserved for the use and benefit of a band\nIndian colony, the concept in the United States\nIndian reservation, equivalent concept in the United States\nIndian reserve, equivalent concept in Canada\nUrban Indian reserve, equivalent concept in Canada\nNature reserve, a protected area of importance for wildlife, flora, fauna or features of geological or other special interest\nOpen space reserve, an area of protected or conserved land or water on which development is indefinitely set aside\n\nMilitary\nMilitary reserve, military units not initially committed to battle\nMilitary reserve force, a military organization composed of citizens who combine a military role with a civilian career\nReserve fleet, a collection of partially or fully decommissioned naval vessels not currently needed.\n\nSports\nReserve (sport), a player not in the starting lineup\nInjured reserve list, a list of injured players temporarily unable to play\nReserve clause, part of a player contract in North American professional sports\nReserve team, the second team fielded by a sports club\n\nOther uses\nAboriginal reserve, historical government-run settlement in Australia\nCourse reserve, library materials reserved for particular users\nDynamic reserve, the set of metabolites that an organism can use for metabolic purposes\nFuel reserve, an extra fuel tank, or extra fuel in the main fuel tank\nInjury Reserve, an Arizona hip hop trio formed in 2013\nReserve Police Officers, auxiliary police officers\nReserve power, a power that may be exercised by the head of state without the approval of another branch of the government\nReserve wine, a wine that is specially designated\nReserved, a Polish clothing store chain\nStockpile, a reserve of bulk materials for future use\n\nSee also\nHold\nLayaway\nNative Reserve (disambiguation)\nPreserve (disambiguation)\nReserva (disambiguation)\nReservation (disambiguation)\nReservoir (disambiguation)\nWestern Reserve (disambiguation)\nAll pages with titles beginning with Reserve \nAll pages with titles containing Reserve\nPassage 9:\nSituation Hopeless... But Not Serious\nSituation Hopeless... But Not Serious is a 1965 oddball comedy film shot in black and white directed by Gottfried Reinhardt and starring Alec Guinness, Mike Connors and Robert Redford. It is based on the 1960 novel The Hiding Place by Robert Shaw.\nThe title is a derived from Viennese Alfred Polgar's quip, \"The situation is desperate but not serious.\"\n\nPlot\nOn 27 November 1944, during World War II, two American fliers, Captain Hank Wilson and Sergeant Lucky Finder, have to bail out over Germany. They land in the small town of Altheim, where Wilhelm Frick reads his horoscope and it says an exciting change will happen that day.\nIn town, the fliers hide in Frick's cellar. He initially locks them in and is going to inform the authorities when one claims German descent and he softens. They sing German songs together. Frick decides to hide them from the authorities. He leaves them locked there and goes to his job as the pharmacist's assistant at Drogerie Neusel. His boss listens to the radio regarding the Allied advance: the Germans have lost Aachen ... the end of the war is close. American troops march through Altheim outside Frick's work.\nThe two Americans (Finder and Wilson) share the cellar with Frick's cats. They get hobbies: one sketching cartoons while the other does metalwork, which enables him to make a lockpick and they unlock themselves just as Frick returns. Finder has Frick's gun and turns it on him. They debate what will happen if they leave. He convinces them to stay. To ensure they stay, he puts them in shackles while they sleep. He tells them they must stay until the end of the war. He gives them the key to unlock themselves.\nHe brings them a very pretty little Christmas tree. The story then jumps to VE Day (May 1945) with Frick listening to the radio announcement regarding the end of the war.\nThe two have to reshackle themselves when Frick brings them food. On VE Day, he brings a large bottle of 10 year old Swiss kirsch and is about to tell them the news. By the third tumbler of kirsch, Frick is spilling as he pours and all are singing. Frick offers to give them cushions, books... and sunshine.\nFrick's boss is arrested as a Nazi sympathiser. Finder grows a long beard. Outside, this part of Germany comes under American occupation. Frick tries to barter for extra supplies from the local American quartermaster.\nIn his struggle to keep them entertained, Frick lets slip some Americanisms and Finder queries how he knows them. Frick gives them a false history of the war and simply says that the Americans have captured Strasbourg. He gives them an orange stamped with the word California and they become suspicious. Struggling to explain, he distracts them by saying Paris is totally destroyed.\nFinder demands a woman and Frick starts to search. He peers in the window of the Daffodil Club and gets invited inside. Inside, he meets Lissie, a madam, who offers him a choice of girls at the bar. He prefers to use her and starts to explain things to her. His conversation in her back office worries her so much that she presses her silent alarm and he gets thrown out.\nFrick seems to go a bit crazy and is put in a hospital, but security is lax and he steals a bike and goes home. His house is dilapidated... it is unclear how long he has been gone. He unlocks the men. Two police appear outside (for the stolen bike). They ask if Switzerland is still neutral.\nFinder steals Frick's luger pistol and runs off into the night. The police pursue him presuming he is a robber. In daylight, the two men end in an old ruined castle above a river. The police still pursue them. Frick appears and stops a shooting.\nNext, the two Americans are hiding in large pipes. They find a scrap of newspaper discussing President Truman and the Iron curtain.\nThe authorities investigate Frick's house and conclude he has had two people imprisoned.\nThe two men try to steal a small boat and are spotted by Wanda, the daughter of the owner. She presumes they have escaped from the American stockade. She invites them in for a \"crazy time\". They pay $750 to be taken over the Rhine and offer $1000 for a telephone. A boat of SS troops appears - but they are making a movie. They start to realise things are not as they think. A fist fight starts and spreads through the crowd.\nThe game is up and the two fly back to San Francisco. It is Christmas and they are in a bar getting drunk. Frick appears at the window. Frick ends serving drinks at their party.\n\nCast\nAlec Guinness as Wilhelm Frick\nMike Connors as Sgt.

In the first few years of their marriage, the couple lived in Spain. They later settled in Rhodesia (now known as Zimbabwe).

W. Botha, declared his maternity ward extraterritorial land, to ensure that Leka was born on Albanian soil. Leka is the only child of Leka, Crown Prince of Albania and his wife Susan, Crown Princess of Albania. He is the only grandchild of King Zog I of the Albanians, succeeding as head of the royal house upon the death of his father in 2011. He has worked as an official at the country's interior and foreign ministries. He also served as a political advisor to the Albanian President from 2012 to 2013.In May 2010, Leka became engaged to Elia Zaharia, an Albanian actress and singer. They married on 8 October 2016 in Tirana.\n\nEarly life\nLeka is the son of the pretender to the defunct throne of Albania, Crown Prince Leka, and his Australian wife Crown Princess Susan.\nHe was named in honour of Egyptian president Anwar El Sadat, his grandfather King Zog I, Emperor Mohammed Reza of Iran, and Baudouin I, King of the Belgians. Msiziwe is a Zulu term meaning 'the one who was assisted'. Leka is a member of the House of Zogu.\n\nEducation and activities\nLeka's was educated in South Africa at St Peter's College, Johannesburg, and in the United Kingdom at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, where he was named Best Foreign Student of the Academy, being congratulated by the Albanian Minister of Defence. He was also educated at the Skanderbeg Military Academy in Albania, at the Universit\u00e0 per Stranieri in Perugia, where he studied the Italian language, and in Kosovo, where he studied international relations.Leka resides in Tirana. He speaks Albanian, English, some Zulu, and Italian. He owns boxer dogs, and his interests include martial arts, volleyball, and swimming. He is fond of wildlife and has taken part in mountain climbing, abseiling, and target shooting.On 5 April 2004, Leka accepted the Mother Teresa Medal on behalf of his late grandmother, Queen G\u00e9raldine, for her humanitarian efforts.Leka is known to have worked with youth organizations, like MJAFT!, and supported a wide range of humanitarian efforts in Albania, but he maintains that he only supports self-help projects to stimulate Albanian and Kosovar economic growth, Gazeta Sot.Leka is known as a supporter of Kosovar independence from Serbia and has close ties to the Kosovar leadership in Pristina.Leka founded the youth leadership of the Movement for National Development, which was a movement created by his father in 2005 to change the political face of Albania.On 24 June 2010, Prince Leka unveiled a blue plaque at Parmoor House in Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom, which was the home of King Zog during his wartime exile.\n\nPublic service\nOn 21 August 2007, Foreign Minister Lulzim Basha announced that Leka had been appointed to his office. The prince intended to pursue a career in diplomacy. After three years he had been transferred to the office of the Minister of Interior. After the election of Bujar Nishani as president in 2012, Leka was appointed as political adviser to the President.Leka was considered as a candidate in the 2022 Albanian presidential election, though the position ultimately went to Bajram Begaj.\n\nPersonal life\nLeka met Elia Zaharia in Paris, and in May 2010 they were engaged. Since then she has accompanied him on most of his visits and meetings with members of royal families. She is also head of the Queen Geraldine Foundation, which is a humanitarian, charitable and non-profit organisation, created by the Royal Court. The foundation aims to be close to the Albanian families who need help and to children who need care. It has reconstructed numerous schools and kindergartens in northern Albania, especially in the Mat District, from where the Zogu Family comes.\nOn 27 March 2016 it was announced by Sk\u00ebnder Zogu (born 1933), a member of the Zogu family, that the couple would be married on 8 October 2016 in the Royal Palace in Tirana.\n\nWedding\nLeka was married on Saturday 8 October 2016 in Tirana. The ceremony was a semi-official ceremony, held in Tirana in the Royal Palace, with many guests including members of other noble and royal families. The event was a civil wedding officiated by the Mayor of Tirana, Erion Veliaj. A blessing was given by the five religious leaders of Albania representing the faiths of Sunni Islam, Bektashi, and the Christian traditions of Orthodox, Catholic and Protestant. This tradition of the Albanian royal family is part of the tradition of religious tolerance in Albania.Wedding guests included friends and relatives from around the world including relatives of his mother from Australia. Guests also included members of other royal families from neighbouring countries and further afield. These included Queen Sof\u00eda of Spain and Prince and Princess Michael of Kent. Prince Michael of Kent is a first cousin of Queen Elizabeth II and his wife Princess Michael of Kent is related to Prince Leka through her mother, Countess Marianne Szap\u00e1ry, who was a 5th cousin of Queen G\u00e9raldine and had been a bridesmaid at her wedding to King Zog in 1938.

Meanwhile, Albania itself was a communist republic.\n\nEarly life\nSusan Cullen-Ward was born in the Sydney suburb of Waverley. Her mother was Phyllis Dorothea Murray-Prior and her father was Alan Robert Cullen-Ward, a pastoralist. Susan Cullen-Ward was a great-granddaughter of the Queensland politician Thomas Lodge Murray-Prior (1819\u20131892).\nCullen-Ward grew up on her father's sheep station. She attended Presbyterian Ladies' College at Orange, then studied at Sydney Technical College before teaching art at a private studio.She was married to Richard Williams from 1965 to 1970. Susan Cullen-Ward was an Anglican.\n\nMarriage to the Crown Prince of Albania\nSusan Cullen-Ward met Leka, Crown Prince of Albania, the only child of King Zog I of the Albanians, at a dinner party in Sydney. In October 1975, they married in a civil ceremony in Biarritz, France. The couple were later married in a religious ceremony in Madrid.\nAustralian authorities refused to recognise her as a queen but, in a compromise when Andrew Peacock was foreign minister, issued a passport in the name of \"Susan Cullen-Ward, known as Queen Susan\".She lived a turbulent life after marrying Leka, as they moved from one country to another, having no permanent residence or fixed point of reference. In the first few years of their marriage, the couple lived in Spain. They later settled in Rhodesia (now known as Zimbabwe). After a falling out with the government of Robert Mugabe, the couple moved again, this time to South Africa where their son, Leka, was born in 1982. She also had a stillborn daughter while resident in Rhodesia.\n\nDeath\nThe Crown Princess of Albania died of lung cancer on 17 July 2004 in Tirana, Albania. After her death, she lay in state in a chapel outside Tirana. She is buried next to her mother-in-law, Queen Geraldine, her husband, Crown Prince Leka, and his father, whose body was reburied in 2012.\n\nSources\n\"Queen Susan of the Albanians (obituary)\".

Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\nHenry Krause\nHenry J. \"Red\" Krause, Jr. (August 28, 1913 \u2013 February 20, 1987) was an American football offensive lineman in the National Football League for the Brooklyn Dodgers and the Washington Redskins.  He played college football at St. Louis University.\nPassage 2:\nCarlo I Cybo-Malaspina\nCarlo I Cybo-Malaspina (18 November 1581 - 13 February 1662) was an Italian nobleman, who was prince of Massa and marquis of Carrara from 1623 until his death.\nBorn in Ferrara, he was the son of Alderano Cybo-Malaspina and Marfisa d'Este. He was also Duke of Ferentillo and held other patrician positions in several of the numerous Italian states of the time. In 1605, he married the Genoese noblewoman Brigida Spinola, from whom he had numerous children.\nThe eldest of them, Alberico, succeeded him after his death in 1662.\nPassage 3:\nAbd al-Muttalib\nShayba ibn H\u0101shim (Arabic: \u0634\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0628\u064e\u0629 \u0625\u0628\u0652\u0646 \u0647\u064e\u0627\u0634\u0650\u0645; c.\u2009497\u2013578), better known as \u02bfAbd al-Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib, (Arabic: \u0639\u064e\u0628\u0652\u062f \u0671\u0644\u0652\u0645\u064f\u0637\u064e\u0651\u0644\u0650\u0628, lit.\u2009'Servant of Muttalib') was the fourth chief of the Quraysh tribal confederation. He was the grandfather of the Islamic prophet Muhammad.\n\nEarly life\nHis father was Hashim ibn 'Abd Manaf,:\u200a81\u200a the progenitor of the distinguished Banu Hashim, a clan of the Quraysh tribe of Mecca. They claimed descent from Ism\u0101'\u012bl and Ibr\u0101h\u012bm. His mother was Salma bint Amr, from the Banu Najjar, a clan of the Khazraj tribe in Yathrib (later called Madinah). Hashim died while doing business in Gaza, before Abd al-Muttalib was born.:\u200a81\u200aHis real name was \"Shaiba\" meaning 'the ancient one' or 'white-haired' because of the streak of white through his jet-black hair, and is sometimes also called Shaybah al-\u1e24amd (\"The white streak of praise\").:\u200a81\u201382\u200a After his father's death he was raised in Yathrib with his mother and her family until about the age of eight, when his uncle Muttalib ibn Abd Manaf went to see him and asked his mother Salmah to entrust Shaybah to his care. Salmah was unwilling to let her son go and Shaiba refused to leave his mother without her consent. Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib then pointed out that the possibilities Yathrib had to offer were incomparable to Mecca. Salmah was impressed with his arguments, so she agreed to let him go. Upon first arriving in Mecca, the people assumed the unknown child was Muttalib's servant and started calling him 'Abd al-Muttalib (\"servant of Muttalib\").:\u200a85\u201386\n\nChieftain of Hashim clan\nWhen Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib died, Shaiba succeeded him as the chief of the H\u0101shim clan. Following his uncle Al-Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib, he took over the duties of providing the pilgrims with food and water, and carried on the practices of his forefathers with his people. He attained such eminence as none of his forefathers enjoyed; his people loved him and his reputation was great among them.:\u200a61\u200a\n'Umar ibn Al-Kha\u1e6d\u1e6d\u0101b's grandfather Nufayl ibn Abdul Uzza arbitrated in a dispute between 'Abdul-Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib and \u1e24arb ibn Umayyah, Abu Sufyan's father, over the custodianship of the Kaaba. Nufayl gave his verdict in favour of 'Abdul-Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib. Addressing \u1e24arb ibn Umayyah, he said:\nWhy do you pick a quarrel with a person who is taller than you in stature; more imposing than you in appearance; more refined than you in intellect; whose progeny outnumbers yours and whose generosity outshines yours in lustre? Do not, however, construe this into any disparagement of your good qualities which I highly appreciate. You are as gentle as a lamb, you are renowned throughout Arabia for the stentorian tones of your voice, and you are an asset to your tribe.\n\nDiscovery of Zam Zam Well\n'Abdul-Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib said that while sleeping in the sacred enclosure, he had dreamed he was ordered to dig at the worship place of the Quraysh between the two deities Is\u0101f and N\u0101'ila. There he would find the Zamzam Well, which the Jurhum tribe had filled in when they left Mecca. The Quraysh tried to stop him digging in that spot, but his son Al-\u1e24\u0101rith stood guard until they gave up their protests. After three days of digging, 'Abdul-Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib found traces of an ancient religious well and exclaimed, \"Allahuakbar!\" Some of the Quraysh disputed his claim to sole rights over water, then one of them suggested that they go to a female shaman who lived afar. It was said that she could summon jinns and that she could help them decide who was the owner of the well. So, 11 people from the 11 tribes went on the expedition. They had to cross the desert to meet the priestess but then they got lost. There was a lack of food and water and people started to lose hope of ever getting out. One of them suggested that they dig their own graves and if they died, the last person standing would bury the others. So all began digging their own graves and just as Abdul-Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib started digging, water spewed out from the hole he dug and everyone became overjoyed. It was then and there decided that Abdul-Muttalib was the owner of the Zam Zam well. Thereafter he supplied pilgrims to the Kaaba with Zam Zam water, which soon eclipsed all the other wells in Mecca because it was considered sacred.:\u200a86\u201389\u200a:\u200a62\u201365\n\nThe Year of the Elephant\nAccording to Muslim tradition, the Ethiopian governor of Yemen, Abrahah al-Ashram, envied the Kaaba's reverence among the Arabs and, being a Christian, he built a cathedral on Sana'a and ordered pilgrimage be made there.:\u200a21\u200a The order was ignored and someone desecrated (some saying in the form of defecation:\u200a696 note 35\u200a) the cathedral. Abrahah decided to avenge this act by demolishing the Kaaba and he advanced with an army towards Mecca.:\u200a22\u201323\u200aThere were thirteen elephants in Abrahah's army:\u200a99\u200a:\u200a26\u200a and the year came to be known as '\u0100m al-F\u012bl (the Year of the Elephant), beginning a trend for reckoning the years in Arabia which was used until 'Umar ibn Al-Kha\u1e6d\u1e6d\u0101b replaced it with the Islamic Calendar in 638 CE (17 AH), with the first year of the Islamic Calendar being 622 CE.\nWhen news of the advance of Abrahah's army came, the Arab tribes of Quraysh, Kin\u0101nah, Khuz\u0101'ah and Hudhayl united in defence of the Kaaba. A man from the \u1e24imyar tribe was sent by Abrahah to advise them that he only wished to demolish the Kaaba and if they resisted, they would be crushed. \"Abdul-Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib told the Meccans to seek refuge in the nearest high hills while he, with some leading members of Quraysh, remained within the precincts of the Kaaba. Abrahah sent a dispatch inviting 'Abdul-Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib to meet him and discuss matters. When 'Abdul-Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib left the meeting he was heard saying, \"The Owner of this House is its Defender, and I am sure He will save it from the attack of the adversaries and will not dishonour the servants of His House.\":\u200a24\u201326\u200aIt is recorded that when Abrahah's forces neared the Kaaba, Allah commanded small birds (ab\u0101b\u012bl) to destroy Abrahah's army, raining down pebbles on it from their beaks. Abrahah was seriously wounded and retreated towards Yemen but died on the way.:\u200a26\u201327\u200a This event is referred to in the following Qur'anic chapter:\n\nHave you not seen how your Lord dealt with the owners of the Elephant?\nDid He not make their treacherous plan go astray?\n\nAnd He sent against them birds in flocks, striking them with stones of baked clay, so He rendered them like straw eaten up.\nMost Islamic sources place the event around the year that Muhammad was born, 570 CE, though other scholars place it one or two decades earlier. A tradition attributed to Ibn Shihab al-Zuhri in the musannaf of \u02bdAbd al-Razzaq al-San\u02bdani places it before the birth of Muhammad's father.\n\nSacrificing his son Abdullah\nAl-Harith was 'Abdul-Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib's only son at the time he dug the Zamzam Well.:\u200a64\u200a When the Quraysh tried to help him in the digging, he vowed that if he were to have ten sons to protect him, he would sacrifice one of them to Allah at the Kaaba. Later, after nine more sons had been born to him, he told them he must keep the vow. The divination arrows fell upon his favourite son Abdullah. The Quraysh protested 'Abdul-Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib's intention to sacrifice his son and demanded that he sacrifice something else instead. 'Abdul-Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib agreed to consult a \"sorceress with a familiar spirit\". She told him to cast lots between Abdullah and ten camels. If Abdullah were chosen, he had to add ten more camels, and keep on doing the same until his Lord accepted the camels in Abdullah's place. When the number of camels reached 100, the lot fell on the camels. 'Abdul-Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib confirmed this by repeating the test three times. Then the camels were sacrificed, and Abdullah was spared.:\u200a66\u201368\n\nFamily\nWives\nAbd al-Muttalib had six known wives.\n\nSumra bint Jundab of the Hawazin tribe.\nLubn\u0101 bint H\u0101jar of the Khuza'a tribe.\nFatima bint Amr of the Makhzum clan of the Quraysh tribe.\nHalah bint Wuhayb of the Zuhrah clan of the Quraysh tribe.\nNat\u012bla bint Janab of the Namir tribe.\nMumanna'a bint Amr of the Khuza'a tribe.\n\nChildren\nAccording to Ibn Hisham, \u02bfAbd al-Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib had ten sons and six daughters.:\u200a707\u2013708 note 97\u200a However, Ibn Sa'd lists twelve sons.:\u200a99\u2013101\u200aBy Sumra bint Jundab:\n\nAl-\u1e24\u0101rith.:\u200a708\u200a He was the firstborn and he died before his father.:\u200a99\u200a\nQuthum.:\u200a100\u200a He is not listed by Ibn Hisham.By Fatima bint Amr:\n\nAl-Zubayr.:\u200a707\u200a He was a poet and a chief; his father made a will in his favour.:\u200a99\u200a He died before Islam, leaving two sons and daughters.:\u200a101\u200a:\u200a34\u201335\u200a\nAbu Talib, born as Abd Manaf,:\u200a99\u200a:\u200a707\u200a father of the future Caliph Ali.

So, Muhammad, Amina, Abd al-Muttalib and their caretaker, Umm Ayman started their journey to Medina, which is around 500 kilometres away from Makkah. They stayed there for three weeks, then, started their journey back to Mecca. But, when they reached halfway, at Al-Abwa', Amina became very sick and died six years after her husband's death. She was buried over there. From then, Muhammad became an orphan. Abd al-Muttalib became very sad for Muhammad because he loved him so much. Abd al-Muttalib took care of Muhammad.

Bartholomew Westley and Ann Colley, daughter of Sir Henry Colley of Carbery Castle in County Kildare, Ireland. He was educated at Dorchester Grammar School and as a student of New Inn Hall, Oxford, where he matriculated on 23 April 1651, and graduated B.A. on 23 January 1655, and M.A. on 4 July 1657. After his appointment as an evangelist, he preached at Melcombe Regis, Radipole, and other areas in Dorset. Never episcopally ordained, he was approved by Oliver Cromwell's Commission of Triers in 1658 and appointed Vicar of Winterborne Whitechurch.The report of his interview in 1661 with Gilbert Ironside the elder, his diocesan, according to Alexander Gordon writing in the Dictionary of National Biography, shows him to have been an Independent. He was imprisoned for not using the Book of Common Prayer, imprisoned again and ejected in 1662. After the Conventicle Act 1664 he continued to preach in small gatherings at Preston and then Poole, until his death at Preston in 1678.\n\nFamily\nHe married a daughter of John White, who was related also to Thomas Fuller. White, the \"Patriarch of Dorchester\", married a sister of Cornelius Burges. Westley's eldest son was Timothy (born 1659). Their second son was Rev.

He was the grandfather of singer/poet Leonard Cohen.\n\nBiography\nCohen was born in Congress Poland, part of the Russian Empire, to a Jewish family on May 11, 1868. He immigrated to Canada with his parents in 1871. He was educated at the McGill Model School and the Catholic Commercial Academy in Montreal. In 1888, he entered the firm of Lee & Cohen in Montreal; later became partner with his father in the firm of L. Cohen & Son; in 1895, he established W. R.

The Freedman Company went on to become one of Montreal\u2019s largest clothing companies.In 1897, Cohen and Samuel William Jacobs founded the Canadian Jewish Times, the first English-language Jewish newspaper in Canada. The newspaper promoted the Canadianization of recent East European Jewish immigrants and encouraged their acceptance of Canadian customs as Cohen felt that the old world customs of immigrant Jews were one of the main causes of anti-Semitism. In 1914, the paper was purchased by Hirsch Wolofsky, owner of the Yiddish-language Keneder Adler, who transformed it into the Canadian Jewish Chronicle.He died on August 17, 1937, at the age of 69.\n\nPhilanthropy\nCohen was elected the first president of the Canadian Jewish Congress in 1919 and organized the Jewish Immigrant Aid Services of Canada.

She was the illegitimate daughter of Francesco d'Este and Maria Folch de Cardona. She and her sister Bradamante (born 1559) were legitimised by both pope Gregory XIII and Alfonso II d'Este.

He was the grandfather of the Islamic prophet Muhammad.\n\nEarly life\nHis father was Hashim ibn 'Abd Manaf,:\u200a81\u200a the progenitor of the distinguished Banu Hashim, a clan of the Quraysh tribe of Mecca. They claimed descent from Ism\u0101'\u012bl and Ibr\u0101h\u012bm. His mother was Salma bint Amr, from the Banu Najjar, a clan of the Khazraj tribe in Yathrib (later called Madinah). Hashim died while doing business in Gaza, before Abd al-Muttalib was born.:\u200a81\u200aHis real name was \"Shaiba\" meaning 'the ancient one' or 'white-haired' because of the streak of white through his jet-black hair, and is sometimes also called Shaybah al-\u1e24amd (\"The white streak of praise\").:\u200a81\u201382\u200a After his father's death he was raised in Yathrib with his mother and her family until about the age of eight, when his uncle Muttalib ibn Abd Manaf went to see him and asked his mother Salmah to entrust Shaybah to his care. Salmah was unwilling to let her son go and Shaiba refused to leave his mother without her consent. Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib then pointed out that the possibilities Yathrib had to offer were incomparable to Mecca. Salmah was impressed with his arguments, so she agreed to let him go. Upon first arriving in Mecca, the people assumed the unknown child was Muttalib's servant and started calling him 'Abd al-Muttalib (\"servant of Muttalib\").:\u200a85\u201386\n\nChieftain of Hashim clan\nWhen Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib died, Shaiba succeeded him as the chief of the H\u0101shim clan. Following his uncle Al-Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib, he took over the duties of providing the pilgrims with food and water, and carried on the practices of his forefathers with his people. He attained such eminence as none of his forefathers enjoyed; his people loved him and his reputation was great among them.:\u200a61\u200a\n'Umar ibn Al-Kha\u1e6d\u1e6d\u0101b's grandfather Nufayl ibn Abdul Uzza arbitrated in a dispute between 'Abdul-Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib and \u1e24arb ibn Umayyah, Abu Sufyan's father, over the custodianship of the Kaaba. Nufayl gave his verdict in favour of 'Abdul-Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib. Addressing \u1e24arb ibn Umayyah, he said:\nWhy do you pick a quarrel with a person who is taller than you in stature; more imposing than you in appearance; more refined than you in intellect; whose progeny outnumbers yours and whose generosity outshines yours in lustre? Do not, however, construe this into any disparagement of your good qualities which I highly appreciate. You are as gentle as a lamb, you are renowned throughout Arabia for the stentorian tones of your voice, and you are an asset to your tribe.\n\nDiscovery of Zam Zam Well\n'Abdul-Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib said that while sleeping in the sacred enclosure, he had dreamed he was ordered to dig at the worship place of the Quraysh between the two deities Is\u0101f and N\u0101'ila. There he would find the Zamzam Well, which the Jurhum tribe had filled in when they left Mecca. The Quraysh tried to stop him digging in that spot, but his son Al-\u1e24\u0101rith stood guard until they gave up their protests. After three days of digging, 'Abdul-Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib found traces of an ancient religious well and exclaimed, \"Allahuakbar!\" Some of the Quraysh disputed his claim to sole rights over water, then one of them suggested that they go to a female shaman who lived afar. It was said that she could summon jinns and that she could help them decide who was the owner of the well. So, 11 people from the 11 tribes went on the expedition. They had to cross the desert to meet the priestess but then they got lost. There was a lack of food and water and people started to lose hope of ever getting out. One of them suggested that they dig their own graves and if they died, the last person standing would bury the others. So all began digging their own graves and just as Abdul-Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib started digging, water spewed out from the hole he dug and everyone became overjoyed. It was then and there decided that Abdul-Muttalib was the owner of the Zam Zam well. Thereafter he supplied pilgrims to the Kaaba with Zam Zam water, which soon eclipsed all the other wells in Mecca because it was considered sacred.:\u200a86\u201389\u200a:\u200a62\u201365\n\nThe Year of the Elephant\nAccording to Muslim tradition, the Ethiopian governor of Yemen, Abrahah al-Ashram, envied the Kaaba's reverence among the Arabs and, being a Christian, he built a cathedral on Sana'a and ordered pilgrimage be made there.:\u200a21\u200a The order was ignored and someone desecrated (some saying in the form of defecation:\u200a696 note 35\u200a) the cathedral. Abrahah decided to avenge this act by demolishing the Kaaba and he advanced with an army towards Mecca.:\u200a22\u201323\u200aThere were thirteen elephants in Abrahah's army:\u200a99\u200a:\u200a26\u200a and the year came to be known as '\u0100m al-F\u012bl (the Year of the Elephant), beginning a trend for reckoning the years in Arabia which was used until 'Umar ibn Al-Kha\u1e6d\u1e6d\u0101b replaced it with the Islamic Calendar in 638 CE (17 AH), with the first year of the Islamic Calendar being 622 CE.\nWhen news of the advance of Abrahah's army came, the Arab tribes of Quraysh, Kin\u0101nah, Khuz\u0101'ah and Hudhayl united in defence of the Kaaba. A man from the \u1e24imyar tribe was sent by Abrahah to advise them that he only wished to demolish the Kaaba and if they resisted, they would be crushed. \"Abdul-Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib told the Meccans to seek refuge in the nearest high hills while he, with some leading members of Quraysh, remained within the precincts of the Kaaba. Abrahah sent a dispatch inviting 'Abdul-Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib to meet him and discuss matters. When 'Abdul-Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib left the meeting he was heard saying, \"The Owner of this House is its Defender, and I am sure He will save it from the attack of the adversaries and will not dishonour the servants of His House.\":\u200a24\u201326\u200aIt is recorded that when Abrahah's forces neared the Kaaba, Allah commanded small birds (ab\u0101b\u012bl) to destroy Abrahah's army, raining down pebbles on it from their beaks. Abrahah was seriously wounded and retreated towards Yemen but died on the way.:\u200a26\u201327\u200a This event is referred to in the following Qur'anic chapter:\n\nHave you not seen how your Lord dealt with the owners of the Elephant?\nDid He not make their treacherous plan go astray?\n\nAnd He sent against them birds in flocks, striking them with stones of baked clay, so He rendered them like straw eaten up.\nMost Islamic sources place the event around the year that Muhammad was born, 570 CE, though other scholars place it one or two decades earlier. A tradition attributed to Ibn Shihab al-Zuhri in the musannaf of \u02bdAbd al-Razzaq al-San\u02bdani places it before the birth of Muhammad's father.\n\nSacrificing his son Abdullah\nAl-Harith was 'Abdul-Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib's only son at the time he dug the Zamzam Well.:\u200a64\u200a When the Quraysh tried to help him in the digging, he vowed that if he were to have ten sons to protect him, he would sacrifice one of them to Allah at the Kaaba. Later, after nine more sons had been born to him, he told them he must keep the vow. The divination arrows fell upon his favourite son Abdullah. The Quraysh protested 'Abdul-Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib's intention to sacrifice his son and demanded that he sacrifice something else instead. 'Abdul-Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib agreed to consult a \"sorceress with a familiar spirit\". She told him to cast lots between Abdullah and ten camels. If Abdullah were chosen, he had to add ten more camels, and keep on doing the same until his Lord accepted the camels in Abdullah's place. When the number of camels reached 100, the lot fell on the camels. 'Abdul-Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib confirmed this by repeating the test three times. Then the camels were sacrificed, and Abdullah was spared.:\u200a66\u201368\n\nFamily\nWives\nAbd al-Muttalib had six known wives.\n\nSumra bint Jundab of the Hawazin tribe.\nLubn\u0101 bint H\u0101jar of the Khuza'a tribe.\nFatima bint Amr of the Makhzum clan of the Quraysh tribe.\nHalah bint Wuhayb of the Zuhrah clan of the Quraysh tribe.\nNat\u012bla bint Janab of the Namir tribe.\nMumanna'a bint Amr of the Khuza'a tribe.\n\nChildren\nAccording to Ibn Hisham, \u02bfAbd al-Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib had ten sons and six daughters.:\u200a707\u2013708 note 97\u200a However, Ibn Sa'd lists twelve sons.:\u200a99\u2013101\u200aBy Sumra bint Jundab:\n\nAl-\u1e24\u0101rith.:\u200a708\u200a He was the firstborn and he died before his father.:\u200a99\u200a\nQuthum.:\u200a100\u200a He is not listed by Ibn Hisham.By Fatima bint Amr:\n\nAl-Zubayr.:\u200a707\u200a He was a poet and a chief; his father made a will in his favour.:\u200a99\u200a He died before Islam, leaving two sons and daughters.:\u200a101\u200a:\u200a34\u201335\u200a\nAbu Talib, born as Abd Manaf,:\u200a99\u200a:\u200a707\u200a father of the future Caliph Ali.

The striking cinematography, filmed in garish Eastmancolor, is by the award-winning Tonino Delli Colli who has lensed such art house classics as Pasolini's The Gospel According to St. Matthew (1964), Marco Bellocchio's China Is Near (1967), and Sergio Leone's Once Upon a Time in the West (1968). And the amusing, Ravel-inspired score by Franco Mannino strikes the perfect mock-epic tone. Among the more memorable set pieces are an exotic voodoo dance performed by Cuban sex bomb Chelo Alonso (a former dancer at the Folies Berg\u00e8re in Paris), a battle at sea in which Morgan's men, disguised as women, storm a Spanish galleon in full drag, and the bloody, climactic sacking of Panama with shootings, stabbings and explosions galore.\"\nPassage 5:\nPrem Mhanje Prem Mhanje Prem Asta\nPrem Mhanje Prem Mhanje Prem Asta (Marathi: \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0947\u092e \u092e\u094d\u0939\u0923\u091c\u0947 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0947\u092e \u092e\u094d\u0939\u0923\u091c\u0947 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0947\u092e \u0905\u0938\u0924\u0902) is a Marathi drama film released on 19 April 2013.

On his forays he hijacks ships and kidnaps the women captured on the ships in order to later sell them as slaves to Turkish human traffickers in North Africa. The rogue pirate only becomes weak when it comes to one woman: the glow-eyed princess Miriam, ruler of a desert tribe of Arabs. One day, Drakut makes a crucial mistake when he raids the \"San Luca\" and kidnaps Bianca, who is traveling with him. She is the daughter of the governor of Rhodes, which currently belongs to the Republic of Venice. There were also several secret papers from the Doge of Venice on board. The governor is in dire need, as he has to assume that his Bianca could also be bartered away to some lecherous Arab despot. But he is lucky in his misfortune, because a certain Roberto Diego, a notorious adventurer and son of the once feared \"Red Corsair\", offers his father his help.  \nDiego has just been sentenced to incarceration because of high debts, but is willing to risk his life to save the beautiful little daughter and the secret documents for the good of Bianca and the Doge of Venice if his sentence is released. However, the governor has no idea that Roberto has very personal motives for bringing himself up as a rescuer and liberator. Because Roberto still has a score to settle with Drakut: He was once responsible for the death of Roberto's father. The governor agrees to this bargain, and Diego joins Drakut's crew on board. In the Catalan painter Francesco he found his only ally. As a newcomer on board, Roberto has to be very careful because people are very suspicious of him. When he tries to flirt with Bianca, Drakut's right hand man, the brutal Gamal, notices and flogs the Red Corsair's son. Soon, the general emotional chaos puts the whole rescue operation in danger, because Roberto falls in love with Drakut's hostage Bianca, while Miriam, the pirate captain's lover, falls in love with Roberto.     \nArriving on North Africa's shores, Drakut travels on to an oasis. Miriam is the sole ruler here so far. Drakut, who once owed her his life, also has other reasons for being on good terms with Miriam, since he hopes to rule over her desert kingdom one day. In order to get rid of the annoying competitor for the favor of the exotic beauty, Drakut uses an opportunity to let Roberto die of thirst on the way to the oasis. But he is brave and tough enough to fight his way through to the saving goal. Diego begins to play a double game: on the one hand he loves the kidnapped Bianca, but he also keeps Miriam warm because he needs her help for his plan to finally put an end to Drakut.  In fact, Roberto's battle plan succeeds: he can save the kidnapped girls from the hands of greedy Turkish slave traders, wins Bianca's heart en passant and achieves that Drakut sinks in the sea with his pirate ship, which is set on fire, together with Miriam, who was killed in battle.\n\nCast\nLex Barker as The Dragon Drakut\nChelo Alonso as Princess Miriam\nMassimo Serato as Roberto Diego\nGraziella Granata as  Bianca\nLuigi Tosi  as Francisco\nBruno Corelli as  Selim\nMichele Malaspina as Gouvernor of Rhodes\nAnna Arena as  Zaira\nEnzo Maggio as  Candela\nDaniele Vargas as  Gamal\nFranco Fantasia as  Captain Volan\nIgnazio Balsamo\nUbaldo Lay\nGianni Rizzo\nUgo Sasso\nErminio Spalla\nAmedeo Trilli\nPassage 9:\nThe Wonderful World of Captain Kuhio\nThe Wonderful World of Captain Kuhio (\u30af\u30d2\u30aa\u5927\u4f50, Kuhio Taisa, lit. \"Captain Kuhio\") is a 2009 Japanese comedy-crime film, directed by Daihachi Yoshida, based on Kazumasa Yoshida's 2006 biographical novel, Kekkon Sagishi Kuhio Taisa (lit. \"Marriage swindler Captain Kuhio\"), that focuses on a real-life marriage swindler, who conned over 100 million yen (US$1.2 million) from a number of women between the 1970s and the 1990s.The film was released in Japan on 10 October 2009.\n\nCast\nMasato Sakai - Captain Kuhio\nYasuko Matsuyuki - Shinobu Nagano\nHikari Mitsushima - Haru Yasuoka\nYuko Nakamura - Michiko Sudo\nHirofumi Arai - Tatsuya Nagano\nKazuya Kojima - Koichi Takahashi\nSakura Ando - Rika Kinoshita\nMasaaki Uchino - Chief Fujiwara\nKanji Furutachi - Shigeru Kuroda\nReila Aphrodite\nSei Ando\n\nAwards\nAt the 31st Yokohama Film Festival\nBest Actor \u2013 Masato Sakai\nBest Supporting Actress \u2013 Sakura Ando\nPassage 10:\nTPB AFK\nTPB AFK: The Pirate Bay Away From Keyboard is a 2013 Swedish documentary film directed and produced by Simon Klose.

Morgan falls in love with his mistress, much to the dismay of her father, who punishes him by sentencing him to a life of hard labor aboard a Spanish galleon. \nMorgan leads his fellow slaves in mutiny, takes command of the ship, and becomes a pirate, without knowing that Do\u00f1a Inez was on board, on her way to Spain. She becomes his prisoner, but spurns him when he declares his love in Tortuga. Not long after, Morgan's daring exploits on the Spanish Main pique the interest of King Charles II of England, and Morgan agrees to attack only Spanish vessels in return for English ships and men. \nFearing for the security of Do\u00f1a Inez, after the pirates discover her identity, he permits her to return to Panama. Once there, she warns Don Jos\u00e9 of Morgan's planned invasion, and the pirate ships are either easily sunk or routed by the alerted Spanish. Not giving up, Morgan leads his men overland and attacks the city from the rear.

The striking cinematography, filmed in garish Eastmancolor, is by the award-winning Tonino Delli Colli who has lensed such art house classics as Pasolini's The Gospel According to St. Matthew (1964), Marco Bellocchio's China Is Near (1967), and Sergio Leone's Once Upon a Time in the West (1968). And the amusing, Ravel-inspired score by Franco Mannino strikes the perfect mock-epic tone. Among the more memorable set pieces are an exotic voodoo dance performed by Cuban sex bomb Chelo Alonso (a former dancer at the Folies Berg\u00e8re in Paris), a battle at sea in which Morgan's men, disguised as women, storm a Spanish galleon in full drag, and the bloody, climactic sacking of Panama with shootings, stabbings and explosions galore.\"\nPassage 5:\nPrem Mhanje Prem Mhanje Prem Asta\nPrem Mhanje Prem Mhanje Prem Asta (Marathi: \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0947\u092e \u092e\u094d\u0939\u0923\u091c\u0947 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0947\u092e \u092e\u094d\u0939\u0923\u091c\u0947 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0947\u092e \u0905\u0938\u0924\u0902) is a Marathi drama film released on 19 April 2013.

She is happy in this life and only in dreams remembers dimly another existence.\nOne night she aids the gang in robbing the Hawthorne home, and at the sight of the familiar rooms she is puzzled but still unable to remember.\nIn the meantime, her mother, overcome by remorse after her child is lost, gives up her frivolous diversions and devotes her time to charity. Her father, on the contrary, becomes the owner of a notorious caf\u00e9 which he manages through Kraft. One day Kraft meets Millicent and offers her a position as a dancer. The first evening she dances Mrs. Hawthorne, on a tour of investigation, enters the place and is saddened at conditions.\n\nThat evening Mrs. Hawthorne learns who really owns the caf\u00e9, and begs her husband to give it up, telling him of the pathetic little dancer she saw there.

On his forays he hijacks ships and kidnaps the women captured on the ships in order to later sell them as slaves to Turkish human traffickers in North Africa. The rogue pirate only becomes weak when it comes to one woman: the glow-eyed princess Miriam, ruler of a desert tribe of Arabs. One day, Drakut makes a crucial mistake when he raids the \"San Luca\" and kidnaps Bianca, who is traveling with him. She is the daughter of the governor of Rhodes, which currently belongs to the Republic of Venice. There were also several secret papers from the Doge of Venice on board. The governor is in dire need, as he has to assume that his Bianca could also be bartered away to some lecherous Arab despot. But he is lucky in his misfortune, because a certain Roberto Diego, a notorious adventurer and son of the once feared \"Red Corsair\", offers his father his help.  \nDiego has just been sentenced to incarceration because of high debts, but is willing to risk his life to save the beautiful little daughter and the secret documents for the good of Bianca and the Doge of Venice if his sentence is released. However, the governor has no idea that Roberto has very personal motives for bringing himself up as a rescuer and liberator. Because Roberto still has a score to settle with Drakut: He was once responsible for the death of Roberto's father. The governor agrees to this bargain, and Diego joins Drakut's crew on board. In the Catalan painter Francesco he found his only ally. As a newcomer on board, Roberto has to be very careful because people are very suspicious of him. When he tries to flirt with Bianca, Drakut's right hand man, the brutal Gamal, notices and flogs the Red Corsair's son. Soon, the general emotional chaos puts the whole rescue operation in danger, because Roberto falls in love with Drakut's hostage Bianca, while Miriam, the pirate captain's lover, falls in love with Roberto.     \nArriving on North Africa's shores, Drakut travels on to an oasis. Miriam is the sole ruler here so far. Drakut, who once owed her his life, also has other reasons for being on good terms with Miriam, since he hopes to rule over her desert kingdom one day. In order to get rid of the annoying competitor for the favor of the exotic beauty, Drakut uses an opportunity to let Roberto die of thirst on the way to the oasis. But he is brave and tough enough to fight his way through to the saving goal. Diego begins to play a double game: on the one hand he loves the kidnapped Bianca, but he also keeps Miriam warm because he needs her help for his plan to finally put an end to Drakut.  In fact, Roberto's battle plan succeeds: he can save the kidnapped girls from the hands of greedy Turkish slave traders, wins Bianca's heart en passant and achieves that Drakut sinks in the sea with his pirate ship, which is set on fire, together with Miriam, who was killed in battle.\n\nCast\nLex Barker as The Dragon Drakut\nChelo Alonso as Princess Miriam\nMassimo Serato as Roberto Diego\nGraziella Granata as  Bianca\nLuigi Tosi  as Francisco\nBruno Corelli as  Selim\nMichele Malaspina as Gouvernor of Rhodes\nAnna Arena as  Zaira\nEnzo Maggio as  Candela\nDaniele Vargas as  Gamal\nFranco Fantasia as  Captain Volan\nIgnazio Balsamo\nUbaldo Lay\nGianni Rizzo\nUgo Sasso\nErminio Spalla\nAmedeo Trilli\nPassage 9:\nThe Wonderful World of Captain Kuhio\nThe Wonderful World of Captain Kuhio (\u30af\u30d2\u30aa\u5927\u4f50, Kuhio Taisa, lit. \"Captain Kuhio\") is a 2009 Japanese comedy-crime film, directed by Daihachi Yoshida, based on Kazumasa Yoshida's 2006 biographical novel, Kekkon Sagishi Kuhio Taisa (lit. \"Marriage swindler Captain Kuhio\"), that focuses on a real-life marriage swindler, who conned over 100 million yen (US$1.2 million) from a number of women between the 1970s and the 1990s.The film was released in Japan on 10 October 2009.\n\nCast\nMasato Sakai - Captain Kuhio\nYasuko Matsuyuki - Shinobu Nagano\nHikari Mitsushima - Haru Yasuoka\nYuko Nakamura - Michiko Sudo\nHirofumi Arai - Tatsuya Nagano\nKazuya Kojima - Koichi Takahashi\nSakura Ando - Rika Kinoshita\nMasaaki Uchino - Chief Fujiwara\nKanji Furutachi - Shigeru Kuroda\nReila Aphrodite\nSei Ando\n\nAwards\nAt the 31st Yokohama Film Festival\nBest Actor \u2013 Masato Sakai\nBest Supporting Actress \u2013 Sakura Ando\nPassage 10:\nTPB AFK\nTPB AFK: The Pirate Bay Away From Keyboard is a 2013 Swedish documentary film directed and produced by Simon Klose.

{"prompt": "Answer the question based on the given passages. Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\nGaius Julius Aquila\nGaius Julius Aquila was the name of a number of people who lived during the Roman Empire.\n\nPrefect of Egypt\nGaius Julius Aquila was a praefectus of Roman Egypt between 10 CE and 11.\n\nGovernor of Bythinia et Pontus\nGaius Julius Aquila was a Roman knight, stationed with a few cohorts, in 45 CE, to protect Tiberius Julius Cotys I, king of the Bosporan Kingdom, who had received the sovereignty after the expulsion of Tiberius Julius Mithridates. In the same year, Aquila obtained the praetorian insignia. He also erected a monument honouring the emperor Claudius in Asia Minor (modern Turkey) known as the Ku\u015fkayas\u0131 Monument.\nPassage 2:\nMaximus of Tyre\nMaximus of Tyre (Greek: \u039c\u03ac\u03be\u03b9\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 \u03a4\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2; fl. late 2nd century AD), also known as Cassius Maximus Tyrius, was a Greek rhetorician and philosopher who lived in the time of the Antonines and Commodus, and who belongs to the trend of the Second Sophistic.  His writings contain many allusions to the history of Greece, while there is little reference to Rome; hence it is inferred that he lived longer in Greece, perhaps as a professor at Athens. Although nominally a Platonist, he is really a sophist rather than a philosopher, although he is still considered one of the precursors of Neoplatonism.\n\nWritings\nThe Dissertations\nThere exist 41 essays or discourses on theological, ethical, and other philosophical subjects, collected into a work called The Dissertations. The central theme is God as the supreme being, one and indivisible though called by many names, accessible to reason alone:\nIn such a mighty contest, sedition and discord, you will see one according law and assertion in all the earth, that there is one God, the king and father of all things, and many gods, sons of God, ruling together with him.\nAs animals form the intermediate stage between plants and human beings, so there exist intermediaries between God and man, viz. daemons, who dwell on the confines of heaven and earth. The soul in many ways bears a great resemblance to the divinity; it is partly mortal, partly immortal, and, when freed from the fetters of the body, becomes a daemon. Life is the sleep of the soul, from which it awakes at death. The style of Maximus is superior to that of the ordinary sophistical rhetorician, but scholars differ widely as to the merits of the essays themselves.Dissertation XX discusses \"Whether the Life of a Cynic is to Be Preferred\". He begins with a narrative of how Prometheus created mankind, who initially lived a life of ease \"for the earth supplied them with aliment, rich meadows, long-haired mountains, and abundance of fruits\" \u2013 in other words, a Garden of Eden that resonates with Cynic ideas. It was \"a life without war, without iron, without a guard, peaceful, healthful unindigent\".\nThen, taking perhaps from Lucretius, he contrasts that Garden to mankind's \"second life\", which started with the division of the earth into property, which they then enclosed into fortifications and walls, and started to wear jewellery and gold, built houses, \u201cmolested the earth by digging into it for metals\u201d, and invaded the sea and the air (killing animals, fish and birds), in what he described as a \u201cslaughter and all-various gore, pursuing gratification of the body\u201d. Humans became unhappy and, to compensate, sought wealth, \u201cfearing poverty...dreading death...neglecting the care of life...They blamed base actions but did not abstain from them and \u201cthe hated to live, but dreaded to die\u201d.He then contrasts the two lives \u2013 that of the original Garden and of the \u201csecond life\u201d he has just described and asks, which man would not choose the first, who \u201cknows that by the change he shall be liberated from a multitude of evils\u201d and what he calls \u201ca dreadful prison of unhappy men, confined to a dreadful prison of unhappy men, confined in a dark recess, with large iron fetters round their feet, a great weight about their neck\u2026passing their time in filth, in torment, and in weeping\u201d. He asks, \u201cWhich of these images shall we proclaim blessed\u201d? He goes on to praise Diogenes of Sinopeus, the Cynic, for choosing his ascetic life, but only because he avoided the often fearful fates of other philosophers \u2013 such as Socrates being condemned. But there is no mention of he himself taking up the ascetic life himself; rather he only talks about how the Garden would be preferable to the life mankind has made for itself. So it is unlikely he was a Cynic, but was just envious of that idealised pre-civilisation Life in the Garden.Maximus of Tyre must be distinguished from the Stoic Claudius Maximus, tutor of Marcus Aurelius.\n\nAncient Greek Text\nMaximus Tyrius, Philosophumena, Dialexeis - Edited by George Leonidas Koniaris, Publisher Walter de Gruyter, 1995, DOI: https://doi.org/10.1515/9783110882568 - this critical edition presents the Ancient Greek text of Maximus of Tyre.\n\nTranslations\nTaylor, Thomas, The Dissertations of Maximus Tyrius.

Unlike the others songwriters who wrote about the town improvements and mentioned changes to layout, street plans, new buildings etc., Charlton concentrated on the social changes brought about by the work, and sometimes not too kindly.\nThe same song without any comment, except the author's name, appears on page 159 of The Tyne Songster published by W & T Fordyce published in 1840 and on page 151 of A Collection of Songs, Comic, Satirical, and Descriptive published by Thomas Marshall published in 1829\nNothing more appears to be known of this person, or their life, or even their Christian name or sex.\n\nSee also\nGeordie dialect words\n(Geordie) Rhymes of Northern Bards by John Bell Junior\nJohn Bell (folk music)\nPassage 4:\nMubarak Khwaja\nMubarak Khwaja (Kazakh: \u041c\u04af\u0431\u04d9\u0440\u04d9\u043a \u049a\u043e\u0436\u0430, Persian: \u0645\u0628\u0627\u0631\u06a9 \u062e\u0648\u0627\u062c\u0647) was the khan of White Horde in 1320\u20131344.

He lived in Tamsui District, New Taipei City.\n\nBiography\nHe was born Chou Chi-shu in Xichuan County, Henan in 1921. In 1948, Chou joined the China Youth Corps and was forced to drop out of school. He was sent to Taiwan following the defeat of Chiang Kai-shek's army in the Chinese Civil War, leaving his wife, two sons, and daughter behind in Mainland China. He settled in Tamsui District, New Taipei City.\nChou started writing in the Central Daily News and publishing poetry in 1952. He retired from the army in 1955.\nIn 1959, he started selling books outside the Cafe Astoria in Taipei and published his first book of poetry entitled Lonely County. Chou's book stall became a gathering spot for well-known writers, such as Huang Chun-ming, Pai Hsien-yung, and Sanmao. Chou wrote often on the subjects of time, life, and death, and was influenced by Buddhism.In 1980, the American magazine Orientations praised him as the \"Amoy Street Prophet\".  During the same year, he was forced to close his book stall in front of Cafe Astoria due to gastric ulcer surgery. He was the first recipient of the National Culture and Arts Foundation Literature Laureate Award in 1997.Chou died of pneumonia in New Taipei City on May 1, 2014 at the age of 92. His funeral was held twelve days later, with writers and politicians including Chang Show-foong, Lung Ying-tai, Timothy Yang, and Hsiang Ming in attendance.A bilingual selection from Chou's poetry with English translations by Lloyd Haft, Zhou Mengdie: 41 Poems, was published by Azoth Books (Taiwan) in 2022.\nPassage 6:\nZhou Youguang\nZhou Youguang (Chinese: \u5468\u6709\u5149; pinyin: Zh\u014du Y\u01d2ugu\u0101ng; 13 January 1906 \u2013 14 January 2017), also known as Chou Yu-kuang or Chou Yao-ping, was a Chinese economist, banker, linguist, sinologist, Esperantist, publisher, and supercentenarian, known as the \"father of Pinyin\", a system for the writing of Mandarin Chinese in Roman script, or romanization, which was officially adopted by the government of the People's Republic of China in 1958, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in 1982, and the United Nations in 1986.\n\nEarly life and career\nZhou was born Zhou Yaoping in Changzhou (Changchow), Jiangsu Province, on 13 January 1906 to a Qing Dynasty official. At the age of ten, he and his family moved to Suzhou, Jiangsu Province. In 1918, he entered Changzhou High School, during which time he first took an interest in linguistics. He graduated in 1923 with honors.Zhou enrolled that same year in St. John's University, Shanghai where he majored in economics and took supplementary coursework in linguistics. He was almost unable to attend due to his family's poverty, but friends and relatives raised 200 yuan for the admission fee, and also helped him pay for tuition. He left during the May Thirtieth Movement of 1925 and transferred to Guanghua University, from which he graduated in 1927.On 30 April 1933, Zhou married Zhang Yunhe (\u5f20\u5141\u548c). The couple went to Japan for Zhou's studies. Zhou started as an exchange student at the University of Tokyo, later transferring to Kyoto University due to his admiration of the Japanese Marxist economist Hajime Kawakami, who was a professor there at the time. Kawakami's arrest for joining the outlawed Japanese Communist Party in January 1933 meant that Zhou could not be his student. Zhou's son, Zhou Xiaoping (\u5468\u6653\u5e73), was born in 1934. The couple also had a daughter, Zhou Xiaohe (\u5468\u5c0f\u79be).In 1937, due to the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War, Zhou and his family moved to the wartime capital Chongqing, and his daughter died. He worked for  Sin Hua Bank before entering public service as a deputy director at the National Government's Ministry of Economic Affairs, agricultural policy bureau (\u7ecf\u6d4e\u90e8\u519c\u672c\u5c40). After the 1945 Japanese defeat in World War II, Zhou went back to work for Sin Hua where he was stationed overseas: first in New York City and then in London. When he was in New York, he met Albert Einstein twice while visiting friends at Princeton University.Zhou participated for a time in the China Democratic National Construction Association. After the founding of the People's Republic was established in 1949 he returned to Shanghai, where he taught economics at Fudan University for several years.\n\nDesigning Pinyin\nBecause of his friendship with Zhou Enlai who recalled the economist's fascination with linguistics and Esperanto, he summoned Zhou to Beijing in 1955 and tasked his team with developing a new alphabet for China. The Chinese government placed Zhou at the head of a committee to reform the Chinese language to increase literacy. \nWhile other committees oversaw the tasks of promulgating Mandarin Chinese as the national language and creating simplified Chinese characters, Zhou's committee was charged with developing a romanization to represent the pronunciation of Chinese characters. Zhou said the task took about three years, and was a full-time job. Pinyin was made the official romanization in 1958, although (as now) it was only a pronunciation guide, not a substitute writing system. Zhou's team based Pinyin on several preexisting systems: the phonemes were inspired by Gwoyeu Romatzyh of 1928 and Latinxua Sin Wenz of 1931, while the diacritic markings representing tones were inspired by zhuyin.In April 1979, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in Warsaw held a technology conference. Speaking on behalf of the People's Republic of China, Zhou proposed the use of the \"Hanyu Pinyin System\" as the international standard for the romanization of Chinese. Following a vote in 1982 the scheme became ISO 7098.\nIn the modern era Pinyin has largely replaced older romanization systems such as Wade-Giles.\n\nLater activities\nDuring the Cultural Revolution, Zhou was sent to live in the countryside and to be \"reeducated\", as were many other intellectuals at that time. He spent two years at a labor camp.After 1980, Zhou worked with Liu Zunqi and Chien Wei-zang on translating the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica into Chinese, earning him the nickname \"Encyclopedia Zhou\". Zhou continued writing and publishing after the creation of Pinyin; for example, his book \u4e2d\u56fd\u8bed\u6587\u7684\u65f6\u4ee3\u6f14\u8fdb (Zh\u014dnggu\u00f3 y\u01d4w\u00e9n de sh\u00edd\u00e0i y\u01cenj\u00ecn), translated into English by Zhang Liqing, was published in 2003 as The Historical Evolution of Chinese Languages and Scripts. Beyond the age of 100, he published ten books, some of which have been banned in China.In 2011, during an interview with NPR, Zhou said that he hoped to see the day China changed its position on the Tiananmen Square killings in 1989, an event he said had ruined Deng Xiaoping's reputation as a reformer. He became an advocate of political reform and democracy in China, and was critical of the Communist Party of China's attacks on traditional Chinese culture when it came into power.In early 2013, both Zhou and his son were interviewed by Dr. Adeline Yen Mah at their residence in Beijing. Mah documented the visit in a video and presented Zhou with a Pinyin game she created for the iPad. Zhou became a supercentenarian on 13 January 2016 when he reached the age of 110.Zhou died on 14 January 2017 at his home in Beijing, one day after his 111th birthday; no cause was given. His wife had died in 2002, and his son had died in 2015.Google honored what would have been his 112th birthday with an animated version of its logo in Mandarin.\n\nBooks\nZhou was the author of more than 40 books, some of them banned in China and over 10 of them published after he turned 100 in 2006.\n\nGallery\nSee also\nYuen Ren Chao\nList of centenarians (educators, school administrators, social scientists and linguists)\nPassage 7:\nFredy Schmidtke\nFredy Schmidtke (1 July 1961 \u2013 1 December 2017) was a German track cyclist.

He was re-elected to the Assembly in 1956 and remained a member until his death. Previously, Frank had been a member of the Outagamie County Board from 1930 to 1936. He was a Republican.\nPassage 9:\nZou Yixin\nZou Yixin or Chou Yi-Hsin (1911\u20131997) was a Chinese astronomer, who has been called \"the first female astronomer in China\".\nPassage 10:\nJustin (historian)\nJustin (Latin: Marcus Junianus Justinus Frontinus; fl. c.\u20092nd century) was a Latin writer and historian who lived under the  Roman Empire.\n\nLife\nAlmost nothing is known of Justin's personal history, his name appearing only in the title of his work. He must have lived after Gnaeus Pompeius Trogus, whose work he excerpted, and his references to the Romans and Parthians' having divided the world between themselves would have been anachronistic after the rise of the Sassanians in the third century. His Latin appears to be consistent with the style of the second century. Ronald Syme, however, argues for a date around AD 390, immediately before the compilation of the Augustan History, and dismisses anachronisms and the archaic style as unimportant, as he asserts readers would have understood Justin's phrasing to represent Trogus' time, and not his own.\n\nWorks\nJustin was the author of an epitome of Trogus' expansive Liber Historiarum Philippicarum, or Philippic Histories, a history of the kings of Macedonia, compiled in the time of Augustus.  Due to its numerous digressions, this work was retitled by one of its editors, Historia Philippicae et Totius Mundi Origines et Terrae Situs, or Philippic History and Origins of the Entire World and All of its Lands.  Justin's preface explains that he aimed to collect the most important and interesting passages of that work, which has since been lost.  Some of Trogus' original arguments (prologi) are preserved in various other authors, such as Pliny the Elder.  Trogus' main theme was the rise and history of the Macedonian Empire, and like him, Justin permitted himself considerable freedom of digression, producing an idiosyncratic anthology rather than a strict epitome.\n\nLegacy\nJustin's history was much used in the Middle Ages, when its author was sometimes mistakenly conflated with Justin Martyr.\n\nNotes\n\nAnswer the question based on the given passages. Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nQuestion: Who lived longer, Fredy Schmidtke or Chou Meng-Tieh?\nAnswer:", "input": "Who lived longer, Fredy Schmidtke or Chou Meng-Tieh?", "context": "Passage 1:\nGaius Julius Aquila\nGaius Julius Aquila was the name of a number of people who lived during the Roman Empire.\n\nPrefect of Egypt\nGaius Julius Aquila was a praefectus of Roman Egypt between 10 CE and 11.\n\nGovernor of Bythinia et Pontus\nGaius Julius Aquila was a Roman knight, stationed with a few cohorts, in 45 CE, to protect Tiberius Julius Cotys I, king of the Bosporan Kingdom, who had received the sovereignty after the expulsion of Tiberius Julius Mithridates. In the same year, Aquila obtained the praetorian insignia. He also erected a monument honouring the emperor Claudius in Asia Minor (modern Turkey) known as the Ku\u015fkayas\u0131 Monument.\nPassage 2:\nMaximus of Tyre\nMaximus of Tyre (Greek: \u039c\u03ac\u03be\u03b9\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 \u03a4\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2; fl. late 2nd century AD), also known as Cassius Maximus Tyrius, was a Greek rhetorician and philosopher who lived in the time of the Antonines and Commodus, and who belongs to the trend of the Second Sophistic.  His writings contain many allusions to the history of Greece, while there is little reference to Rome; hence it is inferred that he lived longer in Greece, perhaps as a professor at Athens. Although nominally a Platonist, he is really a sophist rather than a philosopher, although he is still considered one of the precursors of Neoplatonism.\n\nWritings\nThe Dissertations\nThere exist 41 essays or discourses on theological, ethical, and other philosophical subjects, collected into a work called The Dissertations. The central theme is God as the supreme being, one and indivisible though called by many names, accessible to reason alone:\nIn such a mighty contest, sedition and discord, you will see one according law and assertion in all the earth, that there is one God, the king and father of all things, and many gods, sons of God, ruling together with him.\nAs animals form the intermediate stage between plants and human beings, so there exist intermediaries between God and man, viz. daemons, who dwell on the confines of heaven and earth. The soul in many ways bears a great resemblance to the divinity; it is partly mortal, partly immortal, and, when freed from the fetters of the body, becomes a daemon. Life is the sleep of the soul, from which it awakes at death. The style of Maximus is superior to that of the ordinary sophistical rhetorician, but scholars differ widely as to the merits of the essays themselves.Dissertation XX discusses \"Whether the Life of a Cynic is to Be Preferred\". He begins with a narrative of how Prometheus created mankind, who initially lived a life of ease \"for the earth supplied them with aliment, rich meadows, long-haired mountains, and abundance of fruits\" \u2013 in other words, a Garden of Eden that resonates with Cynic ideas. It was \"a life without war, without iron, without a guard, peaceful, healthful unindigent\".\nThen, taking perhaps from Lucretius, he contrasts that Garden to mankind's \"second life\", which started with the division of the earth into property, which they then enclosed into fortifications and walls, and started to wear jewellery and gold, built houses, \u201cmolested the earth by digging into it for metals\u201d, and invaded the sea and the air (killing animals, fish and birds), in what he described as a \u201cslaughter and all-various gore, pursuing gratification of the body\u201d. Humans became unhappy and, to compensate, sought wealth, \u201cfearing poverty...dreading death...neglecting the care of life...They blamed base actions but did not abstain from them and \u201cthe hated to live, but dreaded to die\u201d.He then contrasts the two lives \u2013 that of the original Garden and of the \u201csecond life\u201d he has just described and asks, which man would not choose the first, who \u201cknows that by the change he shall be liberated from a multitude of evils\u201d and what he calls \u201ca dreadful prison of unhappy men, confined to a dreadful prison of unhappy men, confined in a dark recess, with large iron fetters round their feet, a great weight about their neck\u2026passing their time in filth, in torment, and in weeping\u201d. He asks, \u201cWhich of these images shall we proclaim blessed\u201d? He goes on to praise Diogenes of Sinopeus, the Cynic, for choosing his ascetic life, but only because he avoided the often fearful fates of other philosophers \u2013 such as Socrates being condemned. But there is no mention of he himself taking up the ascetic life himself; rather he only talks about how the Garden would be preferable to the life mankind has made for itself. So it is unlikely he was a Cynic, but was just envious of that idealised pre-civilisation Life in the Garden.Maximus of Tyre must be distinguished from the Stoic Claudius Maximus, tutor of Marcus Aurelius.\n\nAncient Greek Text\nMaximus Tyrius, Philosophumena, Dialexeis - Edited by George Leonidas Koniaris, Publisher Walter de Gruyter, 1995, DOI: https://doi.org/10.1515/9783110882568 - this critical edition presents the Ancient Greek text of Maximus of Tyre.\n\nTranslations\nTaylor, Thomas, The Dissertations of Maximus Tyrius.

He must have lived after Gnaeus Pompeius Trogus, whose work he excerpted, and his references to the Romans and Parthians' having divided the world between themselves would have been anachronistic after the rise of the Sassanians in the third century. His Latin appears to be consistent with the style of the second century. Ronald Syme, however, argues for a date around AD 390, immediately before the compilation of the Augustan History, and dismisses anachronisms and the archaic style as unimportant, as he asserts readers would have understood Justin's phrasing to represent Trogus' time, and not his own.\n\nWorks\nJustin was the author of an epitome of Trogus' expansive Liber Historiarum Philippicarum, or Philippic Histories, a history of the kings of Macedonia, compiled in the time of Augustus.  Due to its numerous digressions, this work was retitled by one of its editors, Historia Philippicae et Totius Mundi Origines et Terrae Situs, or Philippic History and Origins of the Entire World and All of its Lands.  Justin's preface explains that he aimed to collect the most important and interesting passages of that work, which has since been lost.  Some of Trogus' original arguments (prologi) are preserved in various other authors, such as Pliny the Elder.  Trogus' main theme was the rise and history of the Macedonian Empire, and like him, Justin permitted himself considerable freedom of digression, producing an idiosyncratic anthology rather than a strict epitome.\n\nLegacy\nJustin's history was much used in the Middle Ages, when its author was sometimes mistakenly conflated with Justin Martyr.\n\nNotes", "answers": ["Chou Meng-Tieh"], "length": 2903, "dataset": "2wikimqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "e1439b2d77ce90280f85c9b3aaca79d8880aa1f7d97545ea", "pred": " Chou Meng-Tieh."}

He was an innovative composer of instrumental music as well as songs, and was the composer of the earliest surviving music for the guitar.\n\nBiography\nThe place of his birth is not recorded, but he grew up in Guadalajara, and probably received his musical training there.  He most likely went to Italy in 1529 with Charles V, in the company of the fourth Duke of the Infantado, \u00cd\u00f1igo L\u00f3pez de Mendoza, marqu\u00e9s de Santillana.  When he returned to Spain he became a priest, receiving the post of canon at the cathedral in Seville in 1546, where he remained for the rest of his life.  While at the cathedral, he directed all of the musical activities; many records remain of his musical activities there, which included hiring instrumentalists, buying and assembling a new organ, and working closely with composer Francisco Guerrero for various festivities.  Mudarra died in Seville, and his sizable fortune was distributed to the poor of the city according to his will.\n\nMudarra wrote numerous pieces for the vihuela and the four-course guitar, all contained in the collection Tres libros de musica en cifras para vihuela (\"Three books of music in numbers for vihuela\"), which he published on December 7, 1546 in Seville.  These three books contain the first music ever published for the four-course guitar, which was then a relatively new instrument. The second book is noteworthy in that it contains eight multi-movement works, all arranged by \"tono\", or mode.\nCompositions represented in this publication include fantasias, variations (including a set on La Folia), tientos, pavanes and galliards, and songs. Modern listeners are probably most familiar with his Fantasia X, which has been a concert and recording mainstay for many years.   The songs are in Latin, Spanish and Italian, and include romances, canciones (songs), villancicos, (popular songs) and sonetos (sonnets).  Another innovation was the use of different signs for different tempos:  slow, medium, and fast.\n\nReferences and further reading\nJohn Griffiths: \"Alonso Mudarra\", Grove Music Online ed. L.

He is best known as the composer of the theme music for the original Star Trek series.\n\nEarly life\nCourage was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He received a music degree from the Eastman School of Music in Rochester, New York, in 1941. He served in the United States Army Air Forces in the western United States during the Second World War. During that period, he also found the time to compose music for the radio. His credits in this medium include the programs Adventures of Sam Spade Detective, Broadway Is My Beat, Hollywood Soundstage, and Romance.\n\nCareer\nCourage began as an orchestrator and arranger at MGM studios, which included work in such films as the 1951 Show Boat (\"Life Upon the Wicked Stage\" number); Hot Rod Rumble (1957 film); The Band Wagon (\"I Guess I'll Have to Change My Plan\"); Gigi (the can-can for the entrance of patrons at Maxim's); and the barn raising dance from Seven Brides for Seven Brothers.\nHe frequently served as an orchestrator on films scored by Andr\u00e9 Previn (My Fair Lady, \"The Circus is a Wacky World\", and \"You're Gonna Hear from Me\" production numbers for Inside Daisy Clover), Adolph Deutsch (Funny Face, Some Like It Hot), John Williams (The Poseidon Adventure, Superman, Jurassic Park, and the Academy Award-nominated musical films Fiddler on the Roof and Tom Sawyer), and Jerry Goldsmith (Rudy, Mulan, The Mummy, et al.).  He also arranged the Leslie Bricusse score (along with Lionel Newman) for Doctor Dolittle (1967).Apart from his work as a respected orchestrator, Courage also contributed original dramatic scores to films, including two westerns: Arthur Penn's The Left Handed Gun (1958) and Andr\u00e9 de Toth's Day of the Outlaw (1959), and the Connie Francis comedy Follow the Boys (1963). He continued writing music for movies throughout the 1980s and 1990s, including the score for Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (1987), which incorporated three new musical themes by John Williams in addition to Courage's adapted and original cues for the film. Courage's score for Superman IV: The Quest for Peace was released on CD in early 2008 by the Film Music Monthly company as part of its boxed set Superman - The Music, while La-La Land Records released a fully expanded restoration of the score on May 8, 2018, as part of Superman's 80th anniversary.\nCourage also worked as a composer on such television shows as Daniel Boone, The Brothers Brannagan, Lost in Space, Eight Is Enough, and Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea. Judd, for the Defense, Young Dr. Kildare and The Brothers Brannagan were the only television series besides Star Trek for which he composed the main theme.\nThe composer Jerry Goldsmith and Courage teamed on the long-running television show The Waltons in which Goldsmith composed the theme and Courage the Aaron Copland-influenced incidental music. In 1988, Courage won an Emmy Award for his music direction on the special Julie Andrews: The Sound of Christmas.  In the 1990s, Courage succeeded Arthur Morton as Goldsmith's primary orchestrator.Courage and Goldsmith collaborated again on orchestrations for Goldsmith's score for the 1997 film \"The Edge.\"\nCourage frequently collaborated with John Williams during the latter's tenure with the Boston Pops Orchestra.\n\nFamily\nAt the age of 35, Courage married Mareile Beate Odlum on October 6, 1955.\nMareile, born in Germany, was the daughter of Rudolf Wolff and Elisabeth Loechelt. After Wolff's suicide Elisabeth married Carl Wilhelm Richard H\u00fclsenbeck, renowned for his involvement in the Dada movement in Europe. H\u00fclsenbeck brought his wife (Elisabeth), son (Tom) and step-daughter (Mareile) to the United States in 1938 to avoid the political situation rapidly developing in Europe. After arriving in the US he changed his last name to Hulbeck.\nMareile's marriage to Courage was her third. Her second marriage was to Bruce Odlum (son of financier Floyd Odlum) in 1944. That union produced two sons, Christopher (1947) and Brian (1949). When Courage married Mareile he accepted the responsibility of acting stepfather to them. The family originally lived together on Erskine Dr. in Pacific Palisades, but later moved to a mountainside home on Beverly Crest Drive in Beverly Hills.\nAside from his musical abilities Courage was also an avid and accomplished photographer. He took many dramatic photos of bullfights and auto racing. He was a racing enthusiast, and his interest in that sport and photography brought him into contact with many racing personalities of the era, notably Phil Hill and Stirling Moss, both of whom he considered friends. Moss paid at least one social visit to the Erskine residence.\nThough a dedicated stepfather to Christopher and Brian, Courage's musical career took precedence over his familial responsibilities. He sought to interest his step-children in music, and was responsible for arranging Brian's first musical lessons, on alto saxophone. Later in life Brian became a composer of serious electronic music, though the vocation was not apparent during his childhood, as he was a poor saxophone student.\nAlexander and Mareile were divorced April 1, 1963. Courage subsequently married Kristin M. Zethren on July 14, 1967. That marriage also ended in divorce in 1972.\n\nStar Trek theme\nCourage is best known for writing the theme music for the original Star Trek series, and other music for that series. Courage was hired by Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry to score the original series at Jerry Goldsmith's suggestion, after Goldsmith turned down the job.  \nCourage went on to score incidental music for episodes \"The Man Trap\" and \"The Naked Time\" and some cues for \"Mudd's Women.\"\nCourage reportedly became alienated from Roddenberry when Roddenberry claimed half of the theme music royalties. Roddenberry wrote words for Courage's theme, not because he expected the lyrics to be sung on television, but so that he (Roddenberry) could receive half of the royalties from the song by claiming credit as the composition's co-writer. Courage was replaced by composer Fred Steiner who was then hired to write the musical scores for the remainder of the first season. \nAfter sound editors had difficulty finding the right effect, Courage himself made the iconic \"whoosh\" sound heard while the Enterprise flies across the screen.He returned to Star Trek to score two more episodes for the show's third and final season, episodes \"The Enterprise Incident\" and \"Plato's Stepchildren,\" allegedly as a courtesy to Producer Robert Justman.\nNotably, after later serving as Goldsmith's orchestrator, when Goldsmith composed the music for Star Trek: The Motion Picture,  Courage orchestrated Goldsmith's adaptation of his original Star Trek theme.\nFollowing Star Trek: The Motion Picture, Courage's iconic opening fanfare to the Star Trek theme became one of the franchise's most famous and memorable musical cues. The fanfare has been used in multiple motion pictures and television series,  notably Star Trek: The Next Generation and the four feature films based upon that series, three of which were scored by Goldsmith.\n\nDeath\nCourage had been in declining health for several years before he died on May 15, 2008, at the Sunrise assisted-living facility in Pacific Palisades, California. He had suffered a series of strokes prior to his death. His mausoleum is in Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery.\nPassage 7:\nShue Ming-fa\nShue Ming-fa (born 2 November 1950) is a former Taiwanese cyclist. He competed in three events at the 1972 Summer Olympics.\nPassage 8:\nPetrus de Domarto\nPetrus de Domarto (fl. c. 1445\u20131455) was a Franco-Flemish composer of the Renaissance.  He was a contemporary and probable acquaintance of Ockeghem, and was the composer of at least one of the first unified mass cycles to be written in continental Europe.\n\nLife\nDomarto's life is poorly documented.  He was listed as a singer at the Church of Our Lady in Antwerp in 1449, five years after Ockeghem was known to be there, and there is evidence he was in Tournai in 1451.  He had a high reputation (which makes the lack of documentation on his life curious), but even so was passed over for a post as master of the choirboys (in favor of Paulus Iuvenis).  No other documentation on his life has yet come to light.\n\nMusic and reputation\nDomarto's two mass settings, the Missa Spiritus almus and a Missa sine nomine, were famous at the time.  The latter of the two may have been one of the earliest cyclic masses composed on the continent, most likely in the 1440s, and imitates some features of contemporary English composers such as Leonel Power.  The Missa Spiritus almus, likely dating from the 1450s, is a cantus-firmus mass, with the melody always in the tenor, but with a changing rhythmic profile as it changes mensuration throughout the piece.  The procedure was evidently influential on the next generation of composers, for it was still being copied in the 1480s, and Busnois may have based one of his own masses on the same method (the Missa O crux lignum). The theorist and writer Johannes Tinctoris criticised it for exactly the features that inspired other composers.\nThe two surviving secular compositions by Domarto are both rondeaux, formes fixes of the type popular with the Burgundian School.\n\nWorks\nMasses\nMissa Spiritus almus (four voices)\nMissa sine nomine (three voices)\n\nSecular\nRondeaux, each for three voices:\n\nChelui qui est tant plain de duel\nJe vis tous jours en esperance\n\nNotes\nPassage 9:\nAlexandru Cristea\nAlexandru Cristea (1890\u20131942) was the composer of the music for \"Limba Noastr\u0103\", current national anthem of Moldova.\n\nBiography\nA choir director, a composer and music teacher.

Later, between 1941 and 1942, he directed the choir at the \"Queen Mother Elena\" high school from Chi\u015fin\u0103u. In 1920, he was ordained as a deacon of the St. George Church in Chi\u015fin\u0103u, from 1927 to 1941 was a deacon holds the Metropolitan Cathedral of Chi\u015fin\u0103u.\n\nCreation\nHis main creation is considered the music for \"Limba Noastr\u0103\", current national anthem of Moldova, composed in the lyrics of the priest-poet Alexei Mateevici. He was awarded the \u201cR\u0103splata muncii pentru biseric\u0103\u201d.\nPassage 10:\nClaudio Mattone\nClaudio Mattone (born 28 February 1943) is an Italian composer, lyricist and music producer.\nBorn in Santa Maria a Vico, Caserta, Mattone approached music at young age, as a jazz pianist. After leaving the university he moved to Rome, where he debuted in 1968 as a singer-songwriter with the song \"E' sera\", that premiered without any success at Cantagiro '68. Focusing on composition, between late sixties and early eighties he successfully teamed with the lyricist Franco Migliacci and signed several hits, contributing to launch the careers of Nada and Eduardo De Crescenzo; also working as music producer and as lyricist of his songs, in nineties Mattone launched the careers of Neri per caso and Syria, that respectively won the 1994 and 1995 editions of the Sanremo Music Festival in the \"giovani\" category.In 1990 Mattone won a David di Donatello and a Nastro d'Argento for the soundtrack of the 1989 film Scugnizzi. His earlier scores had included Cugini carnali (1974), Cos\u00ec parl\u00f2 Bellavista (1984), Il mistero di Bellavista (1985) and Fatto su misura (1985).

In the 1990s, Courage succeeded Arthur Morton as Goldsmith's primary orchestrator.Courage and Goldsmith collaborated again on orchestrations for Goldsmith's score for the 1997 film \"The Edge.\"\nCourage frequently collaborated with John Williams during the latter's tenure with the Boston Pops Orchestra.\n\nFamily\nAt the age of 35, Courage married Mareile Beate Odlum on October 6, 1955.\nMareile, born in Germany, was the daughter of Rudolf Wolff and Elisabeth Loechelt. After Wolff's suicide Elisabeth married Carl Wilhelm Richard H\u00fclsenbeck, renowned for his involvement in the Dada movement in Europe. H\u00fclsenbeck brought his wife (Elisabeth), son (Tom) and step-daughter (Mareile) to the United States in 1938 to avoid the political situation rapidly developing in Europe. After arriving in the US he changed his last name to Hulbeck.\nMareile's marriage to Courage was her third. Her second marriage was to Bruce Odlum (son of financier Floyd Odlum) in 1944. That union produced two sons, Christopher (1947) and Brian (1949). When Courage married Mareile he accepted the responsibility of acting stepfather to them. The family originally lived together on Erskine Dr. in Pacific Palisades, but later moved to a mountainside home on Beverly Crest Drive in Beverly Hills.\nAside from his musical abilities Courage was also an avid and accomplished photographer. He took many dramatic photos of bullfights and auto racing. He was a racing enthusiast, and his interest in that sport and photography brought him into contact with many racing personalities of the era, notably Phil Hill and Stirling Moss, both of whom he considered friends. Moss paid at least one social visit to the Erskine residence.\nThough a dedicated stepfather to Christopher and Brian, Courage's musical career took precedence over his familial responsibilities. He sought to interest his step-children in music, and was responsible for arranging Brian's first musical lessons, on alto saxophone. Later in life Brian became a composer of serious electronic music, though the vocation was not apparent during his childhood, as he was a poor saxophone student.\nAlexander and Mareile were divorced April 1, 1963. Courage subsequently married Kristin M. Zethren on July 14, 1967. That marriage also ended in divorce in 1972.\n\nStar Trek theme\nCourage is best known for writing the theme music for the original Star Trek series, and other music for that series. Courage was hired by Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry to score the original series at Jerry Goldsmith's suggestion, after Goldsmith turned down the job.  \nCourage went on to score incidental music for episodes \"The Man Trap\" and \"The Naked Time\" and some cues for \"Mudd's Women.\"\nCourage reportedly became alienated from Roddenberry when Roddenberry claimed half of the theme music royalties. Roddenberry wrote words for Courage's theme, not because he expected the lyrics to be sung on television, but so that he (Roddenberry) could receive half of the royalties from the song by claiming credit as the composition's co-writer. Courage was replaced by composer Fred Steiner who was then hired to write the musical scores for the remainder of the first season. \nAfter sound editors had difficulty finding the right effect, Courage himself made the iconic \"whoosh\" sound heard while the Enterprise flies across the screen.He returned to Star Trek to score two more episodes for the show's third and final season, episodes \"The Enterprise Incident\" and \"Plato's Stepchildren,\" allegedly as a courtesy to Producer Robert Justman.\nNotably, after later serving as Goldsmith's orchestrator, when Goldsmith composed the music for Star Trek: The Motion Picture,  Courage orchestrated Goldsmith's adaptation of his original Star Trek theme.\nFollowing Star Trek: The Motion Picture, Courage's iconic opening fanfare to the Star Trek theme became one of the franchise's most famous and memorable musical cues. The fanfare has been used in multiple motion pictures and television series,  notably Star Trek: The Next Generation and the four feature films based upon that series, three of which were scored by Goldsmith.\n\nDeath\nCourage had been in declining health for several years before he died on May 15, 2008, at the Sunrise assisted-living facility in Pacific Palisades, California. He had suffered a series of strokes prior to his death. His mausoleum is in Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery.\nPassage 7:\nShue Ming-fa\nShue Ming-fa (born 2 November 1950) is a former Taiwanese cyclist. He competed in three events at the 1972 Summer Olympics.\nPassage 8:\nPetrus de Domarto\nPetrus de Domarto (fl. c. 1445\u20131455) was a Franco-Flemish composer of the Renaissance.  He was a contemporary and probable acquaintance of Ockeghem, and was the composer of at least one of the first unified mass cycles to be written in continental Europe.\n\nLife\nDomarto's life is poorly documented.  He was listed as a singer at the Church of Our Lady in Antwerp in 1449, five years after Ockeghem was known to be there, and there is evidence he was in Tournai in 1451.  He had a high reputation (which makes the lack of documentation on his life curious), but even so was passed over for a post as master of the choirboys (in favor of Paulus Iuvenis).  No other documentation on his life has yet come to light.\n\nMusic and reputation\nDomarto's two mass settings, the Missa Spiritus almus and a Missa sine nomine, were famous at the time.  The latter of the two may have been one of the earliest cyclic masses composed on the continent, most likely in the 1440s, and imitates some features of contemporary English composers such as Leonel Power.  The Missa Spiritus almus, likely dating from the 1450s, is a cantus-firmus mass, with the melody always in the tenor, but with a changing rhythmic profile as it changes mensuration throughout the piece.  The procedure was evidently influential on the next generation of composers, for it was still being copied in the 1480s, and Busnois may have based one of his own masses on the same method (the Missa O crux lignum). The theorist and writer Johannes Tinctoris criticised it for exactly the features that inspired other composers.\nThe two surviving secular compositions by Domarto are both rondeaux, formes fixes of the type popular with the Burgundian School.\n\nWorks\nMasses\nMissa Spiritus almus (four voices)\nMissa sine nomine (three voices)\n\nSecular\nRondeaux, each for three voices:\n\nChelui qui est tant plain de duel\nJe vis tous jours en esperance\n\nNotes\nPassage 9:\nAlexandru Cristea\nAlexandru Cristea (1890\u20131942) was the composer of the music for \"Limba Noastr\u0103\", current national anthem of Moldova.\n\nBiography\nA choir director, a composer and music teacher. Taught at the  \"Vasile Kormilov\" music school (1928) with Gavriil Afanasiu and the  \"Unirea\" Conservatory (1927\u20131929) in Chi\u015fin\u0103u with Alexandru Antonovschi (canto), he was the master of vocal music from Chi\u015fin\u0103u (1920\u20131940), professor of music and conductor of the choir in the boys gymnasium \"Ion Heliade R\u0103dulescu\" in Bucure\u0219ti (1940\u20131941). Later, between 1941 and 1942, he directed the choir at the \"Queen Mother Elena\" high school from Chi\u015fin\u0103u. In 1920, he was ordained as a deacon of the St. George Church in Chi\u015fin\u0103u, from 1927 to 1941 was a deacon holds the Metropolitan Cathedral of Chi\u015fin\u0103u.\n\nCreation\nHis main creation is considered the music for \"Limba Noastr\u0103\", current national anthem of Moldova, composed in the lyrics of the priest-poet Alexei Mateevici. He was awarded the \u201cR\u0103splata muncii pentru biseric\u0103\u201d.\nPassage 10:\nClaudio Mattone\nClaudio Mattone (born 28 February 1943) is an Italian composer, lyricist and music producer.\nBorn in Santa Maria a Vico, Caserta, Mattone approached music at young age, as a jazz pianist. After leaving the university he moved to Rome, where he debuted in 1968 as a singer-songwriter with the song \"E' sera\", that premiered without any success at Cantagiro '68. Focusing on composition, between late sixties and early eighties he successfully teamed with the lyricist Franco Migliacci and signed several hits, contributing to launch the careers of Nada and Eduardo De Crescenzo; also working as music producer and as lyricist of his songs, in nineties Mattone launched the careers of Neri per caso and Syria, that respectively won the 1994 and 1995 editions of the Sanremo Music Festival in the \"giovani\" category.In 1990 Mattone won a David di Donatello and a Nastro d'Argento for the soundtrack of the 1989 film Scugnizzi.

The film is directed by Michael Joy from a screenplay co-written with John L. Simpson.\n\nPlot\nThe film follows the lives of six men over a period of months as they convene weekly in a self-help style group. Meeting at the home of Paul, the men include Freddy, a depressed stand-up comedian; the elderly Cecil; businessman Lucas; the bereaved Anthony; taciturn Moses; and talkative, middle-aged Alex. As trust grows between the men they gradually begin to open up and learn to listen to each other, discovering they are not alone in their fears as they had presumed. When a tragedy befalls the group, the men realize they must take responsibilities for their own lives and those of their loved ones.\n\nCast\nGrant Dodwell as Alex\nPaul Gleeson as Paul\nSteve Le Marquand as Lucas\nDon Reid as Cecil\nSteve Rodgers as Freddy\nPaul Tassone as Moses\nWilliam Zappa as Anthony\n\nProduction\nDevelopment\nThe concept of the film was conceived by Michael Joy and John L. Simpson, while working together on another project dealing with men's issues and their inability to communicate. At that time, director Michael Joy was experiencing depression and attended a men's support group on the advice of a telephone counsellor. Joy was struck by the pain of the men in the room and the safe environment in which they could express what they were going through.\n\nFilming\nJoy worked with each of the actors separately, workshopping the script over two months. Using this technique, Michael and John L. would create scenes from key character points and events. Only then was a comprehensive screenplay drafted and delivered to the heads of departments.The actors were not allowed to see the screenplay prior to shooting, and had little or no idea of other characters' story lines. The filmmakers did this to capture the actors' first responses to what was unfolding in front of them. There was only one take for each shot that appears in the film, and the shoot lasted only 14 days. It was shot in sequence, so the filmmakers could not go back to reshoot. Before each scene, Joy spent time talking to the actors quietly and individually about their lives at that point, trying to get them to speak about specific things that needed to happen in the film.The film was a micro-budget production, created on a reverse finance model, with each key crew member and actor taking an equity position in the film.\n\nReception\nThe film was praised and is particularly recognised for the strong performances by the lead actors. Anton Bitel of Eye for Film wrote the film \"represents a refreshing examination of the collective male psyche through pure drama\", and added the improvisational nature of the film results in an \"ensemble performances of searing, warts-and-all realism, so utterly believable that viewers themselves will feel like silent members of the party, compelled by the power of the proceedings to watch, listen, learn \u2013 and maybe join in the conversation after the credits have rolled.\" On At the Movies, Margaret Pomeranz awarded the film four stars and David Stratton awarded it three and a half stars.On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, Men's Group has an approval rating of 86% based on 7 reviews.\n\nAFI Fellowship and Tour\nFollowing the theatrical release of the film by Titan View, John L. Simpson was approached by men's health groups who wished to screen the film and use it as a tool to prompt discussions about men's mental health. With this interest, Simpson proposed to tour the film around Australia to non-theatrical venues for community group screenings, and in the process create a map of all venues in Australia suitable to screen from. For this proposal he was awarded the 2008 AFI Fellowship.The program has allowed the film to tour to towns such as Tamworth, Armidale, Bellingen, Dorrigo, Bowraville, and Bowral.\nIn early March 2009, Men\u2019s Group was screened to men's and women's prisons in Tasmania.\n\nAwards and nominations\nFilm Critics Circle of Australia\n2009: Nominated, Best Actor \u2013 Grant DodwellInside Film Awards\n\n2008: Won, Best Actor \u2013 Grant Dodwell\n2008: Won, Best Feature Film \u2013 John L.

The film faithfully traced the course of this humorous and enterprising attempt to wake up the populace, filling out the basic plot with irreverent patriotic gags.\nPassage 5:\nTimes of Joy and Sorrow\nTimes of Joy and Sorrow (USA title), The Lighthouse (UK title), or\n\u559c\u3073\u3082\u60b2\u3057\u307f\u3082\u5e7e\u6b73\u6708 (Yorokobi mo Kanashimi mo Ikutoshitsuki), is a 1957 color Japanese film directed by Keisuke Kinoshita, who shot on location at 10 different lighthouses throughout Japan, including opening scenes at Kannonzaki, the site of the country's first lighthouse.\n\nPlot\nIn 1932, a young lighthouse keeper returns from his father's funeral with a new bride, who quickly learns the importance of the marital bond to members of her husband's profession, which is often characterized by the hardships of physical isolation and sudden reassignment.

With Cookie's help, Eve remakes herself using an outfit made from a curtain and some beads, which draws the interest of both Chang and Bob. In the end, Eve saves the day and she and Bob are married on board by a missionary (Hoyt).\n\nCast\nProduction\nLeatrice Joy had impulsively cut her hair short in 1926, and DeMille, whom Joy had followed when he set up Producers Distributing Corporation, was publicly angry as it prevented her from portraying traditional feminine roles. The studio developed projects with roles suitable for her \u201cLeatrice Joy bob\u201d, and Eve's Leaves was the second of five films before she regrew her hair. In both Eve's Leaves and The Clinging Vine (1926), Joy's character is mistaken as being male in at least one scene.

Yasmin, in her blog, has described it \"as a story full of joy and pain, hope and despair, a host of beautifully-written songs, and rich characters\". A Hindu open cremation and a scene reminiscent of the 2001 Kampung Medan riots are included in the film.The film was released on 26 March 2009 in Malaysia and marks Yasmin's last feature film prior to her death on 25 July 2009.\n\nPlot\n\"The music teacher, who is herself a great performer is organising an inter-school talentime. Through the days of auditions, rehearsals and preparations, running up to the big day of the contest, the characters get embroiled in a world of heightened emotions - ambition, jealousy, human comedy, romance, heartbreak - all of which culminate in a day of great music and performances.\" Yasmin also mentioned that the idea behind Talentime was that as humans, we have to go through a lot of pain and some measure of suffering before we can reach greater heights.A talent search competition has matched two hearts - that of Melur, a Malay-mixed girl and an Indian male student, Mahesh. Melur, with her melodious voice, singing whilst playing the piano is one of the seven finalists of the Talentime competition of her school organised by Cikgu Adibah. Likewise Hafiz, enthralling with his vocalist talent while playing the guitar, dividing his time between school and mother, who is hospitalised for brain tumor.\nIt all started after Mahesh, amongst the students assigned to get the finalists to school for practice, delivered the notice of successful audition to Melur's house. His handsome looks attracted the girl. Early on in their relationship, tragedy struck Mahesh's family when his uncle Ganesh who had been the care-taker of the family since the loss of Mahesh's father, was stabbed to death on his wedding day. Melur thinking that Mahesh's silence was due to his grief over the tragedy became furious when she was continuously ignored. She regretted it however after Hafiz revealed Mahesh's situation.\nThat changed Melur's perception of Mahesh. Likewise Mahesh, who grew comfortable with the presence of the girl who often quotes beautiful poetry. Mahesh, realising that the relationship will be opposed, kept it hidden from his mother, still grieving over the death of Ganesh. At last, the secret was exposed and Mahesh was assaulted before Melur's very eyes. Just a day before the competition, is Melur resilient enough to sing the poetic lyrics of her song when her heart is tormented by the thoughts of Mahesh? What about Mahesh who has found his first love? On Talentime night, everything unfolds.\n\nCast\nMahesh Jugal Kishor as Mahesh, a hearing impaired Indian boy who becomes Melur's love interest.\nPamela Chong as Melur, a Eurasian girl in the Talentime finals who sings and plays the piano.\nSyafie Naswip as Hafiz, a Malay boy in the Talentime finals who sings and plays the guitar.\nJaclyn Victor as Bhavani, Mahesh's elder sister who has a penchant for picking on him.\nHoward Hon Kahoe as Kahoe, a Chinese boy in the Talentime finals who plays the erhu and resents Hafiz.\nAmelia Henderson as Melati, Melur's younger sister.\nAdibah Noor as Cikgu Adibah, the teacher in charge of organising the Talentime.\nAzean Irdawaty as Embun, Hafiz's mother who is diagnosed with terminal brain cancer.\nHarith Iskander as Harith, Melur's comical father.\nSukania Venugopal as Mahesh's mother.\nJit Murad as Ismael, A patient who befriends Embun at the hospital during her final days.\nMislina Mustaffa as Melur's mother.\nTan Mei Ling as Mei Ling, a Chinese Muslim convert who works as a maid for Melur's family.\nIda Nerina as Datin Kalsom, a friend of Melur's mother who distrusts Mei Ling.Sharifah Amani was supposed to be cast as Melur in the film. However, due to clash of schedules, she was replaced by Pamela Chong. She did, however, play a role as the 3rd Assistant Director for the film. This would mark the first time that Sharifah Amani has played a behind-the-scene role in Yasmin Ahmad's films.\n\nMusic\nThe film score was composed by Pete Teo. Songs include:\n\nO Re Piya by Rahat Fateh Ali Khan, taken from the Bollywood movie, Aaja Nachle\nI Go by Aizat Amdan.\nJust One Boy by Aizat Amdan.\nAngel by Atilia.\nKasih Tak Kembali by Atilia.All songs were written and produced by Teo himself, except Kasih Tak Kembali which was written by Ahmad Hashim.\nThe original soundtrack album was released by Universal Music, which also includes Malay language versions of many of the principal songs in the film. This includes I Go (as 'Pergi'), Angel, and Just One Boy (as 'Itulah Dirimu').\n\nScreening\nAs in all of Yasmin's previous works, Talentime opens with the basmalah (Bismillahirahmanirrahim, \"In the name of God, the most Gracious and most Merciful\"). Like Muallaf, the verse is displayed in a language and script different from Arabic in Talentime, i.e. in Tamil - \u0baa\u0bbf\u0bb8\u0bcd\u0bae\u0bbf\u0bb2\u0bcd\u0bb2\u0bbe\u0bb9\u0bbf\u0bb0\u0bcd\u0bb0\u0bb9\u0bcd\u0bae\u0bbe\u0ba9\u0bbf\u0bb0\u0bcd\u0bb0\u0bb9\u0bc0\u0bae\u0bcd.\n\nAwards and nominations\nPassage 10:\nKomaligal\n\"Komaligal\" (1976) (Tamil: \u0b95\u0bcb\u0bae\u0bbe\u0bb3\u0bbf\u0b95\u0bb3\u0bcd, \"The Clowns\") is a Sri Lankan Tamil language film written by S.Ramdas and produced by M.Mohamed.

The film is directed by Michael Joy from a screenplay co-written with John L. Simpson.\n\nPlot\nThe film follows the lives of six men over a period of months as they convene weekly in a self-help style group. Meeting at the home of Paul, the men include Freddy, a depressed stand-up comedian; the elderly Cecil; businessman Lucas; the bereaved Anthony; taciturn Moses; and talkative, middle-aged Alex. As trust grows between the men they gradually begin to open up and learn to listen to each other, discovering they are not alone in their fears as they had presumed. When a tragedy befalls the group, the men realize they must take responsibilities for their own lives and those of their loved ones.\n\nCast\nGrant Dodwell as Alex\nPaul Gleeson as Paul\nSteve Le Marquand as Lucas\nDon Reid as Cecil\nSteve Rodgers as Freddy\nPaul Tassone as Moses\nWilliam Zappa as Anthony\n\nProduction\nDevelopment\nThe concept of the film was conceived by Michael Joy and John L. Simpson, while working together on another project dealing with men's issues and their inability to communicate. At that time, director Michael Joy was experiencing depression and attended a men's support group on the advice of a telephone counsellor. Joy was struck by the pain of the men in the room and the safe environment in which they could express what they were going through.\n\nFilming\nJoy worked with each of the actors separately, workshopping the script over two months. Using this technique, Michael and John L. would create scenes from key character points and events. Only then was a comprehensive screenplay drafted and delivered to the heads of departments.The actors were not allowed to see the screenplay prior to shooting, and had little or no idea of other characters' story lines. The filmmakers did this to capture the actors' first responses to what was unfolding in front of them. There was only one take for each shot that appears in the film, and the shoot lasted only 14 days. It was shot in sequence, so the filmmakers could not go back to reshoot. Before each scene, Joy spent time talking to the actors quietly and individually about their lives at that point, trying to get them to speak about specific things that needed to happen in the film.The film was a micro-budget production, created on a reverse finance model, with each key crew member and actor taking an equity position in the film.\n\nReception\nThe film was praised and is particularly recognised for the strong performances by the lead actors. Anton Bitel of Eye for Film wrote the film \"represents a refreshing examination of the collective male psyche through pure drama\", and added the improvisational nature of the film results in an \"ensemble performances of searing, warts-and-all realism, so utterly believable that viewers themselves will feel like silent members of the party, compelled by the power of the proceedings to watch, listen, learn \u2013 and maybe join in the conversation after the credits have rolled.\" On At the Movies, Margaret Pomeranz awarded the film four stars and David Stratton awarded it three and a half stars.On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, Men's Group has an approval rating of 86% based on 7 reviews.\n\nAFI Fellowship and Tour\nFollowing the theatrical release of the film by Titan View, John L. Simpson was approached by men's health groups who wished to screen the film and use it as a tool to prompt discussions about men's mental health. With this interest, Simpson proposed to tour the film around Australia to non-theatrical venues for community group screenings, and in the process create a map of all venues in Australia suitable to screen from. For this proposal he was awarded the 2008 AFI Fellowship.The program has allowed the film to tour to towns such as Tamworth, Armidale, Bellingen, Dorrigo, Bowraville, and Bowral.\nIn early March 2009, Men\u2019s Group was screened to men's and women's prisons in Tasmania.\n\nAwards and nominations\nFilm Critics Circle of Australia\n2009: Nominated, Best Actor \u2013 Grant DodwellInside Film Awards\n\n2008: Won, Best Actor \u2013 Grant Dodwell\n2008: Won, Best Feature Film \u2013 John L.

The film faithfully traced the course of this humorous and enterprising attempt to wake up the populace, filling out the basic plot with irreverent patriotic gags.\nPassage 5:\nTimes of Joy and Sorrow\nTimes of Joy and Sorrow (USA title), The Lighthouse (UK title), or\n\u559c\u3073\u3082\u60b2\u3057\u307f\u3082\u5e7e\u6b73\u6708 (Yorokobi mo Kanashimi mo Ikutoshitsuki), is a 1957 color Japanese film directed by Keisuke Kinoshita, who shot on location at 10 different lighthouses throughout Japan, including opening scenes at Kannonzaki, the site of the country's first lighthouse.\n\nPlot\nIn 1932, a young lighthouse keeper returns from his father's funeral with a new bride, who quickly learns the importance of the marital bond to members of her husband's profession, which is often characterized by the hardships of physical isolation and sudden reassignment.

With Cookie's help, Eve remakes herself using an outfit made from a curtain and some beads, which draws the interest of both Chang and Bob. In the end, Eve saves the day and she and Bob are married on board by a missionary (Hoyt).\n\nCast\nProduction\nLeatrice Joy had impulsively cut her hair short in 1926, and DeMille, whom Joy had followed when he set up Producers Distributing Corporation, was publicly angry as it prevented her from portraying traditional feminine roles. The studio developed projects with roles suitable for her \u201cLeatrice Joy bob\u201d, and Eve's Leaves was the second of five films before she regrew her hair. In both Eve's Leaves and The Clinging Vine (1926), Joy's character is mistaken as being male in at least one scene. In 1928, a professional dispute would end the Joy / Demille partnership and she signed with MGM.\nIntertitles featuring quotes from stereotype Chinese characters are in a racist fictional Asian dialect that today would be considered offensive.\n\nPreservation\nA 16mm print of Eve's Leaves is preserved film at the UCLA Film and Television Archive and the film has been released on DVD.\nPassage 7:\nWasted Time\nWasted Time(s) may refer to:\n\nSongs\n\"Wasted Time\" (Fuel song), 2007\n\"Wasted Time\" (Keith Urban song), 2016\n\"Wasted Time\" (Kings of Leon song), 2003\n\"Wasted Time\" (Skid Row song), 1991\n\"Wasted Time\" (Vance Joy song), 2014\n\"Wasted Times\" (The Weeknd song), 2018\n\"Wasted Time\", by Bret Michaels from Custom Built, 2010\n\"Wasted Time\", by Cloves, 2018\n\"Wasted Time\", by the Eagles from Hotel California, 1976\n\"Wasted Time\", by Europe from Wings of Tomorrow, 1984\n\"Wasted Time\", by Heavenly from Virus, 2006\n\"Wasted Time\", by Holy Knights from Between Daylight and Pain, 2012\n\"Wasted Time\", by Lionel Richie from Renaissance, 2000\n\nOther uses\nThe Wasted Times, a 2016 Chinese-Hong Kong film\n\nSee also\nWasting Time (disambiguation)\nWasting My Time (disambiguation)\n\"Waste Time\", a song by the Fire Theft from their self-titled album\nPassage 8:\nCity of Joy (2016 film)\nCity of Joy is a 2016 documentary film directed and written by Madeleine Gavin.

Yasmin, in her blog, has described it \"as a story full of joy and pain, hope and despair, a host of beautifully-written songs, and rich characters\". A Hindu open cremation and a scene reminiscent of the 2001 Kampung Medan riots are included in the film.The film was released on 26 March 2009 in Malaysia and marks Yasmin's last feature film prior to her death on 25 July 2009.\n\nPlot\n\"The music teacher, who is herself a great performer is organising an inter-school talentime. Through the days of auditions, rehearsals and preparations, running up to the big day of the contest, the characters get embroiled in a world of heightened emotions - ambition, jealousy, human comedy, romance, heartbreak - all of which culminate in a day of great music and performances.\" Yasmin also mentioned that the idea behind Talentime was that as humans, we have to go through a lot of pain and some measure of suffering before we can reach greater heights.A talent search competition has matched two hearts - that of Melur, a Malay-mixed girl and an Indian male student, Mahesh. Melur, with her melodious voice, singing whilst playing the piano is one of the seven finalists of the Talentime competition of her school organised by Cikgu Adibah. Likewise Hafiz, enthralling with his vocalist talent while playing the guitar, dividing his time between school and mother, who is hospitalised for brain tumor.\nIt all started after Mahesh, amongst the students assigned to get the finalists to school for practice, delivered the notice of successful audition to Melur's house. His handsome looks attracted the girl. Early on in their relationship, tragedy struck Mahesh's family when his uncle Ganesh who had been the care-taker of the family since the loss of Mahesh's father, was stabbed to death on his wedding day. Melur thinking that Mahesh's silence was due to his grief over the tragedy became furious when she was continuously ignored. She regretted it however after Hafiz revealed Mahesh's situation.\nThat changed Melur's perception of Mahesh. Likewise Mahesh, who grew comfortable with the presence of the girl who often quotes beautiful poetry. Mahesh, realising that the relationship will be opposed, kept it hidden from his mother, still grieving over the death of Ganesh. At last, the secret was exposed and Mahesh was assaulted before Melur's very eyes. Just a day before the competition, is Melur resilient enough to sing the poetic lyrics of her song when her heart is tormented by the thoughts of Mahesh? What about Mahesh who has found his first love? On Talentime night, everything unfolds.\n\nCast\nMahesh Jugal Kishor as Mahesh, a hearing impaired Indian boy who becomes Melur's love interest.\nPamela Chong as Melur, a Eurasian girl in the Talentime finals who sings and plays the piano.\nSyafie Naswip as Hafiz, a Malay boy in the Talentime finals who sings and plays the guitar.\nJaclyn Victor as Bhavani, Mahesh's elder sister who has a penchant for picking on him.\nHoward Hon Kahoe as Kahoe, a Chinese boy in the Talentime finals who plays the erhu and resents Hafiz.\nAmelia Henderson as Melati, Melur's younger sister.\nAdibah Noor as Cikgu Adibah, the teacher in charge of organising the Talentime.\nAzean Irdawaty as Embun, Hafiz's mother who is diagnosed with terminal brain cancer.\nHarith Iskander as Harith, Melur's comical father.\nSukania Venugopal as Mahesh's mother.\nJit Murad as Ismael, A patient who befriends Embun at the hospital during her final days.\nMislina Mustaffa as Melur's mother.\nTan Mei Ling as Mei Ling, a Chinese Muslim convert who works as a maid for Melur's family.\nIda Nerina as Datin Kalsom, a friend of Melur's mother who distrusts Mei Ling.Sharifah Amani was supposed to be cast as Melur in the film. However, due to clash of schedules, she was replaced by Pamela Chong. She did, however, play a role as the 3rd Assistant Director for the film. This would mark the first time that Sharifah Amani has played a behind-the-scene role in Yasmin Ahmad's films.\n\nMusic\nThe film score was composed by Pete Teo. Songs include:\n\nO Re Piya by Rahat Fateh Ali Khan, taken from the Bollywood movie, Aaja Nachle\nI Go by Aizat Amdan.\nJust One Boy by Aizat Amdan.\nAngel by Atilia.\nKasih Tak Kembali by Atilia.All songs were written and produced by Teo himself, except Kasih Tak Kembali which was written by Ahmad Hashim.\nThe original soundtrack album was released by Universal Music, which also includes Malay language versions of many of the principal songs in the film. This includes I Go (as 'Pergi'), Angel, and Just One Boy (as 'Itulah Dirimu').\n\nScreening\nAs in all of Yasmin's previous works, Talentime opens with the basmalah (Bismillahirahmanirrahim, \"In the name of God, the most Gracious and most Merciful\"). Like Muallaf, the verse is displayed in a language and script different from Arabic in Talentime, i.e. in Tamil - \u0baa\u0bbf\u0bb8\u0bcd\u0bae\u0bbf\u0bb2\u0bcd\u0bb2\u0bbe\u0bb9\u0bbf\u0bb0\u0bcd\u0bb0\u0bb9\u0bcd\u0bae\u0bbe\u0ba9\u0bbf\u0bb0\u0bcd\u0bb0\u0bb9\u0bc0\u0bae\u0bcd.\n\nAwards and nominations\nPassage 10:\nKomaligal\n\"Komaligal\" (1976) (Tamil: \u0b95\u0bcb\u0bae\u0bbe\u0bb3\u0bbf\u0b95\u0bb3\u0bcd, \"The Clowns\") is a Sri Lankan Tamil language film written by S.Ramdas and produced by M.Mohamed.

Her marriage to her first cousin Min Ba Saw\u2014a son of her maternal uncle\u2014was cut short when her brother King Narapati had him executed. Narapati then married her off to Sithu Kyawhtin, then governor of Salin, a powerful figure in the Confederation of Shan States, in a marriage of state in the late 1530s.

This requires a certain number of years lived in said canton.\nCountry citizenship, for which both of the above are required, also requires a certain number of years lived in Switzerland (except for people married to a Swiss citizen, who may obtain simplified naturalisation without having to reside in Switzerland), and involves a criminal background check.The last two kinds of citizenship are a mere formality, while municipal citizenship is the most significant step in becoming a Swiss citizen. \nNowadays the place of residence determines the municipality where citizenship is acquired, for a new applicant, whereas previously there was a historical reason for preserving the municipal citizenship from earlier generations in the family line, namely to specify which municipality held the responsibility of providing social welfare. The law has now been changed, eliminating this form of allocating responsibility to a municipality other than that of the place of residence. Care needs to be taken when translating the term in Swiss documents which list the historical \"Heimatort\" instead of the usual place of birth and place of residence.\nHowever, any Swiss citizen can apply for a second, a third or even more municipal citizenships for prestige reasons or to show their connection to the place they currently live \u2013 and thus have several places of origin. As the legal significance of the place of origin has waned (see below), Swiss citizens can often apply for municipal citizenship for no more than 100 Swiss francs after having lived in the same municipality for one or two years. In the past, it was common to have to pay between 2,000 and 4,000 Swiss francs as a citizenship fee, because of the financial obligations incumbent on the municipality to grant the citizenship.\nA child born to two Swiss parents is automatically granted the citizenship of the parent whose last name they hold, so the child gets either the mother's or the father's place of origin. A child born to one Swiss parent and one foreign parent acquires the citizenship, and thus the place of origin, of the Swiss parent.\n\nInternational confusion\nAlmost uniquely in the world (with the exception of Japan, which lists one's Registered Domicile; and Sweden, which lists the mother's place of domicile as place of birth), the Swiss identity card, passport and driving licence do not show the holder's birthplace, but only their place of origin. The vast majority of countries show the holder's actual birthplace on identity documents. This can lead to administrative issues for Swiss citizens abroad when asked to demonstrate their actual place of birth, as no such information exists on any official Swiss identification documents. Only a minority of Swiss citizens have a place of origin identical to their birthplace. More confusion comes into play through the fact that people can have more than one place of origin.\n\nSignificance and history\nA citizen of a municipality does not enjoy a larger set of rights than a non-citizen of the same municipality. To vote in communal, cantonal or national matters, only the current place of residence matters \u2013 or in the case of citizens abroad, the last Swiss place of residence.\nThe law previously required that a citizen's place of origin continued to bear all their social welfare costs for two years after the citizen moved away. In 2012, the National Council voted by 151 to 9 votes to abolish this law. The place of domicile is now the sole payer of welfare costs.In 1923, 1937, 1959 and 1967, more cantons signed treaties that assured that the place of domicile had to pay welfare costs instead of the place of origin, reflecting the fact that fewer and fewer people lived in their place of origin (1860: 59%, in 1910: 34%).In 1681, the Tagsatzung \u2013 the then Swiss parliament \u2013 decided that beggars should be deported to their place of origin, especially if they were insufficiently cared for by their residential community.In the 19th century, Swiss municipalities even offered free emigration to the United States if the Swiss citizen agreed to renounce municipal citizenship, and with that the right to receive welfare.\n\nSee also\nAncestral home (Chinese)\nBon-gwan\nRegistered domicile\n\n\n== Notes and references ==\nPassage 6:\nValley of Death\nValley of Death may refer to:\n\nPlaces\nValley of Death (Bydgoszcz), the site of a 1939 Nazi mass murder and mass grave site in northern Poland\nValley of Death (Crimea), the site of the Charge of the Light Brigade in the 1854 Battle of Balaclava\nValley of Death (Gettysburg), the 1863 Gettysburg Battlefield landform of Plum Run\nValley of Death (Dukla Pass), the site of a tank battle during the Battle of the Dukla Pass in 1944 (World War II)\nThe Valley of Death, an area of poisonous volcanic gas near the Kikhpinych volcano in Russia\nThe Valley of Death, an area of poisonous volcanic gas near the Tangkuban Perahu volcano in Indonesia\nValley of Death, a nickname for the highly polluted city of Cubat\u00e3o, Brazil\n\nOther uses\nThe Valley of Death (audio drama), a Doctor Who audio play\nThe Valley of Death (film), a 1968 western film\n\"Valley of Death\", the flawed NewsStand: CNN & Time debut program that caused the Operation Tailwind controversy\nA literary element of \"The Charge of the Light Brigade\" by Alfred, Lord Tennyson\nA reference to the difficulty of covering negative cash flow in the early stages of a start-up company; see Venture capital\n\"The Valley of Death\", a song by the Swedish heavy metal band Sabaton from the 2022 album The War to End All Wars\n\nSee also\nAll pages with titles containing Valley of Death\nDeath Valley (disambiguation)\nValley of the Shadow of Death (disambiguation)\nPassage 7:\nBeaulieu-sur-Loire\nBeaulieu-sur-Loire (French pronunciation: \u200b[bolj\u00f8 sy\u0281 lwa\u0281], literally Beaulieu on Loire) is a commune in the Loiret department in north-central France.

Having begun his military career in the service of King Tabinshwehti, the youngest full brother of Bayinnaung was part of the small core group loyal to Bayinnaung, following the assassination of Tabinshwehti in 1550. Alongside his brothers Bayinnaung, Minye Sithu, Minkhaung II, Thado Minsaw and his nephew Nanda, he fought in nearly every campaign between 1550 and 1584 that rebuilt, expanded and defended the Toungoo Empire.\n\nEarly life\nHe was born in the Toungoo Palace precincts to Mingyi Swe and Shin Myo Myat, royal household servants of Crown Prince Tabinshwehti. He had an elder sister, Dhamma Dewi, two elder brothers, Bayinnaung and Minye Sithu, and two younger half-brothers, Minkhaung II and Thado Minsaw who were born to his aunt (his mother's younger sister) and his father. He grew up in the palace precincts, and received a military-style education there.\n\nCareer\nTabinshwehti era (1534\u20131550)\nHe participated in the Toungoo\u2013Hanthawaddy War (1534\u20131541), and by 1540 had achieved the rank of regimental commander with the style of Nanda Yawda (\u1014\u1014\u1039\u1012\u101a\u1031\u102c\u103a\u1013\u102c). He was appointed governor of Thamyindon (\u101e\u1019\u103c\u1004\u103a\u1038\u1010\u102f\u1036) in the Irrawaddy delta in 1541 by Tabinshwehti. He served as a regimental commander in Toungoo's campaigns against Prome (1541\u20131542), led a naval squadron in the Arakan campaign (1546\u20131547), and commanded an elephant battalion in the invasion of Siam (1548\u20131549). In January 1550, he joined his brothers Bayinnaung and Minye Sithu on the campaign to suppress the rebellion of Smim Htaw.\n\nBayinnaung era (1550\u20131581)\nHe was a key member of Bayinnaung's drive to restore the Toungoo Empire which had fallen apart after Tabinshwehti was assassinated on 30 April 1550. He led a regiment in Bayinnaung's 1550\u20131551 assault on the city of Toungoo, whose ruler Minkhaung II was their own half-brother. He was given a royal title of Thado Dhamma Yaza on 11 January 1551 by Bayinnaung after Minkhaung II surrendered and was pardoned on the same day. He commanded the Irrawaddy flank in the Prome campaign (March\u2013August 1551). Prome was taken on 30 August 1551, and Bayinnaung appointed him as the viceroy of Prome.Thado Dhamma Yaza II was one of the four deputies of Bayinnaung in the king's campaigns between 1552 and 1565 that greatly expanded the Toungoo Empire. The original four were Bayinnaung's four brothers: Minye Sithu, Thado Dhamma Yaza, Minkhaung and Thado Minsaw. After Minye Sithu's death in 1556, Bayinnaung's eldest son Nanda took his place. Thado Dhamma Yaza participated in every campaign except for Manipur (1560) and Lan Xang (1565). Bayinnaung had built the largest empire in the history of Southeast Asia. After a brief respite, he faced serious rebellions in Lan Xang and Siam in 1568, later joined by northern Shan states in the 1570s. Thado Dhamma Yaza along with the other three deputies of the king were called upon to suppress the rebellions.The following is a list of campaigns in which he participated during the reign of Bayinnaung.\n\nHe proved to be a loyal brother. He built the Prome gate of Pegu (Bago) when the capital was rebuilt between 1565 and 1568. (Each of the twenty gates of the new capital was built by key vassal rulers.) For their loyal service, Thado Dhamma Yaza II, Minkhaung II and Thado Minsaw were all honored by their brother the king on 3 March 1580.\n\nNanda era (1581\u20131588)\nBayinnaung died on 10 October 1581, and was succeeded by his son Nanda. The new king faced an impossible task of maintaining an empire ruled by autonomous viceroys who were loyal to Bayinnaung, not the kingdom of Toungoo. Nanda particularly distrusted his uncle Thado Minsaw of Ava. When two Chinese Shan states Sanda and Thaungthut revolted in August/September 1582, the high king asked Thado Dhamma Yaza II and Nawrahta Minsaw of Lan Na to lead two 8000-strong armies to quell the rebellion. (The king conspicuously did not ask Thado Minsaw to take part in the campaign although Ava contributed troops and the Shan states were closer to Ava.) The two armies laid siege to Sanda (present-day Baoshan prefecture) for nearly five months until the starving city surrendered. The armies arrived back to Pegu in April 1583.Nanda's slight of Thado Minsaw did not go unnoticed. In June/July 1583, Thado Minsaw sent secret embassies to Prome, Toungoo and Chiang Mai to launch a simultaneous revolt against Nanda. He also sent missions to Shan states for their support. Thado Dhamma Yaza and the other viceroys sided with Nanda. When Nanda marched to Ava in March 1584, he along with the rulers of Toungoo and Chiang Mai also marched to Ava. Ava turned out to be Thado Dhamma Yaza's last campaign. He did not participate in the ensuing campaigns against Siam, which revolted in May 1584.\nThado Dhamma Yaza II died in November/December 1588. He was succeeded by Mingyi Hnaung, one of Nanda's sons, styled as Thado Dhamma Yaza III of Prome.\n\nFamily\nHis chief queen was Salin Mibaya, who was a daughter of King Bayin Htwe of Prome and a descendant of Ava royalty. They were married in 1545 in Pegu at the coronation ceremony of Tabinshwehti. He had two daughters by his chief queen. The elder daughter Hsinbyushin Medaw became the chief queen of Nawrahta Minsaw, the viceroy (and later king) of Lan Na. The younger daughter Min Taya Medaw was a major queen of Nanda.He also had seven sons and a daughter by minor queens and concubines. They were:\nNanda Yawda (birth name Shin Zin), who married his first cousin Myat Myo Hpone Wai (daughter of Bayinnaung) and became governor of Sagaing.

This place is often used in legal documents, together with name and date of birth, to uniquely identify a person. Practice regarding whether this place should be a country, a territory or a city/town/locality differs in different countries, but often city or territory is used for native-born citizen passports and countries for foreign-born ones.\nAs a general rule with respect to passports, if the place of birth is to be a country, it's determined to be the country that currently has sovereignty over the actual place of birth, regardless of when the birth actually occurred. The place of birth is not necessarily the place where the parents of the new baby live. If the baby is born in a hospital in another place, that place is the place of birth. In many countries, this also means that the government requires that the birth of the new baby is registered in the place of birth.\nSome countries place less or no importance on the place of birth, instead using alternative geographical characteristics for the purpose of identity documents. For example, Sweden has used the concept of f\u00f6delsehemort (\"domicile of birth\") since 1947. This means that the domicile of the baby's mother is the registered place of birth. The location of the maternity ward or other physical birthplace is considered unimportant.\nSimilarly, Switzerland uses the concept of place of origin. A child born to Swiss parents is automatically assigned the place of origin of the parent with the same last name, so the child either gets their mother's or father's place of origin. A child born to one Swiss parent and one foreign parent acquires the place of origin of their Swiss parent. In a Swiss passport and identity card, the holder's place of origin is stated, not their place of birth. In Japan, the registered domicile is a similar concept.\nIn some countries (primarily in the Americas), the place of birth automatically determines the nationality of the baby, a practice often referred to by the Latin phrase jus soli. Almost all countries outside the Americas instead attribute nationality based on the nationality(-ies) of the baby's parents (referred to as jus sanguinis).\nThere can be some confusion regarding the place of birth if the birth takes place in an unusual way: when babies are born on an airplane or at sea, difficulties can arise. The place of birth of such a person depends on the law of the countries involved, which include the nationality of the plane or ship, the nationality(-ies) of the parents and/or the location of the plane or ship (if the birth occurs in the territorial waters or airspace of a country).\nSome administrative forms may request the applicant's \"country of birth\". It is important to determine from the requester whether the information requested refers to the applicant's \"place of birth\" or \"nationality at birth\". For example, US citizens born abroad who acquire US citizenship at the time of birth, the nationality at birth will be USA (American), while the place of birth would be the country in which the actual birth takes place.\n\nReference list\n8 FAM 403.4 Place of Birth\n\nAnswer the question based on the given passages.

Her marriage to her first cousin Min Ba Saw\u2014a son of her maternal uncle\u2014was cut short when her brother King Narapati had him executed. Narapati then married her off to Sithu Kyawhtin, then governor of Salin, a powerful figure in the Confederation of Shan States, in a marriage of state in the late 1530s. (Prome was then a de facto vassal state of the Confederation, which controlled all of Ava territories except Toungoo in Upper Burma.) Her stay at Salin lasted until January 1544 when the city was captured by Toungoo forces under Gen. Bayinnaung. Her husband escaped to Ava (Inwa) but she was captured and sent to Pegu (Bago). In 1545, she was married to Nanda Yawda, a younger brother of Bayinnaung, at the coronation ceremony of Tabinshwehti at the Pegu Palace.She returned to her native Prome as queen in 1551 when her husband was appointed viceroy of the region by King Bayinnaung. She had two daughters by Nanda Yawda, now styled as Thado Dhamma Yaza II. Their elder daughter Hsinbyushin Medaw became the chief queen of Nawrahta Minsaw, the viceroy (and later king) of Lan Na. The younger daughter Min Taya Medaw was a major queen of Nanda.\n\nAncestry\nThe following is her ancestry as reported in the Hmannan Yazawin chronicle, which in turn referenced contemporary inscriptions.

It is not to be confused with the place of birth or  place of residence, although two or all three of these locations may be identical depending on the person's circumstances.\n\nAcquisition of municipal citizenship\nSwiss citizenship has three tiers.

The place of domicile is now the sole payer of welfare costs.In 1923, 1937, 1959 and 1967, more cantons signed treaties that assured that the place of domicile had to pay welfare costs instead of the place of origin, reflecting the fact that fewer and fewer people lived in their place of origin (1860: 59%, in 1910: 34%).In 1681, the Tagsatzung \u2013 the then Swiss parliament \u2013 decided that beggars should be deported to their place of origin, especially if they were insufficiently cared for by their residential community.In the 19th century, Swiss municipalities even offered free emigration to the United States if the Swiss citizen agreed to renounce municipal citizenship, and with that the right to receive welfare.\n\nSee also\nAncestral home (Chinese)\nBon-gwan\nRegistered domicile\n\n\n== Notes and references ==\nPassage 6:\nValley of Death\nValley of Death may refer to:\n\nPlaces\nValley of Death (Bydgoszcz), the site of a 1939 Nazi mass murder and mass grave site in northern Poland\nValley of Death (Crimea), the site of the Charge of the Light Brigade in the 1854 Battle of Balaclava\nValley of Death (Gettysburg), the 1863 Gettysburg Battlefield landform of Plum Run\nValley of Death (Dukla Pass), the site of a tank battle during the Battle of the Dukla Pass in 1944 (World War II)\nThe Valley of Death, an area of poisonous volcanic gas near the Kikhpinych volcano in Russia\nThe Valley of Death, an area of poisonous volcanic gas near the Tangkuban Perahu volcano in Indonesia\nValley of Death, a nickname for the highly polluted city of Cubat\u00e3o, Brazil\n\nOther uses\nThe Valley of Death (audio drama), a Doctor Who audio play\nThe Valley of Death (film), a 1968 western film\n\"Valley of Death\", the flawed NewsStand: CNN & Time debut program that caused the Operation Tailwind controversy\nA literary element of \"The Charge of the Light Brigade\" by Alfred, Lord Tennyson\nA reference to the difficulty of covering negative cash flow in the early stages of a start-up company; see Venture capital\n\"The Valley of Death\", a song by the Swedish heavy metal band Sabaton from the 2022 album The War to End All Wars\n\nSee also\nAll pages with titles containing Valley of Death\nDeath Valley (disambiguation)\nValley of the Shadow of Death (disambiguation)\nPassage 7:\nBeaulieu-sur-Loire\nBeaulieu-sur-Loire (French pronunciation: \u200b[bolj\u00f8 sy\u0281 lwa\u0281], literally Beaulieu on Loire) is a commune in the Loiret department in north-central France.

Having begun his military career in the service of King Tabinshwehti, the youngest full brother of Bayinnaung was part of the small core group loyal to Bayinnaung, following the assassination of Tabinshwehti in 1550. Alongside his brothers Bayinnaung, Minye Sithu, Minkhaung II, Thado Minsaw and his nephew Nanda, he fought in nearly every campaign between 1550 and 1584 that rebuilt, expanded and defended the Toungoo Empire.\n\nEarly life\nHe was born in the Toungoo Palace precincts to Mingyi Swe and Shin Myo Myat, royal household servants of Crown Prince Tabinshwehti. He had an elder sister, Dhamma Dewi, two elder brothers, Bayinnaung and Minye Sithu, and two younger half-brothers, Minkhaung II and Thado Minsaw who were born to his aunt (his mother's younger sister) and his father. He grew up in the palace precincts, and received a military-style education there.\n\nCareer\nTabinshwehti era (1534\u20131550)\nHe participated in the Toungoo\u2013Hanthawaddy War (1534\u20131541), and by 1540 had achieved the rank of regimental commander with the style of Nanda Yawda (\u1014\u1014\u1039\u1012\u101a\u1031\u102c\u103a\u1013\u102c). He was appointed governor of Thamyindon (\u101e\u1019\u103c\u1004\u103a\u1038\u1010\u102f\u1036) in the Irrawaddy delta in 1541 by Tabinshwehti. He served as a regimental commander in Toungoo's campaigns against Prome (1541\u20131542), led a naval squadron in the Arakan campaign (1546\u20131547), and commanded an elephant battalion in the invasion of Siam (1548\u20131549). In January 1550, he joined his brothers Bayinnaung and Minye Sithu on the campaign to suppress the rebellion of Smim Htaw.\n\nBayinnaung era (1550\u20131581)\nHe was a key member of Bayinnaung's drive to restore the Toungoo Empire which had fallen apart after Tabinshwehti was assassinated on 30 April 1550. He led a regiment in Bayinnaung's 1550\u20131551 assault on the city of Toungoo, whose ruler Minkhaung II was their own half-brother. He was given a royal title of Thado Dhamma Yaza on 11 January 1551 by Bayinnaung after Minkhaung II surrendered and was pardoned on the same day. He commanded the Irrawaddy flank in the Prome campaign (March\u2013August 1551). Prome was taken on 30 August 1551, and Bayinnaung appointed him as the viceroy of Prome.Thado Dhamma Yaza II was one of the four deputies of Bayinnaung in the king's campaigns between 1552 and 1565 that greatly expanded the Toungoo Empire. The original four were Bayinnaung's four brothers: Minye Sithu, Thado Dhamma Yaza, Minkhaung and Thado Minsaw. After Minye Sithu's death in 1556, Bayinnaung's eldest son Nanda took his place. Thado Dhamma Yaza participated in every campaign except for Manipur (1560) and Lan Xang (1565). Bayinnaung had built the largest empire in the history of Southeast Asia. After a brief respite, he faced serious rebellions in Lan Xang and Siam in 1568, later joined by northern Shan states in the 1570s. Thado Dhamma Yaza along with the other three deputies of the king were called upon to suppress the rebellions.The following is a list of campaigns in which he participated during the reign of Bayinnaung.\n\nHe proved to be a loyal brother. He built the Prome gate of Pegu (Bago) when the capital was rebuilt between 1565 and 1568. (Each of the twenty gates of the new capital was built by key vassal rulers.) For their loyal service, Thado Dhamma Yaza II, Minkhaung II and Thado Minsaw were all honored by their brother the king on 3 March 1580.\n\nNanda era (1581\u20131588)\nBayinnaung died on 10 October 1581, and was succeeded by his son Nanda. The new king faced an impossible task of maintaining an empire ruled by autonomous viceroys who were loyal to Bayinnaung, not the kingdom of Toungoo. Nanda particularly distrusted his uncle Thado Minsaw of Ava. When two Chinese Shan states Sanda and Thaungthut revolted in August/September 1582, the high king asked Thado Dhamma Yaza II and Nawrahta Minsaw of Lan Na to lead two 8000-strong armies to quell the rebellion. (The king conspicuously did not ask Thado Minsaw to take part in the campaign although Ava contributed troops and the Shan states were closer to Ava.) The two armies laid siege to Sanda (present-day Baoshan prefecture) for nearly five months until the starving city surrendered. The armies arrived back to Pegu in April 1583.Nanda's slight of Thado Minsaw did not go unnoticed. In June/July 1583, Thado Minsaw sent secret embassies to Prome, Toungoo and Chiang Mai to launch a simultaneous revolt against Nanda. He also sent missions to Shan states for their support. Thado Dhamma Yaza and the other viceroys sided with Nanda. When Nanda marched to Ava in March 1584, he along with the rulers of Toungoo and Chiang Mai also marched to Ava. Ava turned out to be Thado Dhamma Yaza's last campaign. He did not participate in the ensuing campaigns against Siam, which revolted in May 1584.\nThado Dhamma Yaza II died in November/December 1588. He was succeeded by Mingyi Hnaung, one of Nanda's sons, styled as Thado Dhamma Yaza III of Prome.\n\nFamily\nHis chief queen was Salin Mibaya, who was a daughter of King Bayin Htwe of Prome and a descendant of Ava royalty. They were married in 1545 in Pegu at the coronation ceremony of Tabinshwehti. He had two daughters by his chief queen. The elder daughter Hsinbyushin Medaw became the chief queen of Nawrahta Minsaw, the viceroy (and later king) of Lan Na. The younger daughter Min Taya Medaw was a major queen of Nanda.He also had seven sons and a daughter by minor queens and concubines. They were:\nNanda Yawda (birth name Shin Zin), who married his first cousin Myat Myo Hpone Wai (daughter of Bayinnaung) and became governor of Sagaing.

This place is often used in legal documents, together with name and date of birth, to uniquely identify a person. Practice regarding whether this place should be a country, a territory or a city/town/locality differs in different countries, but often city or territory is used for native-born citizen passports and countries for foreign-born ones.\nAs a general rule with respect to passports, if the place of birth is to be a country, it's determined to be the country that currently has sovereignty over the actual place of birth, regardless of when the birth actually occurred. The place of birth is not necessarily the place where the parents of the new baby live. If the baby is born in a hospital in another place, that place is the place of birth. In many countries, this also means that the government requires that the birth of the new baby is registered in the place of birth.\nSome countries place less or no importance on the place of birth, instead using alternative geographical characteristics for the purpose of identity documents. For example, Sweden has used the concept of f\u00f6delsehemort (\"domicile of birth\") since 1947. This means that the domicile of the baby's mother is the registered place of birth. The location of the maternity ward or other physical birthplace is considered unimportant.\nSimilarly, Switzerland uses the concept of place of origin. A child born to Swiss parents is automatically assigned the place of origin of the parent with the same last name, so the child either gets their mother's or father's place of origin. A child born to one Swiss parent and one foreign parent acquires the place of origin of their Swiss parent. In a Swiss passport and identity card, the holder's place of origin is stated, not their place of birth. In Japan, the registered domicile is a similar concept.\nIn some countries (primarily in the Americas), the place of birth automatically determines the nationality of the baby, a practice often referred to by the Latin phrase jus soli. Almost all countries outside the Americas instead attribute nationality based on the nationality(-ies) of the baby's parents (referred to as jus sanguinis).\nThere can be some confusion regarding the place of birth if the birth takes place in an unusual way: when babies are born on an airplane or at sea, difficulties can arise. The place of birth of such a person depends on the law of the countries involved, which include the nationality of the plane or ship, the nationality(-ies) of the parents and/or the location of the plane or ship (if the birth occurs in the territorial waters or airspace of a country).\nSome administrative forms may request the applicant's \"country of birth\". It is important to determine from the requester whether the information requested refers to the applicant's \"place of birth\" or \"nationality at birth\". For example, US citizens born abroad who acquire US citizenship at the time of birth, the nationality at birth will be USA (American), while the place of birth would be the country in which the actual birth takes place.\n\nReference list\n8 FAM 403.4 Place of Birth", "answers": ["Pyay"], "length": 3817, "dataset": "2wikimqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "3cd55b0826fed3ba2514f1f3477412ceb1d54c958b74d2a1", "pred": " Salin."}

Mithoon received the Filmfare Award for Best Music Director, and in 2014 received a nomination for Filmfare Award for Best Lyricist in the 59th Filmfare Awards. He wrote and composed one of the most streamed Hindi songs on YouTube, \"Sanam Re\". The song was honoured with the award of \"Most Streamed Song of 2016\" at the Global Indian Music Academy Awards.\nMithoon launched the talented singer Arijit Singh in 2011 with Mohammad Irfan Ali co-singer in his hit song Phir Mohabbat.\n\nEarly life\nMithoon was born into a family of musicians. His grandfather, Pandit Ram Prasad Sharma, imparted music knowledge to thousands of aspirants, many of whom are amongst today's top musicians. His father, Naresh Sharma, was a leading expert of musical arrangements, having worked with almost all of the top composers in more than two hundred movies. Mithoon's father and his uncle Pyarelal-ji (Pyarelal Ramprasad Sharma) formed one-half of the legendary composer duo Laxmikant-Pyarelal.Mithoon started learning music at the age of eleven. Since his father remained busy, he sent him to knowledgeable people to train himself. His father observed him closely and would often notice what he was practicing. His father often listened to the tunes that he created as well. On 6 November 2022, he married playback singer Palak Muchhal.\n\nCareer\nMithoon began his career with two recreations: \"Woh Lamhe\" in Zeher and \"Aadat\" in Kalyug. In 2006, Mithoon's friend recommended his name to Onir, (director of Bas Ek Pal), who wanted an electro-based title track. This led to his first original song as a composer, \"Bas Ek Pal\" with singer KK, and was followed by \"Tere Bin\" (by singer Atif Aslam) in 2006. Both songs were included in the film Bas Ek Pal. .He wrote the score for Anwar, released in 2007 and his compositions Tose Naina Lage and Maula Mere are still extremely popular.\nHe also worked as a guest composer for songs on several nonmovie albums, such as \"Kuch Is Tarah\" from Atif Aslam's album Doorie, and Abhijeet Sawant's and \"Ek Shaqs\" from the Abhijeet Sawant album Junoon.

He was an innovative composer of instrumental music as well as songs, and was the composer of the earliest surviving music for the guitar.\n\nBiography\nThe place of his birth is not recorded, but he grew up in Guadalajara, and probably received his musical training there.  He most likely went to Italy in 1529 with Charles V, in the company of the fourth Duke of the Infantado, \u00cd\u00f1igo L\u00f3pez de Mendoza, marqu\u00e9s de Santillana.  When he returned to Spain he became a priest, receiving the post of canon at the cathedral in Seville in 1546, where he remained for the rest of his life.  While at the cathedral, he directed all of the musical activities; many records remain of his musical activities there, which included hiring instrumentalists, buying and assembling a new organ, and working closely with composer Francisco Guerrero for various festivities.  Mudarra died in Seville, and his sizable fortune was distributed to the poor of the city according to his will.\n\nMudarra wrote numerous pieces for the vihuela and the four-course guitar, all contained in the collection Tres libros de musica en cifras para vihuela (\"Three books of music in numbers for vihuela\"), which he published on December 7, 1546 in Seville.  These three books contain the first music ever published for the four-course guitar, which was then a relatively new instrument. The second book is noteworthy in that it contains eight multi-movement works, all arranged by \"tono\", or mode.\nCompositions represented in this publication include fantasias, variations (including a set on La Folia), tientos, pavanes and galliards, and songs. Modern listeners are probably most familiar with his Fantasia X, which has been a concert and recording mainstay for many years.   The songs are in Latin, Spanish and Italian, and include romances, canciones (songs), villancicos, (popular songs) and sonetos (sonnets).  Another innovation was the use of different signs for different tempos:  slow, medium, and fast.\n\nReferences and further reading\nJohn Griffiths: \"Alonso Mudarra\", Grove Music Online ed. L.

Shivaay begs her to give him the child, after which he will not stop her. 9 years later, Shivaay leads a happy life with his mute daughter Gaura until she discovers that Olga is still alive and in Bulgaria. Gaura insists Shivaay to take her to Bulgaria. Despite his old sorrows, Shivaay finally agrees to take her to Bulgaria, where he saves a young child from child traffickers. Shivaay seeks the Indian embassy's help in tracing Olga and is assigned to Anushka. Led by crime baron Ustinov and his right-hand man Changez, the traffickers kidnap Gaura. \nShivaay chases the van, destroying various cars, but loses the van and is arrested by the Bulgarian police, charged with murder and trafficking. While in the police van, Shivaay imagines the officers in the van to be the same masked traffickers, where he attacks them, throwing out every single officer. The van accidentally falls off a dam and the police think that Shivaay is dead, but Shivaay escapes by jumping from the van due to his skills and survives. Shivaay brings one of the saved prostitutes from a brothel to Anushka's home to help her out. Anushka, who misunderstood Shivaay earlier, agrees to help him.

His grandfather, Pandit Ram Prasad Sharma, imparted music knowledge to thousands of aspirants, many of whom are amongst today's top musicians. His father, Naresh Sharma, was a leading expert of musical arrangements, having worked with almost all of the top composers in more than two hundred movies. Mithoon's father and his uncle Pyarelal-ji (Pyarelal Ramprasad Sharma) formed one-half of the legendary composer duo Laxmikant-Pyarelal.Mithoon started learning music at the age of eleven. Since his father remained busy, he sent him to knowledgeable people to train himself. His father observed him closely and would often notice what he was practicing. His father often listened to the tunes that he created as well. On 6 November 2022, he married playback singer Palak Muchhal.\n\nCareer\nMithoon began his career with two recreations: \"Woh Lamhe\" in Zeher and \"Aadat\" in Kalyug. In 2006, Mithoon's friend recommended his name to Onir, (director of Bas Ek Pal), who wanted an electro-based title track. This led to his first original song as a composer, \"Bas Ek Pal\" with singer KK, and was followed by \"Tere Bin\" (by singer Atif Aslam) in 2006. Both songs were included in the film Bas Ek Pal. .He wrote the score for Anwar, released in 2007 and his compositions Tose Naina Lage and Maula Mere are still extremely popular.\nHe also worked as a guest composer for songs on several nonmovie albums, such as \"Kuch Is Tarah\" from Atif Aslam's album Doorie, and Abhijeet Sawant's and \"Ek Shaqs\" from the Abhijeet Sawant album Junoon. He released his own album, Tu Hi Mere Rab Ki Tarah Hai in 2009 with T-Series. For this album, Mithoon traveled to the United Kingdom to rope in musicians. There, he worked with musicians of the Philharmonic Orchestra.In 2011 he composed two songs \"Aye Khuda\", \"Phir Mohabbat\" for the film Murder 2  which also marked the debut of Arijit Singh.\nThe song \"Tum Hi Ho\" which he wrote for Aashiqui 2, and \"O saathi\" from the movie Shab became popular.

He was an innovative composer of instrumental music as well as songs, and was the composer of the earliest surviving music for the guitar.\n\nBiography\nThe place of his birth is not recorded, but he grew up in Guadalajara, and probably received his musical training there.  He most likely went to Italy in 1529 with Charles V, in the company of the fourth Duke of the Infantado, \u00cd\u00f1igo L\u00f3pez de Mendoza, marqu\u00e9s de Santillana.  When he returned to Spain he became a priest, receiving the post of canon at the cathedral in Seville in 1546, where he remained for the rest of his life.  While at the cathedral, he directed all of the musical activities; many records remain of his musical activities there, which included hiring instrumentalists, buying and assembling a new organ, and working closely with composer Francisco Guerrero for various festivities.  Mudarra died in Seville, and his sizable fortune was distributed to the poor of the city according to his will.\n\nMudarra wrote numerous pieces for the vihuela and the four-course guitar, all contained in the collection Tres libros de musica en cifras para vihuela (\"Three books of music in numbers for vihuela\"), which he published on December 7, 1546 in Seville.  These three books contain the first music ever published for the four-course guitar, which was then a relatively new instrument. The second book is noteworthy in that it contains eight multi-movement works, all arranged by \"tono\", or mode.\nCompositions represented in this publication include fantasias, variations (including a set on La Folia), tientos, pavanes and galliards, and songs. Modern listeners are probably most familiar with his Fantasia X, which has been a concert and recording mainstay for many years.   The songs are in Latin, Spanish and Italian, and include romances, canciones (songs), villancicos, (popular songs) and sonetos (sonnets).  Another innovation was the use of different signs for different tempos:  slow, medium, and fast.\n\nReferences and further reading\nJohn Griffiths: \"Alonso Mudarra\", Grove Music Online ed. L.

Only uncertain and contradictory information is available about her early life. Said to have been born on 15 April 1684 (o.s. 5 April), she was originally named Marta Helena Skowro\u0144ska. Marta was the daughter of Samuel Skowro\u0144ski (later spelled Samuil Skavronsky), a Roman Catholic farmer from the eastern parts of the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth, born to Minsker parents. In 1680 he married Dorothea Hahn at Jakobstadt. Her mother is named in at least one source as Elizabeth Moritz, the daughter of a Baltic German woman and there is debate as to whether Moritz's father was a Swedish officer. It is likely that two stories were conflated, and Swedish sources suggest that the Elizabeth Moritz story is probably incorrect. Some biographies state that Marta's father was a gravedigger and handyman, while others speculate that he was a runaway landless serf.\nMarta's parents died of the plague around 1689, leaving five children. According to one of the popular versions, at the age of three Marta was taken by an aunt and sent to Marienburg (the present-day Al\u016bksne in Latvia, near the border with Estonia and Russia) where she was raised by Johann Ernst Gl\u00fcck, a Lutheran pastor and educator who was the first to translate the Bible into Latvian. In his household she served as a lowly servant, likely either a scullery maid or washerwoman.  No effort was made to teach her to read and write and she remained illiterate throughout her life.\nMarta was considered a very beautiful young girl, and there are accounts that Frau Gl\u00fcck became fearful that she would become involved with her son. At the age of seventeen, she was married off to a Swedish dragoon, Johan Cruse or Johann Rabbe, with whom she remained for eight days in 1702, at which point the Swedish troops were withdrawn from Marienburg. When Russian forces captured the town, Pastor Gl\u00fcck offered to work as a translator, and Field Marshal Boris Sheremetev agreed to his proposal and took him to Moscow.\nThere are unsubstantiated stories that Marta worked briefly in the laundry of the victorious regiment, and also that she was presented in her undergarments to Brigadier General Rudolph Felix Bauer, later the Governor of Estonia, to be his mistress. She may have worked in the household of his superior, Sheremetev. It is not known whether she was his mistress, or household maid.  She travelled back to the Russian court with Sheremetev's army.Afterwards she became part of the household of Prince Alexander Menshikov, who was the best friend of Peter the Great of Russia. Anecdotal sources suggest that she was purchased by him. Whether the two of them were lovers is disputed, as Menshikov was already engaged to Darya Arsenyeva, his future wife. It is clear that Menshikov and Marta formed a lifetime alliance.\nIt is possible that Menshikov, who was quite jealous of Peter's attentions and knew his tastes, wanted to procure a mistress on whom he could rely. In any case, in 1703, while visiting Menshikov at his home, Peter met Marta. In 1704, she was well established in the Tsar's household as his mistress, and gave birth to a son, Peter. In 1703, she converted to Orthodoxy and took the new name Catherine Alexeyevna (Yekaterina Alexeyevna). She and Darya Menshikova accompanied Peter and Menshikov on their military excursions.\n\nMarriage and family life\nThough no record exists, Catherine and Peter are described as having married secretly between 23 October and 1 December 1707 in Saint Petersburg. They had twelve children, two of whom survived into adulthood, Anna (born 1708) and Elizabeth (born 1709).\nPeter had moved the capital to St. Petersburg in 1703. While the city was being built he lived in a three-room log cabin with Catherine, where she did the cooking and caring for the children, and he tended a garden as though they were an ordinary couple. The relationship was the most successful of Peter's life and a great number of letters exist demonstrating the strong affection between Catherine and Peter. As a person she was very energetic, compassionate, charming, and always cheerful. She was able to calm Peter in his frequent rages and was often called in to do so.\nCatherine went with Peter on his Pruth Campaign in 1711. There, she was said to have saved Peter and his Empire, as related by Voltaire in his book Peter the Great. Surrounded by overwhelming numbers of Turkish troops, Catherine suggested before surrendering, that her jewels and those of the other women be used in an effort to bribe the Ottoman grand vizier Baltac\u0131 Mehmet Pasha into allowing a retreat.\nMehmet allowed the retreat, whether motivated by the bribe or considerations of trade and diplomacy. In any case Peter credited Catherine and proceeded to marry her again (this time officially) at Saint Isaac's Cathedral in St. Petersburg on 9 February 1712.  She was Peter's second wife; he had previously married and divorced Eudoxia Lopukhina, who had borne him the Tsarevich Alexis Petrovich. Upon their wedding, Catherine took on the style of her husband and became Tsarina. When Peter elevated the Russian Tsardom to Empire, Catherine became Empress. The Order of Saint Catherine was instituted by her husband on the occasion of their wedding.\n\nIssue\nCatherine and Peter had twelve children, all of whom died in childhood except Anna and Elizabeth:\n\nPeter Petrovich (1704\u20131707), died in infancy\nPaul Petrovich (October 1705\u20131707), died in infancy\nCatherine Petrovna (7 February 1707\u20137 August 1708)\nGrand Duchess Anna Petrovna (27 January 1708\u201315 May 1728)\nGrand Duchess Elizabeth Petrovna (29 December 1709\u20135 January 1762)\nGrand Duchess Mary Natalia Petrovna (20 March 1713\u201317 May 1715)\nGrand Duchess Margaret Petrovna (19 September 1714\u20137 June 1715)\nGrand Duke Peter Petrovich (9 November 1715\u20136 May 1719)\n\nGrand Duke Paul Petrovich (13 January 1717\u201314 January 1717)\nGrand Duchess Natalia Petrovna (31 August 1718\u201315 March 1725)\nGrand Duke Peter Petrovich (7 October 1723\u20137 October 1723)\nGrand Duke Paul Petrovich (1724\u20131724)\n\nSiblings\nUpon Peter's death, Catherine found her four siblings, Krystyna, Anna, Karol, and Fryderyk, gave them the newly created titles of Count and Countess, and brought them to Russia.\n\nKrystyna Skowro\u0144ska, renamed Christina (Russian: \u0425\u0440\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0430) Samuilovna Skavronskaya (1687\u201314 April 1729), had married Simon Heinrich (Russian: \u0421\u0438\u043c\u043e\u043d \u0413\u0435\u0439\u043d\u0440\u0438\u0445) (1672\u20131728) and their descendants became the Counts Gendrikov.\nAnna Skowro\u0144ska, renamed Anna Samuilovna Skavronskaya, had married one Michael-Joachim N and their descendants became the Counts Efimovsky.\nKarol Skowro\u0144ski, renamed Karel Samuilovich Skavronsky, was created a Count of the Russian Empire on 5 January 1727 and made a Chamberlain of the Imperial Court; he had married Maria Ivanovna, a Russian woman, by whom he had descendants who became extinct in the male line with the death of Count Paul Martinovich Skavronskyi (1757-1793), father of Princess Catherine Bagration.\nFryderyk Skowro\u0144ski, renamed Feodor Samuilovich Skavronsky, was created a Count of the Russian Empire on 5 January 1727 and was married twice: to N, a Lithuanian woman, and to Ekaterina Rodionovna Saburova, without having children by either of them.\n\nReign as empress regnant\nCatherine was crowned in 1724. The year before his death, Peter and Catherine had an estrangement over her support of Willem Mons, brother of Peter's former mistress Anna, and brother to one of the current ladies in waiting for Catherine, Matryona. He served as Catherine's secretary. Peter had fought his entire life to clear up corruption in Russia. Catherine had a great deal of influence over who could gain access to her husband. Willem Mons and his sister Matryona had begun selling their influence to those who wanted access to Catherine and, through her, to Peter. Apparently this had been overlooked by Catherine, who was fond of both. Peter found out and had Willem Mons executed and his sister Matryona exiled. He and Catherine did not speak for several months. Rumors flew that she and Mons had had an affair, but there is no evidence for this.\nPeter died (28 January 1725 Old Style) without naming a successor. Catherine represented the interests of the \"new men\", commoners who had been brought to positions of great power by Peter based on competence. A change of government was likely to favor the entrenched aristocrats. For that reason during a meeting of a council to decide on a successor, a coup was arranged by Menshikov and others in which the guards regiments with whom Catherine was very popular proclaimed her the ruler of Russia. Supporting evidence was \"produced\" from Peter's secretary Makarov and the Bishop of Pskov, both \"new men\" with motivation to see Catherine take over. The real power, however, lay with Menshikov, Peter Tolstoy, and other members of the Supreme Privy Council.\nCatherine viewed the deposed empress Eudoxia as a threat, so she secretly moved her to Shlisselburg Fortress near St. Petersburg to be put in a secret prison under strict custody as a state prisoner.\n\nDeath\nCatherine I died two years after Peter I, on 17 May 1727 at age 43, in St. Petersburg, where she was buried at St. Peter and St. Paul Fortress. Tuberculosis, diagnosed as an abscess of the lungs, caused her early demise.\nBefore her death she recognized Peter II, the grandson of Peter I and Eudoxia, as her successor.\n\nAssessment and legacy\nCatherine was the first woman to rule Imperial Russia, opening the legal path for a century almost entirely dominated by women, including her daughter Elizabeth and granddaughter-in-law Catherine the Great, all of whom continued Peter the Great's policies in modernizing Russia.  At the time of Peter's death the Russian Army, composed of 130,000 men and supplemented by another 100,000 Cossacks, was easily the largest in Europe.  However, the expense of the military was proving ruinous to the Russian economy, consuming some 65% of the government's annual revenue.  Since the nation was at peace, Catherine was determined to reduce military expenditure.  For most of her reign, Catherine I was controlled by her advisers.  However, on this single issue, the reduction of military expenses, Catherine was able to have her way.  The resulting tax relief on the peasantry led to the reputation of Catherine I as a just and fair ruler.The Supreme Privy Council concentrated power in the hands of one party, and thus was an executive innovation. In foreign affairs, Russia reluctantly joined the Austro-Spanish league to defend the interests of Catherine's son-in-law, the Duke of Holstein, against Great Britain.\nCatherine gave her name to Catherinehof near St. Petersburg, and built the first bridges in the new capital. She was also the first royal owner of the Tsarskoye Selo estate, where the Catherine Palace still bears her name.\nThe city of Yekaterinburg is named after her, Yekaterina being the Russian form of her name.\nShe also gave her name to the Kadriorg Palace (German: Katharinental, meaning \"Catherine's Valley\"), its adjacent Kadriorg Park and the later Kadriorg neighbourhood of Tallinn, Estonia, which today houses the Presidential Palace of Estonia. The name of the neighbourhood is also used as a metonym for the institution of the President.\nIn general, Catherine's policies were reasonable and cautious.  The story of her humble origins was considered by later generations of tsars to be a state secret.\n\nSee also\nBibliography of Russian history (1613\u20131917)\nRulers of Russia family tree\n\nNotes\nPassage 8:\nStein Erik Hagen\nStein Erik Hagen (born 22 July 1956) is a Norwegian businessman.

He became director of markets in RIMI after nine months, and successively became CEO of RIMI and Hakon Gruppen. From 2000 to 2003 Ruzicka was the CEO of Ahold in the Czech Republic and Slovakia. He then left the conglomerate together with Stein Erik Hagen.

Only uncertain and contradictory information is available about her early life. Said to have been born on 15 April 1684 (o.s. 5 April), she was originally named Marta Helena Skowro\u0144ska. Marta was the daughter of Samuel Skowro\u0144ski (later spelled Samuil Skavronsky), a Roman Catholic farmer from the eastern parts of the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth, born to Minsker parents. In 1680 he married Dorothea Hahn at Jakobstadt. Her mother is named in at least one source as Elizabeth Moritz, the daughter of a Baltic German woman and there is debate as to whether Moritz's father was a Swedish officer. It is likely that two stories were conflated, and Swedish sources suggest that the Elizabeth Moritz story is probably incorrect. Some biographies state that Marta's father was a gravedigger and handyman, while others speculate that he was a runaway landless serf.\nMarta's parents died of the plague around 1689, leaving five children. According to one of the popular versions, at the age of three Marta was taken by an aunt and sent to Marienburg (the present-day Al\u016bksne in Latvia, near the border with Estonia and Russia) where she was raised by Johann Ernst Gl\u00fcck, a Lutheran pastor and educator who was the first to translate the Bible into Latvian. In his household she served as a lowly servant, likely either a scullery maid or washerwoman.  No effort was made to teach her to read and write and she remained illiterate throughout her life.\nMarta was considered a very beautiful young girl, and there are accounts that Frau Gl\u00fcck became fearful that she would become involved with her son. At the age of seventeen, she was married off to a Swedish dragoon, Johan Cruse or Johann Rabbe, with whom she remained for eight days in 1702, at which point the Swedish troops were withdrawn from Marienburg. When Russian forces captured the town, Pastor Gl\u00fcck offered to work as a translator, and Field Marshal Boris Sheremetev agreed to his proposal and took him to Moscow.\nThere are unsubstantiated stories that Marta worked briefly in the laundry of the victorious regiment, and also that she was presented in her undergarments to Brigadier General Rudolph Felix Bauer, later the Governor of Estonia, to be his mistress. She may have worked in the household of his superior, Sheremetev. It is not known whether she was his mistress, or household maid.  She travelled back to the Russian court with Sheremetev's army.Afterwards she became part of the household of Prince Alexander Menshikov, who was the best friend of Peter the Great of Russia. Anecdotal sources suggest that she was purchased by him. Whether the two of them were lovers is disputed, as Menshikov was already engaged to Darya Arsenyeva, his future wife. It is clear that Menshikov and Marta formed a lifetime alliance.\nIt is possible that Menshikov, who was quite jealous of Peter's attentions and knew his tastes, wanted to procure a mistress on whom he could rely. In any case, in 1703, while visiting Menshikov at his home, Peter met Marta. In 1704, she was well established in the Tsar's household as his mistress, and gave birth to a son, Peter. In 1703, she converted to Orthodoxy and took the new name Catherine Alexeyevna (Yekaterina Alexeyevna). She and Darya Menshikova accompanied Peter and Menshikov on their military excursions.\n\nMarriage and family life\nThough no record exists, Catherine and Peter are described as having married secretly between 23 October and 1 December 1707 in Saint Petersburg. They had twelve children, two of whom survived into adulthood, Anna (born 1708) and Elizabeth (born 1709).\nPeter had moved the capital to St. Petersburg in 1703. While the city was being built he lived in a three-room log cabin with Catherine, where she did the cooking and caring for the children, and he tended a garden as though they were an ordinary couple. The relationship was the most successful of Peter's life and a great number of letters exist demonstrating the strong affection between Catherine and Peter. As a person she was very energetic, compassionate, charming, and always cheerful. She was able to calm Peter in his frequent rages and was often called in to do so.\nCatherine went with Peter on his Pruth Campaign in 1711. There, she was said to have saved Peter and his Empire, as related by Voltaire in his book Peter the Great. Surrounded by overwhelming numbers of Turkish troops, Catherine suggested before surrendering, that her jewels and those of the other women be used in an effort to bribe the Ottoman grand vizier Baltac\u0131 Mehmet Pasha into allowing a retreat.\nMehmet allowed the retreat, whether motivated by the bribe or considerations of trade and diplomacy. In any case Peter credited Catherine and proceeded to marry her again (this time officially) at Saint Isaac's Cathedral in St. Petersburg on 9 February 1712.  She was Peter's second wife; he had previously married and divorced Eudoxia Lopukhina, who had borne him the Tsarevich Alexis Petrovich. Upon their wedding, Catherine took on the style of her husband and became Tsarina. When Peter elevated the Russian Tsardom to Empire, Catherine became Empress. The Order of Saint Catherine was instituted by her husband on the occasion of their wedding.\n\nIssue\nCatherine and Peter had twelve children, all of whom died in childhood except Anna and Elizabeth:\n\nPeter Petrovich (1704\u20131707), died in infancy\nPaul Petrovich (October 1705\u20131707), died in infancy\nCatherine Petrovna (7 February 1707\u20137 August 1708)\nGrand Duchess Anna Petrovna (27 January 1708\u201315 May 1728)\nGrand Duchess Elizabeth Petrovna (29 December 1709\u20135 January 1762)\nGrand Duchess Mary Natalia Petrovna (20 March 1713\u201317 May 1715)\nGrand Duchess Margaret Petrovna (19 September 1714\u20137 June 1715)\nGrand Duke Peter Petrovich (9 November 1715\u20136 May 1719)\n\nGrand Duke Paul Petrovich (13 January 1717\u201314 January 1717)\nGrand Duchess Natalia Petrovna (31 August 1718\u201315 March 1725)\nGrand Duke Peter Petrovich (7 October 1723\u20137 October 1723)\nGrand Duke Paul Petrovich (1724\u20131724)\n\nSiblings\nUpon Peter's death, Catherine found her four siblings, Krystyna, Anna, Karol, and Fryderyk, gave them the newly created titles of Count and Countess, and brought them to Russia.\n\nKrystyna Skowro\u0144ska, renamed Christina (Russian: \u0425\u0440\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0430) Samuilovna Skavronskaya (1687\u201314 April 1729), had married Simon Heinrich (Russian: \u0421\u0438\u043c\u043e\u043d \u0413\u0435\u0439\u043d\u0440\u0438\u0445) (1672\u20131728) and their descendants became the Counts Gendrikov.\nAnna Skowro\u0144ska, renamed Anna Samuilovna Skavronskaya, had married one Michael-Joachim N and their descendants became the Counts Efimovsky.\nKarol Skowro\u0144ski, renamed Karel Samuilovich Skavronsky, was created a Count of the Russian Empire on 5 January 1727 and made a Chamberlain of the Imperial Court; he had married Maria Ivanovna, a Russian woman, by whom he had descendants who became extinct in the male line with the death of Count Paul Martinovich Skavronskyi (1757-1793), father of Princess Catherine Bagration.\nFryderyk Skowro\u0144ski, renamed Feodor Samuilovich Skavronsky, was created a Count of the Russian Empire on 5 January 1727 and was married twice: to N, a Lithuanian woman, and to Ekaterina Rodionovna Saburova, without having children by either of them.\n\nReign as empress regnant\nCatherine was crowned in 1724. The year before his death, Peter and Catherine had an estrangement over her support of Willem Mons, brother of Peter's former mistress Anna, and brother to one of the current ladies in waiting for Catherine, Matryona. He served as Catherine's secretary. Peter had fought his entire life to clear up corruption in Russia. Catherine had a great deal of influence over who could gain access to her husband. Willem Mons and his sister Matryona had begun selling their influence to those who wanted access to Catherine and, through her, to Peter. Apparently this had been overlooked by Catherine, who was fond of both. Peter found out and had Willem Mons executed and his sister Matryona exiled. He and Catherine did not speak for several months. Rumors flew that she and Mons had had an affair, but there is no evidence for this.\nPeter died (28 January 1725 Old Style) without naming a successor. Catherine represented the interests of the \"new men\", commoners who had been brought to positions of great power by Peter based on competence. A change of government was likely to favor the entrenched aristocrats. For that reason during a meeting of a council to decide on a successor, a coup was arranged by Menshikov and others in which the guards regiments with whom Catherine was very popular proclaimed her the ruler of Russia. Supporting evidence was \"produced\" from Peter's secretary Makarov and the Bishop of Pskov, both \"new men\" with motivation to see Catherine take over. The real power, however, lay with Menshikov, Peter Tolstoy, and other members of the Supreme Privy Council.\nCatherine viewed the deposed empress Eudoxia as a threat, so she secretly moved her to Shlisselburg Fortress near St. Petersburg to be put in a secret prison under strict custody as a state prisoner.\n\nDeath\nCatherine I died two years after Peter I, on 17 May 1727 at age 43, in St. Petersburg, where she was buried at St. Peter and St. Paul Fortress. Tuberculosis, diagnosed as an abscess of the lungs, caused her early demise.\nBefore her death she recognized Peter II, the grandson of Peter I and Eudoxia, as her successor.\n\nAssessment and legacy\nCatherine was the first woman to rule Imperial Russia, opening the legal path for a century almost entirely dominated by women, including her daughter Elizabeth and granddaughter-in-law Catherine the Great, all of whom continued Peter the Great's policies in modernizing Russia.  At the time of Peter's death the Russian Army, composed of 130,000 men and supplemented by another 100,000 Cossacks, was easily the largest in Europe.  However, the expense of the military was proving ruinous to the Russian economy, consuming some 65% of the government's annual revenue.  Since the nation was at peace, Catherine was determined to reduce military expenditure.  For most of her reign, Catherine I was controlled by her advisers.  However, on this single issue, the reduction of military expenses, Catherine was able to have her way.  The resulting tax relief on the peasantry led to the reputation of Catherine I as a just and fair ruler.The Supreme Privy Council concentrated power in the hands of one party, and thus was an executive innovation. In foreign affairs, Russia reluctantly joined the Austro-Spanish league to defend the interests of Catherine's son-in-law, the Duke of Holstein, against Great Britain.\nCatherine gave her name to Catherinehof near St. Petersburg, and built the first bridges in the new capital. She was also the first royal owner of the Tsarskoye Selo estate, where the Catherine Palace still bears her name.\nThe city of Yekaterinburg is named after her, Yekaterina being the Russian form of her name.\nShe also gave her name to the Kadriorg Palace (German: Katharinental, meaning \"Catherine's Valley\"), its adjacent Kadriorg Park and the later Kadriorg neighbourhood of Tallinn, Estonia, which today houses the Presidential Palace of Estonia. The name of the neighbourhood is also used as a metonym for the institution of the President.\nIn general, Catherine's policies were reasonable and cautious.  The story of her humble origins was considered by later generations of tsars to be a state secret.\n\nSee also\nBibliography of Russian history (1613\u20131917)\nRulers of Russia family tree\n\nNotes\nPassage 8:\nStein Erik Hagen\nStein Erik Hagen (born 22 July 1956) is a Norwegian businessman.

Ruzicka earned siv.\u00f8k. and MBA degrees at Oslo Business School. In 1990 he was hired in Hakon Gruppen by Stein Erik Hagen. He became director of markets in RIMI after nine months, and successively became CEO of RIMI and Hakon Gruppen. From 2000 to 2003 Ruzicka was the CEO of Ahold in the Czech Republic and Slovakia. He then left the conglomerate together with Stein Erik Hagen.

In 1893 he won a scholarship for composition to the Royal College of Music.\nIn his early twenties he contributed to The Scottish Students' Song Book, with three of his own song compositions and numerous arrangements.\nBy the end of 1897 he had published dozens of songs, such as Sir Patrick Spens, The Death of Cuthullin, an album of his own compositions, and arrangements of ten songs by Samuel Lover.\nHe then, living in London, turned his attention to staged musical comedy, co-creating, with Adrian Ross, The Tree Dumas Skiteers, a skit, based on Sydney Grundy's The Musketeers that starred Herbert Beerbohm Tree. He co-composed with Howard Talbot the successful Kitty Grey (1900).He continued to write songs and to receive recognition for them. The 1901 and 1902 BBC Promenade Concerts, \"The Proms\", included four of his compositions, namely Come back, sweet Love, The Mermaid, My Peggy and Private Donald.\nHis setting of My Ships, a poem by Ella Wheeler Wilcox, was performed by Clara Butt and republished several times.

He attended Prince Charles on the Spanish adventure, served as admiral in the unsuccessful Cadiz Expedition in 1625, and commanded the disastrous attempt upon Rochelle in 1628, becoming the same year a member of the Council of war, and in 1633 a Member of the Council of Wales and the Marches.\nIn 1631, Lord Denbigh ventured to the East as erstwhile ambassador to the court of Safi of Persia. He visited the East India Company's fledgling Indian possessions where, in 1632, Lord Denbigh met with the Mogul emperor. He returned to England in late 1633.On 6 July 1641 a barge carrying Feilding, his daughter Elizabeth, Lady Kinalmeaky, Lady Cornwallis, and Anne Kirke capsized while shooting the rapids at London Bridge. Kirke was drowned but the other passengers were rescued.On the outbreak of the English Civil War he served under Prince Rupert of the Rhine and was present at the Battle of Edgehill. On 3 April 1643 during Rupert's attack on Birmingham he was wounded and died from the effects on the 8th, being buried at Monks Kirby in Warwickshire. His courage, unselfishness and devotion to duty are much praised by Edward Hyde, Earl of Clarendon.\n\nFamily\nSir William and his wife, Susan Villiers, had six children:\n\nBasil Feilding, 2nd Earl of Denbigh (c. 1608\u20131675)\nGeorge Feilding, 1st Earl of Desmond (c. 1614\u20131665)\nLady Mary Feilding (1613\u20131638), married James Hamilton, 1st Duke of Hamilton.\nLady Anne Feilding (died 1636), married Baptist Noel, 3rd Viscount Campden\nElizabeth Feilding, Countess of Guildford (died 1667), married Lewis Boyle, 1st Viscount Boyle.\nLady Henrietta Marie Feilding (died young)His daughter, Lady Mary Feilding (1613\u20131638), also known as Margaret, was married to James Hamilton, 1st Duke of Hamilton, one of the heirs to the throne of Scotland after the descendants of James VI (James I of England). Her portrait was painted by Anthony van Dyck and Henry Pierce Bone. His eldest son, Basil, inherited the title of Earl of Denbigh. His second son, George Feilding, was awarded the right to the title of Earl of Desmond at the same time as his father was made Earl of Denbigh in 1622. George Feilding was around eight years old at the time. Earl of Desmond was a lesser title than Earl of Denbigh, being a title in the Irish, rather than English, peerage.\n\nAncestry\nNotes\nPassage 3:\nGeorge Feilding, 1st Earl of Desmond\nGeorge Feilding, 1st Earl of Desmond (c. 1614 \u2013 31 January 1665) was an English aristocrat, awarded the title of Earl of Desmond in the Peerage of Ireland by Charles I  of England under the terms of a letter patent issued by James I of England.\nGeorge Feilding was the second son of William Feilding, 1st Earl of Denbigh, and his wife, the former Susan Villiers. Susan was the sister of George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham, confidant and lover of James I, and her family were showered with titles and preferment as a result of George Villiers' immense influence.In 1622, when George Feilding was around 8 years old, James I created him Baron Fielding, of Lecaghe in the County of Tipperary, and Viscount Callan, of Callan in the County of Kilkenny. At the same time, George was given the right to the title Earl of Desmond as and when the previous holder of that title, Richard Preston, died without a male heir. Preston had also been a favourite and probably a lover of James I; he had a daughter who, the plan was, George Feilding would marry, but this did not happen. In 1628 Preston died and George inherited the title.All three titles were in the Peerage of Ireland. Earl of Desmond is an ancient Irish title, the 1622 creation was its 4th, and current, creation.\nGeorge married Bridget Stanhope, who was the daughter of Sir Michael Stanhope and  Elizabeth Read and a sister-in-law of George Berkeley, 8th Baron Berkeley.\nThe couple had several children:\n\nLady Frances Feilding (died 1680), who married Sir Edward Gage, 1st Baronet, as his third wife\nLady Mary Feilding (died 1691), who married Sir Charles Gawdy, 1st Baronet\nLady Bridget Feilding (died 1669), who married Arthur Parsons\nWilliam Feilding, 2nd Earl of Desmond, later 3rd Earl of Denbigh\nHon.

He was the son of Maurice FitzGerald, 1st Earl of Desmond, by his third wife Aveline (Eleanor), daughter of Nicholas FitzMaurice, 3rd Lord of Kerry.  He was half-brother to Maurice FitzGerald, 2nd Earl of Desmond.Maurice Fitzgerald, 2nd Earl of Desmond, would have been followed by Gerald's older brother, Nicholas, but Nicholas was described as \"an idiot\", and so was passed over for the earldom. Because of this, some older histories list Gerald as the 4th Earl.\n\nLife\nIn 1356 he was brought to England as a hostage for his father's good behaviour, but as his father died that same year, he was soon released. Three years later, he succeeded his brother Maurice, who had died without male heirs, and became the 3rd Earl of Desmond.King Edward III confirmed Gerald in his large estates in Munster, provided that he marry Eleanor Butler, daughter of the Justiciar, James Butler, 2nd Earl of Ormond. Gerald did so, but did not make peace with Ormond, nor adopt English ways and customs as expected.\n\nCareer and poetry\nAccording to Alfred Webb:\n\"[He was] surnamed 'Gerald the Poet', [and] succeeded to the estates and honours of the family. He married, by the King's command, Eleanor, daughter of James, 2nd Earl of Ormond, who brought with her as her portion the barony of Inchiquin in Imokelly. Gerald was Lord Justice of Ireland, 1367. In 1398 he disappeared, and is fabled to live beneath the waters of Lough Gur, near Kilmallock, on whose banks he appears once every seven years. O'Donovan quotes the following concerning his character: 'A nobleman of wonderful bountie, mirth, cheerfulness in conversation, charitable in his deeds, easy of access, a witty and ingenious composer of Irish poetry, and a learned and profound chronicler; and, in fine, one of the English nobility that had Irish learning and professors thereof in greatest reverence of all the English in Ireland, died penitently after receipt of the sacraments of the holy church in proper form.' Fragments of Anglo-Norman verse attributed to him, known as Proverbs of the Earl of Desmond, survive.\"Duanaire Ghear\u00f3id Iarla (\u2018'The Poem-Book of Earl Gerald\u2019') is preserved in a fifteenth-century manuscript, the Book of Fermoy. In addition, nine of his poems are preserved in the Book of the Dean of Lismore. Duanaire Ghear\u00f3id Iarla was published by Gear\u00f3id Mac Niocaill in Studia Hibernica 3 (1963): 7-59.In 1367 Desmond was made Lord Chief Justice of Ireland, but was soon replaced by Sir William de Windsor. In 1370 Brian O'Brien of Thomond expelled his cousin Turlough. Desmond attempted to reinstate him. Brian marched on Limerick, and defeated Desmond, burning the city and Desmond's lands and imprisoning him.While in prison, Gerald wrote poetry in Irish, most famously the poem Mairg adeir olc ris na mn\u00e1ibh (Speak not ill of womankind). Also an accomplished poet in Norman French, Gerald was instrumental in the move by the Desmond Geraldines towards greater use of the Irish language.\n\nIn legend\nIn legend, Gerald's conception was the result of his father's romantic relationship with, or rape of, the goddess \u00c1ine, a legend that draws upon a pre-existing Celtic legend about the King of Munster Ailill Aulom raping this deity, updating it with themes drawn from the Francophone courtly love poetry of Continental Europe, in particular the motif of the man who falls in love with a swan maiden. The Geraldine claim to an association with \u00c1ine is typical of the family's Gaelicisation.\nAfter his disappearance in 1398, another legend grew up that Gerald sleeps in a cave beside (or under) Lough Gur, and will someday awaken and ride forth on a silver-shod steed to rule again in Desmond, \u2013 one of the many worldwide versions of the King asleep in mountain mythologisation of heroes.\n\nMarriage and issue\nIn 1359 Gerald married Eleanor (or Ellen) Butler, daughter of James Butler, 2nd Earl of Ormond. She died in 1404. They had four sons:\n\nJohn FitzGerald, 4th Earl of Desmond\nMaurice FitzGerald\nJames FitzGerald, 6th Earl of Desmond, 'the Usurper'\nRobert FitzGerald de Adairand two daughters:\n\nJoan, who married Maurice FitzJohn, Lord of Kerry\nCatherine, who married John FitzThomas\n\nSee also\nList of people who disappeared\n\nAncestry\nPassage 5:\nMaurice FitzGerald, 9th Earl of Desmond\nMaurice FitzGerald, 9th Earl of Desmond (died 1520) was the brother of James FitzGerald, 8th Earl of Desmond.\n\nLife\nUpon the murder of James FitzThomas FitzGerald, the 8th Earl of Desmond, in 1487, his brother Maurice became the 9th Earl of Desmond. The murderer, John Murtagh was apprehended and put to death.\nIn 1489 a plague ravaged the country, followed by a famine in 1497, and many died.According to Alfred Webb: \"Being lame, and usually carried in a horse-litter, he was styled 'Vehiculus,' and by some, on account of his bravery, 'Bellicosus.'\"In 1495, Maurice FitzThomas FitzGerald supported the pretender, Perkin Warbeck, in the Siege of Waterford and other expeditions. Nevertheless, making a humble submission, King Henry VII not only forgave, but took him into favour, 26 August 1497, and granted him all the 'customs, pockets, poundage, and prize-wines of Limerick, Cork, Kingsale, Baltimore, and Youghall, with other privileges and advantages.'\nAbout the year 1500, Maurice FitzGerald rebuilt Desmond Castle, a three-story tower house in the town of Kinsale, to serve as a Customs House for wine and gunpowder.\n\"The condition of the inhabitants within the Pale at this period is thus described by a contemporary writer: 'What with the extortion of coyne and lyverye dayly, and wyth the wrongful exaction of osteing money, and of carryage and cartage dayly, and what with the Kinge's great subsydye yerely, and with the said trybute, and blak-rent to the Kinge's Iryshe enymyes, and other infynyt extortions, and dayly exactions, all the Englyshe folke of the countys of Dublyn, Kyldare, Meathe, and Uryell ben more oppressyd with than any other folke of this land, Englyshe or Iryshe, and of worsse condition be they athysside than in the marcheis.' O'Daly thus writes of Earl Maurice: 'This man was subsequently far famed for his martial exploits. He augmented his power and possessions \u2014 for all his sympathies were English \u2014 and a furious scourge was he to the Irish, who never ceased to rebel against the crown of England. The bitterest enemy of the Geraldines he made his prisoner, to wit, MacCarthy Mor, Lord of Muskerry; and now having passed thirty years opulent, powerful, and dreaded, he died [1520] to the sorrow of his friends and the exultation of his enemies.' He was buried at Tralee. His first wife was daughter of Lord Fermoy; his second, daughter of the White Knight.\"\n\nMarriage and issue\n\t\nMaurice first married Ellen, daughter of Maurice Roche, 2nd Lord of Fermoy (distantly related to the Barons Fermoy), and his wife Lady Joan FitzGerald, daughter of James FitzGerald, 8th Earl of Desmond, and had issue:\n\nThomas FitzMaurice, who predeceased his father, leaving behind one daughter\nJames FitzGerald, 10th Earl of Desmond\nJoan, who married Cormac \u00d3g MacCarthy\nEllis, who married Connor O'Brien, King of ThomondMaurice's second wife was Honora, daughter of the White Knight.\nPassage 6:\nJohn FitzGerald, de facto 12th Earl of Desmond\nJohn FitzGerald, de facto 12th Earl of Desmond (died December 1536) was the brother of Thomas FitzGerald, 11th Earl of Desmond. Upon his brother's death in 1534, John disputed the title to the earldom of his brother's grandson, James FitzGerald, de jure 12th Earl of Desmond.According to the Annals of the Four Masters, John FitzThomas FitzGerald was believed to have instigated the murder of his older brother, James FitzGerald, 8th Earl of Desmond in 1487, and had been expelled by his brother Maurice FitzGerald, 9th Earl of Desmond.John died in 1536. His grandnephew, the de jure earl, died in 1540, and was succeeded by John's son, James FitzGerald, 13th Earl of Desmond.\nAlfred Webb tells us of this earl that he, \"being supported by a large faction, was de facto [12th] Earl. This Sir John died about Christmas 1536.\"\nPassage 7:\nJames FitzGerald, 6th Earl of Desmond\nJames FitzGerald, 6th Earl of Desmond (d. 1462), called 'the Usurper', was a younger son of Gerald FitzGerald, 3rd Earl of Desmond, and Lady Eleanor, daughter of James Butler, 2nd Earl of Ormond.\n\nLife\nThe younger brother of John FitzGerald, 4th Earl of Desmond, James was uncle to the 4th Earl's only son Thomas FitzGerald, 5th Earl of Desmond, whom he was able to deprive of his earldom and dispossess in 1418 for marrying far below his station. The marriage between a man of Norman ancestry and a woman of Gaelic blood was in violation of the Statutes of Kilkenny. James FitzGerald took a leading role in forcing his nephew into exile in France where he died at Rouen two years later.\nAlthough not acknowledged until 1422, he was in 1420 made Seneschal of Imokilly, Inchiquin, and the town of Youghal, by James Butler, 4th Earl of Ormond. Also in 1420, he founded the Franciscan friary at Askeaton Abbey.In 1423 he was made Constable of Limerick for life. In 1445 he was excused attendance at Parliament. Along with his son-in-law Thomas FitzGerald, 7th Earl of Kildare, James was a prominent Irish supporter of the House of York.\nHe was also godfather to George Plantagenet, 1st Duke of Clarence.\nDying in 1462 or 1463, Desmond was buried at the Franciscan friary in Youghal.\n\nMarriage and issue\nJames married Mary, daughter of William de Burgh, and they had issue two sons:\n\nThomas FitzGerald, 7th Earl of Desmond\nSir Gerald Mor FitzGerald, ancestor of the FitzGerald Lords of Decies of County Waterfordand two daughters:\n\nHonor, married Thomas Fitzmaurice., Lord of Kerry\nJoan/Jane, married Thomas FitzGerald, 7th Earl of Kildare\n\nAncestry\nNotes\nPassage 8:\nJohn FitzGerald, 4th Earl of Desmond\nJohn FitzGerald, 4th Earl of Desmond (died 1399) was the son of Gerald FitzGerald, 3rd Earl of Desmond.  He married and had one son, Thomas, who succeeded him as Earl of Desmond.According to Burke, John FitzGerald married Joan Roche, the daughter of Lord Fermoy. On 4 March 1399, FitzGerald drowned at Ardfinnan on the River Suir, returning from an incursion into the territory of the Earl of Ormond..He was buried at Youghal, and succeeded by his son Thomas FitzJohn FitzGerald, 5th Earl of Desmond.\nPassage 9:\nWilliam Feilding, 3rd Earl of Denbigh\nWilliam Feilding, 3rd Earl of Denbigh, 2nd Earl of Desmond (29 December 1640 \u2013 23 August 1685) was an aristocrat in the Peerage of England. He was the son of George Feilding, 1st Earl of Desmond, and his wife, the former Bridget Stanhope, daughter of Sir Michael Stanhope.Feilding inherited the title of Earl of Denbigh from his paternal uncle Basil Feilding, 2nd Earl of Denbigh, who died without heirs in 1675.He married, firstly, Mary King (died 1669), daughter of Sir Robert King and Frances Folliott, daughter of Henry Folliott, 1st Baron Folliott and Anne Strode, and widow of Sir William Meredyth. Secondly, he married Lady Mary Carey, daughter of Henry Carey, 2nd Earl of Monmouth. He died on 23 August 1685 at age 44.\nBy his first wife, Mary King, Feilding had the following children:\n\nLady Mary Feilding (c. 1668 \u2013 c. December 1697), who married Evelyn Pierrepont, 1st Duke of Kingston-upon-Hull, and had children.\nBasil Feilding, 4th Earl of Denbigh (1668 \u2013 18 March 1717), who married Hester Firebrace, and had childrenThere were no children from the earl's second marriage.\nPassage 10:\nJames FitzGerald, 1st Earl of Desmond\nJames FitzGerald (c. 1570 \u2013 November 1601), an Irish nobleman, was the successor of Gerald FitzGerald, 14th Earl of Desmond. He assumed the title of Earl of Desmond, which had been suppressed in 1582 after the Desmond Rebellions. He spent much of his life in captivity, and was temporarily, but unsuccessfully, restored to the earldom in 1600\u201301 by the English in an attempt to pacify Munster during the Nine Years War. He thus became the 1st Earl of Desmond, but soon returned to England, where he died in obscurity.\n\nEarly life\nJames FitzGerald, the son of the 14th Earl and Eleanor Butler, was born during the earlier of the Desmond Rebellions; Queen Elizabeth of England was his godmother. He was resident in Ireland in 1579, when his father joined the later rebellion against the crown, and at that time his mother chose to deliver him to Sir William Drury, lord deputy of Ireland, who placed him in custody in Dublin Castle. In August 1582, his mother complained bitterly to Lord Burghley that her son's education was being neglected and sought better care for him. After the death of his fugitive father, FitzGerald's gaolers made a petition to the English government for his removal to the Tower of London. The petition was granted in 1584, and before the end of the year, he was removed to the Tower, where he remained for the next 16 years.\n\nCaptivity\nFitzGerald was the heir to the earldom of Desmond, but in 1585 his late father's estate was attainted by the Irish parliament and all its property confiscated by the crown. Most of the hereditary lands in the province of Munster then underwent a radical plantation by English settlers (see Plantation of Munster), but such was the loyalty attached to the FitzGerald name there that the government had good cause to fear a future rebellion. These events occurred during the Anglo-Spanish War (1585\u20131604), and English fear was increased with the prospect of an intervention by the Spanish, who had a historical affinity with the west coast of Ireland.\nIt was in this context that the young heir found himself nurtured in London, where he was to lead a miserable existence. He appears to have been sickly, as shown by the accounts kept between 1588 and 1598 of payments for medicines, ointments, pills and syrups administered to him. In 1593, he wrote in pathetic terms to the queen's secretary, Sir Robert Cecil, but the government really only had one use for him.\n\nIrish campaign\nIn 1600, during the Nine Years War (Ireland) and following hostile intrusions into Munster at the direction of Hugh O'Neill, 3rd Earl of Tyrone, it was suggested by Sir George Carew that FitzGerald be paraded through the province as the true Earl of Desmond, to counter the popularity of the pretender to the earldom, James FitzThomas FitzGerald, (known as the S\u00fag\u00e1n \u2013 i.e. Hayrope \u2013 Earl). The queen hesitated at this suggestion, but was convinced by Cecil that the risk was worth taking.\nA patent for the title of Earl of Desmond (the second creation) passed the great seal, without restoration of the confiscated lands and restricting any inheritance of the title; an allowance of \u00a3500 pa. was granted. FitzGerald was to remain in the custody of Captain Price and Miler Magrath, archbishop of Cashel; Price was charged with keeping him faithful to the queen and the Protestant religion, and was to maintain a frugal household. Carew was instructed by Cecil to keep FitzGerald under close observation, ready to arrest him if he showed sympathy with the rebels while allowing the appearance of liberty.\nFitzGerald's party set out from Bristol in October 1600, bound for Cork, but the prisoner suffered such a severe bout of sea-sickness that he had to be landed at Youghal in south Munster. He was received enthusiastically by the Geraldine supporters \u2013 though the mayor of Cork was not courteous \u2013 and was quickly transferred to Mallow, and then to Kilmallock in the heart of Desmond country, where he was given lodgings by the English commander Sir George Thornton. On his arrival he praised the queen's clemency and was well-liked; the next day \u2013 a Sunday \u2013 he ostentatiously made his way to the Protestant church, while his followers awaited him in the Catholic chapel, a disappointment for which he was instantly derided by the people. In November 1600 the fortress of Castlemaine was surrendered to FitzGerald by a servant of the S\u00fag\u00e1n Earl, but owing to his failure to command the allegiance of the people the government soon discarded the Desmond heir.\n\nDeath\nFitzGerald resented the meanness of his allowance and was forbidden by Cecil to marry the widow Norreys, since a better match in England was hoped for. In March 1601 he was brought to London with a letter from Carew recommending him for a grant of land and a settled income. In August he complained of being penniless and despised, and appealed to Cecil for some of the lands that had been held by the S\u00fag\u00e1n Earl. He died in London in early November 1601, but it was only in January 1602 that the death was announced. His guardians were then released from their charge, one of whom, William Power, wrote for pecuniary assistance for FitzGerald's four sisters.\n\nAncestry\nSources\nRichard Bagwell, Ireland under the Tudors 3 vols.

(Some sources list her as Margaret.)The 2nd Earl married Beatrice de Stafford, daughter of Ralph de Stafford, 1st Earl of Stafford and Margaret Audley, but died at Castle Maine without any male issue, and was therefore succeeded in the Earldom of Desmond by his half-brother Gerald FitzGerald, 3rd Earl of Desmond. FitzGerald's widow married Thomas de Ros, 4th Baron de Ros around a year after FitzGerald's death. He was buried in Tralee Abbey.\nPassage 2:\nWilliam Feilding, 1st Earl of Denbigh\nAdmiral William Feilding, 1st Earl of Denbigh (c. 1587 \u2013 8 April 1643, Cannock) was an English naval officer and courtier.\n\nBiography\nWilliam Feilding was the son of Basil Fielding of Newnham Paddox in Warwickshire (High Sheriff of Warwickshire in 1612) and of Elizabeth Aston, daughter of Sir Walter Aston (1530\u20131599).Feilding matriculated at Emmanuel College, Cambridge in 1603. In 1606 Feilding married Susan, daughter of Sir George Villiers and sister of George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham, who was ennobled as the favourite of King James I. With the rise of Villiers, both Feilding and his wife received various offices and dignities.Knighted on 4 March 1607, William Feilding was created Baron and Viscount Feilding in 1620. Two years later he was appointed Master of the Great Wardrobe and Custos Rotulorum of Warwickshire and Earl of Denbigh on 14 September 1622. He attended Prince Charles on the Spanish adventure, served as admiral in the unsuccessful Cadiz Expedition in 1625, and commanded the disastrous attempt upon Rochelle in 1628, becoming the same year a member of the Council of war, and in 1633 a Member of the Council of Wales and the Marches.\nIn 1631, Lord Denbigh ventured to the East as erstwhile ambassador to the court of Safi of Persia. He visited the East India Company's fledgling Indian possessions where, in 1632, Lord Denbigh met with the Mogul emperor. He returned to England in late 1633.On 6 July 1641 a barge carrying Feilding, his daughter Elizabeth, Lady Kinalmeaky, Lady Cornwallis, and Anne Kirke capsized while shooting the rapids at London Bridge. Kirke was drowned but the other passengers were rescued.On the outbreak of the English Civil War he served under Prince Rupert of the Rhine and was present at the Battle of Edgehill. On 3 April 1643 during Rupert's attack on Birmingham he was wounded and died from the effects on the 8th, being buried at Monks Kirby in Warwickshire. His courage, unselfishness and devotion to duty are much praised by Edward Hyde, Earl of Clarendon.\n\nFamily\nSir William and his wife, Susan Villiers, had six children:\n\nBasil Feilding, 2nd Earl of Denbigh (c. 1608\u20131675)\nGeorge Feilding, 1st Earl of Desmond (c. 1614\u20131665)\nLady Mary Feilding (1613\u20131638), married James Hamilton, 1st Duke of Hamilton.\nLady Anne Feilding (died 1636), married Baptist Noel, 3rd Viscount Campden\nElizabeth Feilding, Countess of Guildford (died 1667), married Lewis Boyle, 1st Viscount Boyle.\nLady Henrietta Marie Feilding (died young)His daughter, Lady Mary Feilding (1613\u20131638), also known as Margaret, was married to James Hamilton, 1st Duke of Hamilton, one of the heirs to the throne of Scotland after the descendants of James VI (James I of England). Her portrait was painted by Anthony van Dyck and Henry Pierce Bone. His eldest son, Basil, inherited the title of Earl of Denbigh. His second son, George Feilding, was awarded the right to the title of Earl of Desmond at the same time as his father was made Earl of Denbigh in 1622. George Feilding was around eight years old at the time. Earl of Desmond was a lesser title than Earl of Denbigh, being a title in the Irish, rather than English, peerage.\n\nAncestry\nNotes\nPassage 3:\nGeorge Feilding, 1st Earl of Desmond\nGeorge Feilding, 1st Earl of Desmond (c. 1614 \u2013 31 January 1665) was an English aristocrat, awarded the title of Earl of Desmond in the Peerage of Ireland by Charles I  of England under the terms of a letter patent issued by James I of England.\nGeorge Feilding was the second son of William Feilding, 1st Earl of Denbigh, and his wife, the former Susan Villiers. Susan was the sister of George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham, confidant and lover of James I, and her family were showered with titles and preferment as a result of George Villiers' immense influence.In 1622, when George Feilding was around 8 years old, James I created him Baron Fielding, of Lecaghe in the County of Tipperary, and Viscount Callan, of Callan in the County of Kilkenny. At the same time, George was given the right to the title Earl of Desmond as and when the previous holder of that title, Richard Preston, died without a male heir. Preston had also been a favourite and probably a lover of James I; he had a daughter who, the plan was, George Feilding would marry, but this did not happen. In 1628 Preston died and George inherited the title.All three titles were in the Peerage of Ireland.

He was the son of Maurice FitzGerald, 1st Earl of Desmond, by his third wife Aveline (Eleanor), daughter of Nicholas FitzMaurice, 3rd Lord of Kerry.  He was half-brother to Maurice FitzGerald, 2nd Earl of Desmond.Maurice Fitzgerald, 2nd Earl of Desmond, would have been followed by Gerald's older brother, Nicholas, but Nicholas was described as \"an idiot\", and so was passed over for the earldom. Because of this, some older histories list Gerald as the 4th Earl.\n\nLife\nIn 1356 he was brought to England as a hostage for his father's good behaviour, but as his father died that same year, he was soon released. Three years later, he succeeded his brother Maurice, who had died without male heirs, and became the 3rd Earl of Desmond.King Edward III confirmed Gerald in his large estates in Munster, provided that he marry Eleanor Butler, daughter of the Justiciar, James Butler, 2nd Earl of Ormond. Gerald did so, but did not make peace with Ormond, nor adopt English ways and customs as expected.\n\nCareer and poetry\nAccording to Alfred Webb:\n\"[He was] surnamed 'Gerald the Poet', [and] succeeded to the estates and honours of the family. He married, by the King's command, Eleanor, daughter of James, 2nd Earl of Ormond, who brought with her as her portion the barony of Inchiquin in Imokelly. Gerald was Lord Justice of Ireland, 1367. In 1398 he disappeared, and is fabled to live beneath the waters of Lough Gur, near Kilmallock, on whose banks he appears once every seven years. O'Donovan quotes the following concerning his character: 'A nobleman of wonderful bountie, mirth, cheerfulness in conversation, charitable in his deeds, easy of access, a witty and ingenious composer of Irish poetry, and a learned and profound chronicler; and, in fine, one of the English nobility that had Irish learning and professors thereof in greatest reverence of all the English in Ireland, died penitently after receipt of the sacraments of the holy church in proper form.' Fragments of Anglo-Norman verse attributed to him, known as Proverbs of the Earl of Desmond, survive.\"Duanaire Ghear\u00f3id Iarla (\u2018'The Poem-Book of Earl Gerald\u2019') is preserved in a fifteenth-century manuscript, the Book of Fermoy. In addition, nine of his poems are preserved in the Book of the Dean of Lismore. Duanaire Ghear\u00f3id Iarla was published by Gear\u00f3id Mac Niocaill in Studia Hibernica 3 (1963): 7-59.In 1367 Desmond was made Lord Chief Justice of Ireland, but was soon replaced by Sir William de Windsor. In 1370 Brian O'Brien of Thomond expelled his cousin Turlough. Desmond attempted to reinstate him. Brian marched on Limerick, and defeated Desmond, burning the city and Desmond's lands and imprisoning him.While in prison, Gerald wrote poetry in Irish, most famously the poem Mairg adeir olc ris na mn\u00e1ibh (Speak not ill of womankind). Also an accomplished poet in Norman French, Gerald was instrumental in the move by the Desmond Geraldines towards greater use of the Irish language.\n\nIn legend\nIn legend, Gerald's conception was the result of his father's romantic relationship with, or rape of, the goddess \u00c1ine, a legend that draws upon a pre-existing Celtic legend about the King of Munster Ailill Aulom raping this deity, updating it with themes drawn from the Francophone courtly love poetry of Continental Europe, in particular the motif of the man who falls in love with a swan maiden. The Geraldine claim to an association with \u00c1ine is typical of the family's Gaelicisation.\nAfter his disappearance in 1398, another legend grew up that Gerald sleeps in a cave beside (or under) Lough Gur, and will someday awaken and ride forth on a silver-shod steed to rule again in Desmond, \u2013 one of the many worldwide versions of the King asleep in mountain mythologisation of heroes.\n\nMarriage and issue\nIn 1359 Gerald married Eleanor (or Ellen) Butler, daughter of James Butler, 2nd Earl of Ormond. She died in 1404. They had four sons:\n\nJohn FitzGerald, 4th Earl of Desmond\nMaurice FitzGerald\nJames FitzGerald, 6th Earl of Desmond, 'the Usurper'\nRobert FitzGerald de Adairand two daughters:\n\nJoan, who married Maurice FitzJohn, Lord of Kerry\nCatherine, who married John FitzThomas\n\nSee also\nList of people who disappeared\n\nAncestry\nPassage 5:\nMaurice FitzGerald, 9th Earl of Desmond\nMaurice FitzGerald, 9th Earl of Desmond (died 1520) was the brother of James FitzGerald, 8th Earl of Desmond.\n\nLife\nUpon the murder of James FitzThomas FitzGerald, the 8th Earl of Desmond, in 1487, his brother Maurice became the 9th Earl of Desmond. The murderer, John Murtagh was apprehended and put to death.\nIn 1489 a plague ravaged the country, followed by a famine in 1497, and many died.According to Alfred Webb: \"Being lame, and usually carried in a horse-litter, he was styled 'Vehiculus,' and by some, on account of his bravery, 'Bellicosus.'\"In 1495, Maurice FitzThomas FitzGerald supported the pretender, Perkin Warbeck, in the Siege of Waterford and other expeditions. Nevertheless, making a humble submission, King Henry VII not only forgave, but took him into favour, 26 August 1497, and granted him all the 'customs, pockets, poundage, and prize-wines of Limerick, Cork, Kingsale, Baltimore, and Youghall, with other privileges and advantages.'\nAbout the year 1500, Maurice FitzGerald rebuilt Desmond Castle, a three-story tower house in the town of Kinsale, to serve as a Customs House for wine and gunpowder.\n\"The condition of the inhabitants within the Pale at this period is thus described by a contemporary writer: 'What with the extortion of coyne and lyverye dayly, and wyth the wrongful exaction of osteing money, and of carryage and cartage dayly, and what with the Kinge's great subsydye yerely, and with the said trybute, and blak-rent to the Kinge's Iryshe enymyes, and other infynyt extortions, and dayly exactions, all the Englyshe folke of the countys of Dublyn, Kyldare, Meathe, and Uryell ben more oppressyd with than any other folke of this land, Englyshe or Iryshe, and of worsse condition be they athysside than in the marcheis.' O'Daly thus writes of Earl Maurice: 'This man was subsequently far famed for his martial exploits. He augmented his power and possessions \u2014 for all his sympathies were English \u2014 and a furious scourge was he to the Irish, who never ceased to rebel against the crown of England. The bitterest enemy of the Geraldines he made his prisoner, to wit, MacCarthy Mor, Lord of Muskerry; and now having passed thirty years opulent, powerful, and dreaded, he died [1520] to the sorrow of his friends and the exultation of his enemies.' He was buried at Tralee. His first wife was daughter of Lord Fermoy; his second, daughter of the White Knight.\"\n\nMarriage and issue\n\t\nMaurice first married Ellen, daughter of Maurice Roche, 2nd Lord of Fermoy (distantly related to the Barons Fermoy), and his wife Lady Joan FitzGerald, daughter of James FitzGerald, 8th Earl of Desmond, and had issue:\n\nThomas FitzMaurice, who predeceased his father, leaving behind one daughter\nJames FitzGerald, 10th Earl of Desmond\nJoan, who married Cormac \u00d3g MacCarthy\nEllis, who married Connor O'Brien, King of ThomondMaurice's second wife was Honora, daughter of the White Knight.\nPassage 6:\nJohn FitzGerald, de facto 12th Earl of Desmond\nJohn FitzGerald, de facto 12th Earl of Desmond (died December 1536) was the brother of Thomas FitzGerald, 11th Earl of Desmond. Upon his brother's death in 1534, John disputed the title to the earldom of his brother's grandson, James FitzGerald, de jure 12th Earl of Desmond.According to the Annals of the Four Masters, John FitzThomas FitzGerald was believed to have instigated the murder of his older brother, James FitzGerald, 8th Earl of Desmond in 1487, and had been expelled by his brother Maurice FitzGerald, 9th Earl of Desmond.John died in 1536. His grandnephew, the de jure earl, died in 1540, and was succeeded by John's son, James FitzGerald, 13th Earl of Desmond.\nAlfred Webb tells us of this earl that he, \"being supported by a large faction, was de facto [12th] Earl. This Sir John died about Christmas 1536.\"\nPassage 7:\nJames FitzGerald, 6th Earl of Desmond\nJames FitzGerald, 6th Earl of Desmond (d. 1462), called 'the Usurper', was a younger son of Gerald FitzGerald, 3rd Earl of Desmond, and Lady Eleanor, daughter of James Butler, 2nd Earl of Ormond.\n\nLife\nThe younger brother of John FitzGerald, 4th Earl of Desmond, James was uncle to the 4th Earl's only son Thomas FitzGerald, 5th Earl of Desmond, whom he was able to deprive of his earldom and dispossess in 1418 for marrying far below his station. The marriage between a man of Norman ancestry and a woman of Gaelic blood was in violation of the Statutes of Kilkenny. James FitzGerald took a leading role in forcing his nephew into exile in France where he died at Rouen two years later.\nAlthough not acknowledged until 1422, he was in 1420 made Seneschal of Imokilly, Inchiquin, and the town of Youghal, by James Butler, 4th Earl of Ormond. Also in 1420, he founded the Franciscan friary at Askeaton Abbey.In 1423 he was made Constable of Limerick for life. In 1445 he was excused attendance at Parliament. Along with his son-in-law Thomas FitzGerald, 7th Earl of Kildare, James was a prominent Irish supporter of the House of York.\nHe was also godfather to George Plantagenet, 1st Duke of Clarence.\nDying in 1462 or 1463, Desmond was buried at the Franciscan friary in Youghal.\n\nMarriage and issue\nJames married Mary, daughter of William de Burgh, and they had issue two sons:\n\nThomas FitzGerald, 7th Earl of Desmond\nSir Gerald Mor FitzGerald, ancestor of the FitzGerald Lords of Decies of County Waterfordand two daughters:\n\nHonor, married Thomas Fitzmaurice., Lord of Kerry\nJoan/Jane, married Thomas FitzGerald, 7th Earl of Kildare\n\nAncestry\nNotes\nPassage 8:\nJohn FitzGerald, 4th Earl of Desmond\nJohn FitzGerald, 4th Earl of Desmond (died 1399) was the son of Gerald FitzGerald, 3rd Earl of Desmond.  He married and had one son, Thomas, who succeeded him as Earl of Desmond.According to Burke, John FitzGerald married Joan Roche, the daughter of Lord Fermoy. On 4 March 1399, FitzGerald drowned at Ardfinnan on the River Suir, returning from an incursion into the territory of the Earl of Ormond..He was buried at Youghal, and succeeded by his son Thomas FitzJohn FitzGerald, 5th Earl of Desmond.\nPassage 9:\nWilliam Feilding, 3rd Earl of Denbigh\nWilliam Feilding, 3rd Earl of Denbigh, 2nd Earl of Desmond (29 December 1640 \u2013 23 August 1685) was an aristocrat in the Peerage of England. He was the son of George Feilding, 1st Earl of Desmond, and his wife, the former Bridget Stanhope, daughter of Sir Michael Stanhope.Feilding inherited the title of Earl of Denbigh from his paternal uncle Basil Feilding, 2nd Earl of Denbigh, who died without heirs in 1675.He married, firstly, Mary King (died 1669), daughter of Sir Robert King and Frances Folliott, daughter of Henry Folliott, 1st Baron Folliott and Anne Strode, and widow of Sir William Meredyth. Secondly, he married Lady Mary Carey, daughter of Henry Carey, 2nd Earl of Monmouth. He died on 23 August 1685 at age 44.\nBy his first wife, Mary King, Feilding had the following children:\n\nLady Mary Feilding (c. 1668 \u2013 c. December 1697), who married Evelyn Pierrepont, 1st Duke of Kingston-upon-Hull, and had children.\nBasil Feilding, 4th Earl of Denbigh (1668 \u2013 18 March 1717), who married Hester Firebrace, and had childrenThere were no children from the earl's second marriage.\nPassage 10:\nJames FitzGerald, 1st Earl of Desmond\nJames FitzGerald (c. 1570 \u2013 November 1601), an Irish nobleman, was the successor of Gerald FitzGerald, 14th Earl of Desmond. He assumed the title of Earl of Desmond, which had been suppressed in 1582 after the Desmond Rebellions. He spent much of his life in captivity, and was temporarily, but unsuccessfully, restored to the earldom in 1600\u201301 by the English in an attempt to pacify Munster during the Nine Years War. He thus became the 1st Earl of Desmond, but soon returned to England, where he died in obscurity.\n\nEarly life\nJames FitzGerald, the son of the 14th Earl and Eleanor Butler, was born during the earlier of the Desmond Rebellions; Queen Elizabeth of England was his godmother. He was resident in Ireland in 1579, when his father joined the later rebellion against the crown, and at that time his mother chose to deliver him to Sir William Drury, lord deputy of Ireland, who placed him in custody in Dublin Castle. In August 1582, his mother complained bitterly to Lord Burghley that her son's education was being neglected and sought better care for him. After the death of his fugitive father, FitzGerald's gaolers made a petition to the English government for his removal to the Tower of London. The petition was granted in 1584, and before the end of the year, he was removed to the Tower, where he remained for the next 16 years.\n\nCaptivity\nFitzGerald was the heir to the earldom of Desmond, but in 1585 his late father's estate was attainted by the Irish parliament and all its property confiscated by the crown. Most of the hereditary lands in the province of Munster then underwent a radical plantation by English settlers (see Plantation of Munster), but such was the loyalty attached to the FitzGerald name there that the government had good cause to fear a future rebellion. These events occurred during the Anglo-Spanish War (1585\u20131604), and English fear was increased with the prospect of an intervention by the Spanish, who had a historical affinity with the west coast of Ireland.\nIt was in this context that the young heir found himself nurtured in London, where he was to lead a miserable existence. He appears to have been sickly, as shown by the accounts kept between 1588 and 1598 of payments for medicines, ointments, pills and syrups administered to him. In 1593, he wrote in pathetic terms to the queen's secretary, Sir Robert Cecil, but the government really only had one use for him.\n\nIrish campaign\nIn 1600, during the Nine Years War (Ireland) and following hostile intrusions into Munster at the direction of Hugh O'Neill, 3rd Earl of Tyrone, it was suggested by Sir George Carew that FitzGerald be paraded through the province as the true Earl of Desmond, to counter the popularity of the pretender to the earldom, James FitzThomas FitzGerald, (known as the S\u00fag\u00e1n \u2013 i.e. Hayrope \u2013 Earl). The queen hesitated at this suggestion, but was convinced by Cecil that the risk was worth taking.\nA patent for the title of Earl of Desmond (the second creation) passed the great seal, without restoration of the confiscated lands and restricting any inheritance of the title; an allowance of \u00a3500 pa. was granted. FitzGerald was to remain in the custody of Captain Price and Miler Magrath, archbishop of Cashel; Price was charged with keeping him faithful to the queen and the Protestant religion, and was to maintain a frugal household. Carew was instructed by Cecil to keep FitzGerald under close observation, ready to arrest him if he showed sympathy with the rebels while allowing the appearance of liberty.\nFitzGerald's party set out from Bristol in October 1600, bound for Cork, but the prisoner suffered such a severe bout of sea-sickness that he had to be landed at Youghal in south Munster. He was received enthusiastically by the Geraldine supporters \u2013 though the mayor of Cork was not courteous \u2013 and was quickly transferred to Mallow, and then to Kilmallock in the heart of Desmond country, where he was given lodgings by the English commander Sir George Thornton. On his arrival he praised the queen's clemency and was well-liked; the next day \u2013 a Sunday \u2013 he ostentatiously made his way to the Protestant church, while his followers awaited him in the Catholic chapel, a disappointment for which he was instantly derided by the people. In November 1600 the fortress of Castlemaine was surrendered to FitzGerald by a servant of the S\u00fag\u00e1n Earl, but owing to his failure to command the allegiance of the people the government soon discarded the Desmond heir.\n\nDeath\nFitzGerald resented the meanness of his allowance and was forbidden by Cecil to marry the widow Norreys, since a better match in England was hoped for. In March 1601 he was brought to London with a letter from Carew recommending him for a grant of land and a settled income. In August he complained of being penniless and despised, and appealed to Cecil for some of the lands that had been held by the S\u00fag\u00e1n Earl. He died in London in early November 1601, but it was only in January 1602 that the death was announced. His guardians were then released from their charge, one of whom, William Power, wrote for pecuniary assistance for FitzGerald's four sisters.\n\nAncestry\nSources\nRichard Bagwell, Ireland under the Tudors 3 vols.

{"prompt": "Answer the question based on the given passages. Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\nTjuyu\nThuya (sometimes transliterated as Touiyou, Thuiu, Tuya, Tjuyu or Thuyu) was an Egyptian noblewoman and the mother of queen Tiye, and the wife of Yuya. She is the grandmother of Akhenaten, and great grandmother of Tutankhamun.\n\nBiography\nThuya is believed to be a descendant of Queen Ahmose-Nefertari, and she held many official roles in the interwoven religion and government of ancient Egypt. She was involved in many religious cults; her titles included 'Singer of Hathor' and 'Chief of the Entertainers' of both Amun and Min. She also held the influential offices of Superintendent of the Harem of the god Min of Akhmin and of Amun of Thebes.  She married Yuya, a powerful ancient Egyptian courtier of the Eighteenth Dynasty.  She is believed to have died in around 1375 BC in her early to mid 50s.\n\nChildren\nYuya and Thuya had a daughter named Tiye, who became the Great Royal Wife of Pharaoh Amenhotep III. The great royal wife was the highest Egyptian religious position, serving alongside of the pharaoh in official ceremonies and rituals.\nYuya and Thuya also had a son named Anen, who carried the titles Chancellor of Lower Egypt, Second Prophet of Amun, sm-priest of Heliopolis and Divine Father.They also may have been the parents of Ay, an Egyptian courtier active during the reign of pharaoh Akhenaten who became pharaoh after the death of Tutankhamun. However, there is no conclusive evidence regarding the kinship of Yuya and Ay, although certainly, both men came from Akhmim.\n\nTomb\nThuya was interred in tomb KV46 in the Valley of the Kings, together with her husband Yuya, where their largely intact burial was found in 1905. It was the best-preserved tomb discovered in the Valley before that of Tutankhamun, Thuya's great-grandson. The tomb was discovered by a team of workmen led by archaeologist James Quibell on behalf of the American millionaire Theodore M. Davis. Though the tomb had been robbed in antiquity, much of its contents were still present, including beds, boxes, chests, a chariot, and the sarcophagi, coffins, and mummies of the two occupants.Thuya's large gilded and black-painted wooden sarcophagus was placed against the south wall of the tomb. It is rectangular, with a lid shaped like the sloping roof of the per-wer shrine of Upper Egypt, and sits on ornamental sledge runners, their non-functionality underscored by the three battens attached below them. Ancient robbers had partially dismantled it to access her coffins and mummy, placing its lid and one long side on a bed on the other side of the tomb; the other long side had been leaned against the south wall. Her outer gilded anthropoid coffin had been removed, its lid placed atop the beds, and the trough put into the far corner of the tomb; the lid of her second (innermost) coffin, also gilded, had been removed and placed to one side although the trough and her mummy remained inside the sarcophagus. Quibell suggests this is due to the robbers having some difficulty in removing the lid of this coffin.\n\nMummy\nThuya's mummified body was found covered with a large sheet of linen, knotted at the back and secured by four bandages. These bands were covered with resin and opposite each band were her gilded titles cut from gold foil. The resin coating on the lower layers of bandages preserved the impression of a large broad collar. The mummy bands that had once covered her wrapped mummy were recovered above the storage jars on the far side of the room.The first examination of her body was conducted by Australian anatomist Grafton Elliot Smith. He found her to be an elderly woman of small stature, 1.495 metres (4.90 ft) in height, with white hair. Both of her earlobes had two piercings. Her arms are straight at her sides with her hands against the outside of her thighs. Her embalming incision is stitched with thread, to which a carnelian barrel bead is attached at the lower end; her body cavity is stuffed with resin-soaked linen. When Dr. Douglas Derry, (who later conducted the first examination of Tutankhamun's mummy) assisting Smith in his examination, exposed Thuya's feet to get an accurate measurement of her height, he found her to be wearing gold foil sandals. Smith estimated her age at more than 50 years based on her outward appearance alone. Recent CT scanning has estimated her age at death to be 50\u201360 years old. Her brain was removed, though no embalming material was inserted, and both nostrils were stuffed with linen. Embalming packs had been placed into her eye sockets, and subcutaneous filling had been placed into her mid and lower face to restore a lifelike appearance; embalming material had also been placed into her mouth and throat. Her teeth were in poor condition at the time of her death, with missing molars. Heavy wear and abscesses had been noted in earlier x-rays. The scan revealed that she had severe scoliosis with a Cobb angle of 25 degrees. No cause of death could be determined. Her mummy has the inventory number CG 51191.\n\nArchaeological items pertaining to Thuya\nPassage 2:\nKaoru Hatoyama\nKaoru Hatoyama (\u9ce9\u5c71 \u85ab, Hatoyama Kaoru, 21 November 1888 \u2013 15 August 1982) was an educator and an administrator, the schoolmaster of Kyoritsu Women's University, which was founded by her mother-in-law, Haruko Hatoyama. She is well known as the wife of Ichir\u014d Hatoyama, who was the 52nd\u201354th Prime Minister of Japan, serving terms from December 10, 1954 through December 23, 1956. She was the mother of Iichir\u014d Hatoyama, who was Japan's Foreign Minister from 1976 through 1977.\nAfter the elections of 2009, she became more widely known as the grandmother of Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama and his politician brother Kunio Hatoyama.\n\nSee also\nHatoyama Hall (Hatoyama Kaikan)\n\nNotes\nPassage 3:\nAnne Denman\nAnne Denman (1587\u20131661) was born in Olde Hall, Retford, Nottinghamshire. Through a second marriage with Thomas Aylesbury, she became the grandmother of Lady Anne Hyde, Duchess of York and great-grandmother of Queen Mary II and Queen Anne.\n\nEarly life\nAnne was born in Olde Hall, West Retford in around 1587. She was the younger daughter of Francis Denman of Retford and Anne (Blount) Denman. Francis (born c. 1531, died 1599) was the rector of West Retford, Notts from 1578. He was the second son of Anne Hercy by her first husband, Nicholas Denman esq of East Retford, Notts. Francis had several sons who pre-deceased him and left two daughters as his heirs: Barbara (born c. 1583) who married Edward Darell (born c. 1582); and Anne.Anne's nephew, Dr John Darrell, was the youngest child of Barbara Denman and Edward Darell, and inherited substantial properties from both the Denman and Darell families. In 1665 just before his death he made a will dividing his estate between three charities. He donated the childhood home of Anne and Barbara, Olde Hall, to create a hospital for elderly men (an alms house), which became the site for Trinity Hospital, Retford (a Grade II listed building).\n\nMarriages\nAnne was married at 20 and left a widow at 23 after the death of her first husband William, the younger son of Sir Thomas Darell. William was the half-brother of her sister Barbara's husband Edward.\nAnne left Retford due to some unknown trouble, or loss of fortune, in 1610 and proceeded to London by waggon-coach. Wilmshurst (1908) records that there had been a lawsuit between the two sisters in 1605.\nAfter reaching London, Anne is said to have halted at a hostel called the 'Goat and Compasses', where she rested before looking out for an occupation suitable for a country lady of good birth and family. The owner (not the landlord) of the hostel was Mr Thomas Aylesbury, a rich brewer of the Parish of St Andrew's, Holborn who happened to be making an inspection of his 'Houses' and required a housekeeper for his household, engaging Anne to this position. Thomas was a widower of 34, and a year later made Anne an offer of marriage.\n\nThe marriage of Anne and Thomas was recorded in the Bishop of London's Registry, dated 3 October 1611, giving the couple's address as St Andrew's, Holborn. The registry notes that the marriage has 'the consent of his father, William Aylesbury, Esquire'. She is described in the register as 'Anne Darell, of the City of London, widow, whose husband died a year before'. Edwin Wilmshurst (1908) notes that Anne's first husband, William Darrel is described as 'of London', and apparently died there. He says this suggests Anne 'may have become acquainted with Mr Thomas Aylesbury before she became so young a widow and he a widower'. He also comments that on 17 April 1611, there was a partition of Estate between Edward Darrel and Barbara his wife, and her sister Anne, by an Indenture. This took place while she was working for Thomas Aylesbury but before she married him.\nMarrying Thomas was fortunate for Anne, as in 1627, he was created a Baronet, Master of the Mint, and Master of the Requests, by Charles I. After the King's death, the family moved to Antwerp with other Royalists. During this time in exile, Barbara, Anne's daughter died. Lady Anne Hyde, Duchess of York, and granddaughter of Anne Denman, later noted in her pocket book that her aunt Barbara died in Antwerp in 1652 and unmarried. 'My dear Aunt Bab was, when she died, 24 years of age.'

Anne returned to London. Sir Thomas's will was in favour of Anne and her daughter Frances, but was disputed. Fortunately, Anne had the help of the eminent lawyer Edward Hyde (b. 18 February 1608/9 d. 1674) who was married to her daughter Frances. The deaths of Frances' brothers and sisters meant that by the time of her father's death she was the heiress for her father's estate.\n\nEdward Hyde\nEdward Hyde was Anne's son-in-law. The Registers of Westminster Abbey show that he married Frances, daughter of Sir Thomas Aylesbury and his wife Anne, at the Church of St Mar\u00adgaret's, Westminster (in which Parish Sir Thomas and Anne were resident), on 10 July 1634, under a Licence from the Dean and Chapter of Westminster, issued the same day. He was said to be 26 years of age having been born in the ninth year of King Charles' reign (1609), and was already a widower. He married his first wife Anne in 1629, and she died about six months later after catching smallpox. His second wife, Frances was about 21 upon her marriage.\n\nEdward Hyde had risen rapidly in his profession. When King Charles was at Oxford, he was knighted on 22 February 1642\u20133, and was then made Lord Chancellor and Privy Councillor at the age of 34. Upon King Charles' death, he had to flee from Puritan vengeance. He was with King Charles II in exile in Flanders, and in Bruges on 29 January 1657\u201358, he was again appointed Lord Chancellor in prospectu. With the restitution of the monarchy, Edward and Frances Hyde were now in high favour. For his long service to the King, and his fidelity to the Crown, Edward was created Baron Hyde of Hindon, Wiltshire in 1660. In 1661, he was raised to be Viscount Cornberry (in which year Frances died). He was later created Earl of Clarendon (1662), taking his title from the Estate and Park of Clarendon, near Salisbury.\nEdward and Frances had six children. Their daughter Lady Anne (1637\u20131671), married King James II/VII.\n\nDeath and burial\nAnne Denman is interred in the Hyde family vault in Westminster Abbey. She seems to have secured the regard of her grandson-in-law, James, Duke of York, as Samuel Pepys notes in his Diary that, in 1661, The Duke of York was in mourning for his wife's grandmother, who (he adds) was thought of with a great deal of fondness \u2014 and which grandmother was Anne Denman, of the Old Manor House, West Retford, Notts, now the Trinity Hospital.\n\nQueen Anne portrait\nAnne Denman's childhood home, the Old Hall in Retford, was given by her nephew John Darrell in his will to become a hospital for old men of good repute. As the last member of the Denman-Darrell family, he carried out the wishes of his father, Edward, in this respect. The Old Hall became Trinity Hospital, on Hospital Road, Retford. It is administered by a Trust which owns considerable property around Retford. A portrait of Queen Anne in Trinity Hospital was recently attributed (1999) by the auctioneers Phillips to Sir Godfrey Kneller. John was the nephew of Anne Denman, the first cousin of Frances Hyde, and therefore a cousin twice removed of Queen Anne.\n\n\n== Notes ==\nPassage 4:\nMona Hopton Bell\nMona Hopton Bell (1867\u20131940) was a British artist, best known for her portraits of civic figures.She was the grandmother of the painter Jean H.

She was member of the Tuscan branch of the Imperial House of Habsburg, an Archduchess of Austria and Princess of Tuscany by birth. After the fall of the Austro Hungary Empire, she lived under reduced circumstances with her family in Spain, Austria, and Italy. She died unmarried.\n\nEarly life\nArchduchess Dolores was born in Lemberg, Austria, the eldest child of Archduke Leopold Salvator of Austria (1863\u20131931) and of his wife Blanca de Borb\u00f3n y de Borb\u00f3n-Parma (1868\u20131949). Her mother was the eldest daughter of Carlos, Duke of Madrid, Carlist claimant to the throne of Spain. Dolores was given the baptismal names Maria de los Dolores Beatrix Carolina Blanca Leopoldina  von Habsburg-Lothringen.\nArchduchess Dolores grew up in the last period of the  Austrian-Hungarian Empire. She was educated in splendor. Her father, who had followed a career in the army, was also an inventor with a number of military patents under his name. Her mother was the domineering force in the family. Theirs was a multi-cultural household. Dolores's paternal ancestors had reigned in Austria, Tuscany and the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies. Her mother's family had reigned in Spain, Parma and France.\nArchduchess Dolores was educated with her sisters Immaculata and Margaretha. The three sisters, very close in age, were artistically inclined.  Dolores was particularity skillful at drawing. Her education emphasised languages, and in addition to her native German, she learned French, Spanish, Hungarian and Italian. The family was wealthy. They had the Palais Toskana in Vienna and Schloss Wilhelminenberg as their country state. Vacations were spent in Italy where Infanta Blanca owned a rural property near Viareggio. During World War I, Archduchess Dolores's father and two eldest brothers fought with the Austro-Hungarian army.\n\nExile\nAt the fall of Habsburg monarchy, the republican government of Austria confiscated all the properties of the Habsburgs. Dolores' family lost all their fortune. Her two eldest brothers, Archdukes Rainer and Leopold, decided to remain in Austria and recognized the new republic. Dolores with her parents and her other siblings emigrated to Spain. In January  1919 they arrived in Barcelona where they settled for over a decade. They lived modestly. While in Wilhelminenberg the family employed no less than 80 servants to attend their large household, by contrast in Barcelona, Dolores her mother and sisters had to fence for themselves doing the house chores. With income from her father's military patents in France and with the sell of some of her mother jewels they were able to buy a house in Barcelona. Archduchess Dolores remained unmarried. She was mildly handicapped by a limp since childhood.\nThe convulsed political situation in Spain during  the Second Spanish Republic made the family returned to Austria. They were able to rent three rooms at their former residence in Vienna, the Palais Toskana. In March 1938 Hitler annexed Austria and Archduchess Dolores with her mother and youngest brother moved to Tenuta Reale, a villa belonging to his mother's family near Viareggio in Italy. As the situation there became increasingly dire due to the war, Archduchess Dolores her mother, her youngest brother, Archduke Karl, and his family moved back to  Barcelona. When the war ended they returned to Viareggio.\nAfter the death of her mother, Archduchess Dolores returned to live in Barcelona. In the 1960s her family lost contact with her. It was later discovered that she was living in Lleida being held in semi imprisonment by the family of the postman who used to deliver her letters. They were trying to get hold on her inheritance. Rescued by her sister Margaretha, Dolores remained at Tenuta Reale for the rest of her life living with her sisters  Margaretha and Immaculata who were by then widows. She died on 10 April 1974 at age 82 at Viareggio, Italy.\n\nAncestry\nNotes\nBibliography\nHarding, Bertita. Lost Waltz: A Story of Exile. Bobbs-Merrill, 1944. ASIN: B0007DXCLY\nMcIntosh, David.

She married Qusai ibn Kilab and after her father died, the keys of the Kaaba were committed to her. Qusai, according to Hulail's will, had the trusteeship of the Kaaba after him.\nHubbah never gave up ambitious hopes for the line of her favourite son Abd Manaf. Her two favourite grandsons were the twin sons Amr and Abd Shams, of \u2018\u0100tikah bint Murrah. Hubbah hoped that the opportunities missed by Abd Manaf would be made up for in these grandsons, especially Amr, who seemed much more suitable for the role than any of the sons of Abd al-Dar. He was dear to the \u2018ayn (Arabic: \u0639\u0640\u064a\u0640\u0646, eye) of his grandmother Hubbah.\n\nFamily\nQusai ibn Kilab had four sons by Hubbah: Abd-al-Dar ibn Qusai dedicated to his house, Abdu\u2019l Qusayy dedicated to himself, Abd-al-Uzza ibn Qusai to his goddess (Al-\u2018Uzz\u00e1) and Abd Manaf ibn Qusai to the idol revered by Hubbah. They also had two daughters, Takhmur and Barrah. Abd Manaf's real name was 'Mughirah', and he also had the nickname 'al-Qamar' (the Moon) because he was handsome.\nHubbah was related to Muhammad in more than one way. Firstly, she was the great-great-grandmother of his father Abdullah. She was also the great-grandmother of Umm Habib and Abdul-Uzza, respectively the maternal grandmother and grandfather of Muhammad's mother Aminah.\n\nFamily tree\n* indicates that the marriage order is disputed\nNote that direct lineage is marked in bold.\n\nSee also\nFamily tree of Muhammad\nList of notable Hijazis\nPassage 8:\nArchduchess Maria Carolina of Austria (1740\u20131741)\nArchduchess Maria Carolina of Austria (Maria Carolina Ernestina Antoina Johanna Josefa; 12 January 1740 \u2013 25 January 1741) was the third child and daughter of Maria Theresa, Holy Roman Empress, and Francis I, Holy Roman Emperor.\n\nBiography\nIn Maria Theresa's third pregnancy, expectations for a male heir were intense. The disappointment was correspondingly great when, on 12 January 1740, a third daughter was born. She was immediately baptized on the evening of her birth.\nAfter the death of her older sister Maria Elisabeth on 7 June, she became second in the line of succession, preceded only by her older sister Maria Anna. Five months later, on 20 October, her grandfather Emperor Charles VI died and her mother inherited the Austrian and Bohemian lands, and with this began the War of the Austrian Succession.\nOn 24 January 1741, the young Archduchess suddenly became gravely ill with violent seizures, dying around noon of the next day. The cause of death was believed to be either tetany or spasmophilia; however, at the time of her death an autopsy was carried out on the corpse, but no explanation was given for her demise. She was buried in the Maria Theresa Vault at the Imperial Crypt, Vienna.\nTwo other sisters were named after her: another short-lived one (born and died in 1748) and another (born in 1752), later Queen of Naples and Sicily.\n\nAncestry\nPassage 9:\nHannah Arnold\nHannah Arnold may refer to:\n\nHannah Arnold (n\u00e9e Waterman) (c.1705\u20131758), mother of Benedict Arnold\nHannah Arnold (beauty queen) (born 1996), Filipino-Australian model and beauty pageant titleholder\nPassage 10:\nDiana Guardato\nDiana Guardato was a member of the aristocratic Patrician Guardato family.

She is the grandmother of Akhenaten, and great grandmother of Tutankhamun.\n\nBiography\nThuya is believed to be a descendant of Queen Ahmose-Nefertari, and she held many official roles in the interwoven religion and government of ancient Egypt. She was involved in many religious cults; her titles included 'Singer of Hathor' and 'Chief of the Entertainers' of both Amun and Min. She also held the influential offices of Superintendent of the Harem of the god Min of Akhmin and of Amun of Thebes.  She married Yuya, a powerful ancient Egyptian courtier of the Eighteenth Dynasty.  She is believed to have died in around 1375 BC in her early to mid 50s.\n\nChildren\nYuya and Thuya had a daughter named Tiye, who became the Great Royal Wife of Pharaoh Amenhotep III. The great royal wife was the highest Egyptian religious position, serving alongside of the pharaoh in official ceremonies and rituals.\nYuya and Thuya also had a son named Anen, who carried the titles Chancellor of Lower Egypt, Second Prophet of Amun, sm-priest of Heliopolis and Divine Father.They also may have been the parents of Ay, an Egyptian courtier active during the reign of pharaoh Akhenaten who became pharaoh after the death of Tutankhamun. However, there is no conclusive evidence regarding the kinship of Yuya and Ay, although certainly, both men came from Akhmim.\n\nTomb\nThuya was interred in tomb KV46 in the Valley of the Kings, together with her husband Yuya, where their largely intact burial was found in 1905. It was the best-preserved tomb discovered in the Valley before that of Tutankhamun, Thuya's great-grandson. The tomb was discovered by a team of workmen led by archaeologist James Quibell on behalf of the American millionaire Theodore M. Davis. Though the tomb had been robbed in antiquity, much of its contents were still present, including beds, boxes, chests, a chariot, and the sarcophagi, coffins, and mummies of the two occupants.Thuya's large gilded and black-painted wooden sarcophagus was placed against the south wall of the tomb. It is rectangular, with a lid shaped like the sloping roof of the per-wer shrine of Upper Egypt, and sits on ornamental sledge runners, their non-functionality underscored by the three battens attached below them. Ancient robbers had partially dismantled it to access her coffins and mummy, placing its lid and one long side on a bed on the other side of the tomb; the other long side had been leaned against the south wall. Her outer gilded anthropoid coffin had been removed, its lid placed atop the beds, and the trough put into the far corner of the tomb; the lid of her second (innermost) coffin, also gilded, had been removed and placed to one side although the trough and her mummy remained inside the sarcophagus. Quibell suggests this is due to the robbers having some difficulty in removing the lid of this coffin.\n\nMummy\nThuya's mummified body was found covered with a large sheet of linen, knotted at the back and secured by four bandages. These bands were covered with resin and opposite each band were her gilded titles cut from gold foil. The resin coating on the lower layers of bandages preserved the impression of a large broad collar. The mummy bands that had once covered her wrapped mummy were recovered above the storage jars on the far side of the room.The first examination of her body was conducted by Australian anatomist Grafton Elliot Smith. He found her to be an elderly woman of small stature, 1.495 metres (4.90 ft) in height, with white hair. Both of her earlobes had two piercings. Her arms are straight at her sides with her hands against the outside of her thighs. Her embalming incision is stitched with thread, to which a carnelian barrel bead is attached at the lower end; her body cavity is stuffed with resin-soaked linen. When Dr. Douglas Derry, (who later conducted the first examination of Tutankhamun's mummy) assisting Smith in his examination, exposed Thuya's feet to get an accurate measurement of her height, he found her to be wearing gold foil sandals. Smith estimated her age at more than 50 years based on her outward appearance alone. Recent CT scanning has estimated her age at death to be 50\u201360 years old. Her brain was removed, though no embalming material was inserted, and both nostrils were stuffed with linen. Embalming packs had been placed into her eye sockets, and subcutaneous filling had been placed into her mid and lower face to restore a lifelike appearance; embalming material had also been placed into her mouth and throat. Her teeth were in poor condition at the time of her death, with missing molars. Heavy wear and abscesses had been noted in earlier x-rays. The scan revealed that she had severe scoliosis with a Cobb angle of 25 degrees. No cause of death could be determined. Her mummy has the inventory number CG 51191.\n\nArchaeological items pertaining to Thuya\nPassage 2:\nKaoru Hatoyama\nKaoru Hatoyama (\u9ce9\u5c71 \u85ab, Hatoyama Kaoru, 21 November 1888 \u2013 15 August 1982) was an educator and an administrator, the schoolmaster of Kyoritsu Women's University, which was founded by her mother-in-law, Haruko Hatoyama. She is well known as the wife of Ichir\u014d Hatoyama, who was the 52nd\u201354th Prime Minister of Japan, serving terms from December 10, 1954 through December 23, 1956. She was the mother of Iichir\u014d Hatoyama, who was Japan's Foreign Minister from 1976 through 1977.\nAfter the elections of 2009, she became more widely known as the grandmother of Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama and his politician brother Kunio Hatoyama.\n\nSee also\nHatoyama Hall (Hatoyama Kaikan)\n\nNotes\nPassage 3:\nAnne Denman\nAnne Denman (1587\u20131661) was born in Olde Hall, Retford, Nottinghamshire. Through a second marriage with Thomas Aylesbury, she became the grandmother of Lady Anne Hyde, Duchess of York and great-grandmother of Queen Mary II and Queen Anne.\n\nEarly life\nAnne was born in Olde Hall, West Retford in around 1587. She was the younger daughter of Francis Denman of Retford and Anne (Blount) Denman. Francis (born c. 1531, died 1599) was the rector of West Retford, Notts from 1578. He was the second son of Anne Hercy by her first husband, Nicholas Denman esq of East Retford, Notts. Francis had several sons who pre-deceased him and left two daughters as his heirs: Barbara (born c. 1583) who married Edward Darell (born c. 1582); and Anne.Anne's nephew, Dr John Darrell, was the youngest child of Barbara Denman and Edward Darell, and inherited substantial properties from both the Denman and Darell families. In 1665 just before his death he made a will dividing his estate between three charities. He donated the childhood home of Anne and Barbara, Olde Hall, to create a hospital for elderly men (an alms house), which became the site for Trinity Hospital, Retford (a Grade II listed building).\n\nMarriages\nAnne was married at 20 and left a widow at 23 after the death of her first husband William, the younger son of Sir Thomas Darell. William was the half-brother of her sister Barbara's husband Edward.\nAnne left Retford due to some unknown trouble, or loss of fortune, in 1610 and proceeded to London by waggon-coach. Wilmshurst (1908) records that there had been a lawsuit between the two sisters in 1605.\nAfter reaching London, Anne is said to have halted at a hostel called the 'Goat and Compasses', where she rested before looking out for an occupation suitable for a country lady of good birth and family. The owner (not the landlord) of the hostel was Mr Thomas Aylesbury, a rich brewer of the Parish of St Andrew's, Holborn who happened to be making an inspection of his 'Houses' and required a housekeeper for his household, engaging Anne to this position. Thomas was a widower of 34, and a year later made Anne an offer of marriage.\n\nThe marriage of Anne and Thomas was recorded in the Bishop of London's Registry, dated 3 October 1611, giving the couple's address as St Andrew's, Holborn. The registry notes that the marriage has 'the consent of his father, William Aylesbury, Esquire'. She is described in the register as 'Anne Darell, of the City of London, widow, whose husband died a year before'. Edwin Wilmshurst (1908) notes that Anne's first husband, William Darrel is described as 'of London', and apparently died there. He says this suggests Anne 'may have become acquainted with Mr Thomas Aylesbury before she became so young a widow and he a widower'. He also comments that on 17 April 1611, there was a partition of Estate between Edward Darrel and Barbara his wife, and her sister Anne, by an Indenture. This took place while she was working for Thomas Aylesbury but before she married him.\nMarrying Thomas was fortunate for Anne, as in 1627, he was created a Baronet, Master of the Mint, and Master of the Requests, by Charles I. After the King's death, the family moved to Antwerp with other Royalists. During this time in exile, Barbara, Anne's daughter died. Lady Anne Hyde, Duchess of York, and granddaughter of Anne Denman, later noted in her pocket book that her aunt Barbara died in Antwerp in 1652 and unmarried. 'My dear Aunt Bab was, when she died, 24 years of age.' Barbara, when in exile in Holland, was attached to the then Princess of Orange, as a lady in waiting at the Hague.\n\nChildren\nThe issue of Anne Denman's marriage with Thomas Aylesbury were:\n\nWilliam baptised in 1612 at St Margaret's Lothbury in London, died in Jamaica in 1656\nThomas (probably died young)\nFrances born 1617 died 1667, married Edward Hyde in 1634, had issue\nLady Anne (1637\u20131671), married King James II/VII\nHon.

Anne returned to London. Sir Thomas's will was in favour of Anne and her daughter Frances, but was disputed. Fortunately, Anne had the help of the eminent lawyer Edward Hyde (b. 18 February 1608/9 d. 1674) who was married to her daughter Frances. The deaths of Frances' brothers and sisters meant that by the time of her father's death she was the heiress for her father's estate.\n\nEdward Hyde\nEdward Hyde was Anne's son-in-law. The Registers of Westminster Abbey show that he married Frances, daughter of Sir Thomas Aylesbury and his wife Anne, at the Church of St Mar\u00adgaret's, Westminster (in which Parish Sir Thomas and Anne were resident), on 10 July 1634, under a Licence from the Dean and Chapter of Westminster, issued the same day. He was said to be 26 years of age having been born in the ninth year of King Charles' reign (1609), and was already a widower. He married his first wife Anne in 1629, and she died about six months later after catching smallpox. His second wife, Frances was about 21 upon her marriage.\n\nEdward Hyde had risen rapidly in his profession. When King Charles was at Oxford, he was knighted on 22 February 1642\u20133, and was then made Lord Chancellor and Privy Councillor at the age of 34. Upon King Charles' death, he had to flee from Puritan vengeance. He was with King Charles II in exile in Flanders, and in Bruges on 29 January 1657\u201358, he was again appointed Lord Chancellor in prospectu. With the restitution of the monarchy, Edward and Frances Hyde were now in high favour. For his long service to the King, and his fidelity to the Crown, Edward was created Baron Hyde of Hindon, Wiltshire in 1660. In 1661, he was raised to be Viscount Cornberry (in which year Frances died). He was later created Earl of Clarendon (1662), taking his title from the Estate and Park of Clarendon, near Salisbury.\nEdward and Frances had six children. Their daughter Lady Anne (1637\u20131671), married King James II/VII.\n\nDeath and burial\nAnne Denman is interred in the Hyde family vault in Westminster Abbey. She seems to have secured the regard of her grandson-in-law, James, Duke of York, as Samuel Pepys notes in his Diary that, in 1661, The Duke of York was in mourning for his wife's grandmother, who (he adds) was thought of with a great deal of fondness \u2014 and which grandmother was Anne Denman, of the Old Manor House, West Retford, Notts, now the Trinity Hospital.\n\nQueen Anne portrait\nAnne Denman's childhood home, the Old Hall in Retford, was given by her nephew John Darrell in his will to become a hospital for old men of good repute. As the last member of the Denman-Darrell family, he carried out the wishes of his father, Edward, in this respect. The Old Hall became Trinity Hospital, on Hospital Road, Retford. It is administered by a Trust which owns considerable property around Retford. A portrait of Queen Anne in Trinity Hospital was recently attributed (1999) by the auctioneers Phillips to Sir Godfrey Kneller. John was the nephew of Anne Denman, the first cousin of Frances Hyde, and therefore a cousin twice removed of Queen Anne.\n\n\n== Notes ==\nPassage 4:\nMona Hopton Bell\nMona Hopton Bell (1867\u20131940) was a British artist, best known for her portraits of civic figures.She was the grandmother of the painter Jean H.

She was member of the Tuscan branch of the Imperial House of Habsburg, an Archduchess of Austria and Princess of Tuscany by birth. After the fall of the Austro Hungary Empire, she lived under reduced circumstances with her family in Spain, Austria, and Italy. She died unmarried.\n\nEarly life\nArchduchess Dolores was born in Lemberg, Austria, the eldest child of Archduke Leopold Salvator of Austria (1863\u20131931) and of his wife Blanca de Borb\u00f3n y de Borb\u00f3n-Parma (1868\u20131949). Her mother was the eldest daughter of Carlos, Duke of Madrid, Carlist claimant to the throne of Spain. Dolores was given the baptismal names Maria de los Dolores Beatrix Carolina Blanca Leopoldina  von Habsburg-Lothringen.\nArchduchess Dolores grew up in the last period of the  Austrian-Hungarian Empire. She was educated in splendor. Her father, who had followed a career in the army, was also an inventor with a number of military patents under his name. Her mother was the domineering force in the family. Theirs was a multi-cultural household. Dolores's paternal ancestors had reigned in Austria, Tuscany and the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies. Her mother's family had reigned in Spain, Parma and France.\nArchduchess Dolores was educated with her sisters Immaculata and Margaretha. The three sisters, very close in age, were artistically inclined.  Dolores was particularity skillful at drawing. Her education emphasised languages, and in addition to her native German, she learned French, Spanish, Hungarian and Italian. The family was wealthy. They had the Palais Toskana in Vienna and Schloss Wilhelminenberg as their country state. Vacations were spent in Italy where Infanta Blanca owned a rural property near Viareggio. During World War I, Archduchess Dolores's father and two eldest brothers fought with the Austro-Hungarian army.\n\nExile\nAt the fall of Habsburg monarchy, the republican government of Austria confiscated all the properties of the Habsburgs. Dolores' family lost all their fortune. Her two eldest brothers, Archdukes Rainer and Leopold, decided to remain in Austria and recognized the new republic. Dolores with her parents and her other siblings emigrated to Spain. In January  1919 they arrived in Barcelona where they settled for over a decade. They lived modestly. While in Wilhelminenberg the family employed no less than 80 servants to attend their large household, by contrast in Barcelona, Dolores her mother and sisters had to fence for themselves doing the house chores. With income from her father's military patents in France and with the sell of some of her mother jewels they were able to buy a house in Barcelona. Archduchess Dolores remained unmarried. She was mildly handicapped by a limp since childhood.\nThe convulsed political situation in Spain during  the Second Spanish Republic made the family returned to Austria. They were able to rent three rooms at their former residence in Vienna, the Palais Toskana. In March 1938 Hitler annexed Austria and Archduchess Dolores with her mother and youngest brother moved to Tenuta Reale, a villa belonging to his mother's family near Viareggio in Italy. As the situation there became increasingly dire due to the war, Archduchess Dolores her mother, her youngest brother, Archduke Karl, and his family moved back to  Barcelona. When the war ended they returned to Viareggio.\nAfter the death of her mother, Archduchess Dolores returned to live in Barcelona. In the 1960s her family lost contact with her. It was later discovered that she was living in Lleida being held in semi imprisonment by the family of the postman who used to deliver her letters. They were trying to get hold on her inheritance. Rescued by her sister Margaretha, Dolores remained at Tenuta Reale for the rest of her life living with her sisters  Margaretha and Immaculata who were by then widows. She died on 10 April 1974 at age 82 at Viareggio, Italy.\n\nAncestry\nNotes\nBibliography\nHarding, Bertita. Lost Waltz: A Story of Exile. Bobbs-Merrill, 1944. ASIN: B0007DXCLY\nMcIntosh, David.

Qusai, according to Hulail's will, had the trusteeship of the Kaaba after him.\nHubbah never gave up ambitious hopes for the line of her favourite son Abd Manaf. Her two favourite grandsons were the twin sons Amr and Abd Shams, of \u2018\u0100tikah bint Murrah. Hubbah hoped that the opportunities missed by Abd Manaf would be made up for in these grandsons, especially Amr, who seemed much more suitable for the role than any of the sons of Abd al-Dar.

Abd Manaf's real name was 'Mughirah', and he also had the nickname 'al-Qamar' (the Moon) because he was handsome.\nHubbah was related to Muhammad in more than one way. Firstly, she was the great-great-grandmother of his father Abdullah. She was also the great-grandmother of Umm Habib and Abdul-Uzza, respectively the maternal grandmother and grandfather of Muhammad's mother Aminah.\n\nFamily tree\n* indicates that the marriage order is disputed\nNote that direct lineage is marked in bold.\n\nSee also\nFamily tree of Muhammad\nList of notable Hijazis\nPassage 8:\nArchduchess Maria Carolina of Austria (1740\u20131741)\nArchduchess Maria Carolina of Austria (Maria Carolina Ernestina Antoina Johanna Josefa; 12 January 1740 \u2013 25 January 1741) was the third child and daughter of Maria Theresa, Holy Roman Empress, and Francis I, Holy Roman Emperor.\n\nBiography\nIn Maria Theresa's third pregnancy, expectations for a male heir were intense.

The cause of death was believed to be either tetany or spasmophilia; however, at the time of her death an autopsy was carried out on the corpse, but no explanation was given for her demise. She was buried in the Maria Theresa Vault at the Imperial Crypt, Vienna.\nTwo other sisters were named after her: another short-lived one (born and died in 1748) and another (born in 1752), later Queen of Naples and Sicily.\n\nAncestry\nPassage 9:\nHannah Arnold\nHannah Arnold may refer to:\n\nHannah Arnold (n\u00e9e Waterman) (c.1705\u20131758), mother of Benedict Arnold\nHannah Arnold (beauty queen) (born 1996), Filipino-Australian model and beauty pageant titleholder\nPassage 10:\nDiana Guardato\nDiana Guardato was a member of the aristocratic Patrician Guardato family.
