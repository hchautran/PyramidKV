Henry was the son of Herman I, count of Gleiberg. Henry was a follower of Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor. He had lands in the southeastern Eifel and on the Moselle River.\nMost of the holdings of Hermann II, Count Palatine fell back to the emperor, when Hermann died without successor. The emperor named Henry count palatine of the Rhine and during the emperor's trip to Italy tasked Henry to hold interim judicial councils. Henry married Herman's widow, Adelaide of Weimar-Orlam\u00fcnde (d. 1100). From this marriage, Henry may have taken control over some of her holdings along the Moselle. As a consequence, the geographic center of the palatinate moved towards the south.\nWith his wife, Adelaide, Henry founded the Maria Laach Abbey. He was succeeded by his stepson, Siegfried of Ballenstedt.\nPassage 3:\nHermann II, Count Palatine of Lotharingia\nHermann II (born 1049; died Dalhem, 20 September 1085), Count Palatine of Lotharingia 1064\u20131085. He was count in the Ruhrgau and the Zulpichgau, as well as a count of Brabant.\n\nLife\nAccording to Egon Kimpen he was the son of Henry I of Lotharingia (\u2020 1061) and Mathild of Verdun (\u2020 1060), daughter of Gozelo I of Lotharingia, but the basis for this has been questioned. However, if that is the case, his maternal uncle was Pope Stephen IX. Until 1064, young Hermann was under the guardianship of Anno II, Archbishop of Cologne, who significantly reduced Hermann's territorial power.\nIn 1080 he married Adelaide of Weimar-Orlam\u00fcnde (\u2020 1100), widow of Adalbert II, Count of Ballenstedt.

His elder brother was Joseph Charles, Count Palatine of Sulzbach.\n\nLife\nAfter the death of his elder brother Joseph Charles, John Christian Joseph became the eventual designated heir of the Electoral Palatine. In 1732 he succeeded his father as Count Palatine of Sulzbach, but died in Sulzbach in 1733 before inheriting the Palatinate.\nCharles III Philip, Elector Palatine, a member of the Palatine Neuburg line of Wittelsbach failed to produce a legitimate male heir, and his brothers also. By 1716 it was evident that the Neuburg line would become extinct and that the Sulzbach branch would succeed them.\n\nMarriage\nHe married twice:\n\nMarie Anne Henri\u00ebtte Leopoldine de La Tour d'Auvergne (24 October 1708 \u2013 28 July 1728), daughter of Francois Egon de la Tour d'Auvergne, Prince of Auvergne, and had the following children:Charles Theodore (11 December 1724 \u2013 16 February 1799); became Elector Palatine in 1742, and Elector of Bavaria in 1777\nMaria Anne (30 May 1728 \u2013 25 June 1728)Eleonore Philippina Christina Sophia of Hesse-Rotenburg  (1712-1759); married on 1731 but had no issue.\n\n\n== Ancestry ==\nPassage 5:\nPhilip William August, Count Palatine of Neuburg\nPhilip William August, Count Palatine of Neuburg (born 19 November 1668 in Neuburg an der Donau; died: 5 April 1693 in Z\u00e1kupy (German: Reichstadt)) was a  Prince and Count Palatine of Neuburg.\n\nLife\nPhilip William August was the 13th from a total of 17 children of Elector Palatine Philip William (1615-1690) from his second marriage to Elisabeth Amalie (1635-1709), a daughter of Landgrave George II of Hesse-Darmstadt.\nHis oldest sister, Eleonor Magdalene married Emperor Leopold I in 1676.  In August 1689, after he had visited his brother in Breslau and his sister in Vienna, Philip William began his Grand Tour to Italy.\nPhilip William August chose a secular career and entered into active military service.

He was the son of Hezzelin I, Count in Z\u00fclpichgau, and a member of the Ezzonid dynasty. Historians have given several nicknames to Heinrich: Furiosus (the Violent/the Insane), because he murdered his wife, and Monachus (the Monk), because he was confined into an abbey to treat his insanity.\n\nLife\nHenry was the son of Hezzelin I and his unnamed wife, who was probably a daughter of  Conrad I of Carinthia.Around 1048 Henry married Mathilda of Verdun (born abt 1025, died 27 July 1060), daughter of Duke Gozelo of Lotharingia, and sister of pope Stephen IX.\nHe received the Mosellan castle of Cochem from his niece, Queen Richeza of Poland. He was elected as successor for the German kingdom during Emperor Henry III's illness.\nShortly after 1058, Henry began to show signs of insanity, for which he was confined to the abbey of Gorze. He escaped however, and thinking that his wife Matilda had been unfaithful to him, he killed her (27 July 1060). Henry then was definitely enclosed into the abbey of Echternach, where he died in 1061. His office and counties were confiscated by Anno II, archbishop of Cologne, who became the guardian of their only son, the later count palatine Hermann II (1064-1085).\nPassage 7:\nRudolph II, Count Palatine of T\u00fcbingen\nRudolph II, Count Palatine of T\u00fcbingen (died 1 November 1247) was Count Palatine of T\u00fcbingen and Vogt of Sindelfingen.  He was the younger son of Rudolph I and his wife Matilda of Gleiberg, heiress of Giessen.\n\nLife\nRudolph II inherited the County Palatine of T\u00fcbingen when his elder brother Hugo III died in 1216.  From 1224 onwards, he is described as Count Palatine in many imperial documents, while his younger brother William is merely styled as Count.  Rudolph II supported Bebenhausen Abbey, which his parents had founded. \nNext to his father, Rudolph II is the second most mentioned Count Palatine of T\u00fcbingen in imperial documents, mostly in documents by King Henry (VII) of Germany, the son of Emperor Frederick II, who had been elected King of Germany in 1220, at the age of 8.  Frederick II spent much of his time in Italy, leaving his ancestral Swabia in the hands of his son.  Later, in 1232, Henry revolted against his father, and did everything in his power to win the Swabian nobility over to his side.  Rudolph II appears to have been among the noblemen who sided with Henry VII, at least, he is mentioned in 10 different documents of Henry VII and never by Frederick II.  Considering Rudolph's energetic character, one can assume that he intended to use the conflict between Henry VII and Frederick II to expand his own power and aim at an independent position.Swabian noblemen, including Rudolph II and his brother William, Count Hartmann I of W\u00fcrttemberg and a Count of Dillingen, visited Henry VII in Worms on 8 January 1224.  They met Margrave Herman V of Baden was also present, as was Eberhard, S\u00e9n\u00e9chal of Waldburg and councillor and former guardian of Henry VII in Oppenheim on 5 April 1227 and in Hagenau on 1 May.  In the same year, Rudolph met Duke Louis I of Bavaria, who was an imperial vicar and Conrad of Winterstetten, who was imperial cup-bearer and also a councilor of Henry VII.  He met the Lords of Neuffen and the imperial marshal Anselm of Justingen in Ulm on 23 February 1228.  On 31 August 1228, Rudolph II appears, together with Margrave Herman V of Baden, Count Henry of Wirtemberg, a Count of Dillingen, Conrad of Weinsperg and the councillors mentioned above, as witnesses of a deed in which King henry VII confirms the privileges of Adelber Abbey in Esslingen.  Later that year, Rudolph II appeared as a witness in four deed by Duke Louis I of Bavaria and Bishop Ekbert of Bamberg, together with, among others, Margrave Herman V of Baden, Count Ulrich and Eberhard of Helfenstein, Counts Eberhard and Otto of Eberstein, Count Gottfried of Hohenlohe, and two councilors.Rudolph II stood at the head of a delegation of eight Swabian counts, among them Albert IV of Habsburg, Frederick IV of Zollern and a Count of Eberstein, at the Imperial Diet in Worms on 29 April 1231.  On 22 November 1231, Rudolph II and his brother William met Counts Albert of Rottenburg, Ulrich of Hefenstein and Eberhard of Walpurg at Henry VII's castle in Ulm.  On 31 December 1231, Rudolph witnessed a deed benefiting Neresheim Abbey in Wimpfen, together with Duke Conrad I of Teck and Margrave Hermann V of Baden.  The last time Rudolph II witnessed a deed of Henry VII was on 4 June 1233 in Esslingen, again with his brother William.In 1235, Pope Gregory IX called on the princes of the empire to organize a new crusade into the Holy Land, to render assistance to the beleaguered church there.  Rudolph II is the only Swabian nobleman named in this call to arms; whether he actually went to the Holy Land is unknown.  The fact that he is not mentioned in any deed between 1235 and 1243 suggests that he may have been absent for an extended period.  In particular, no mention is made of his position in the struggle between King Conrad IV of Germany and anti-King Henry Raspe IV, which is remarkable, since this struggle took place mainly in Swabia.  However, a deed in favour of Bebenhausen Abbey which the papal legate made at Rudolph II's request in the army camp outside Ulm on 28 January 1247, suggests that he supported Henry Raspe.\n\nFamily\nThe name of Rudolph II's wife has not been preserved.  She was a daughter of a Margrave Henry from the House of Ronsberg and Udilhild of Gammertingen. They had the following children:\n\nHugo IV, Count Palatine of T\u00fcbingen\nRudolf III of Scheer (d. 12 May 1277), Count of T\u00fcbingen-Herrenberg\nUlrich\nMathilda, married Burchard II, Count of Hohenberg (d. 14 July 1253, struck by lightning).

{"prompt": "Answer the question based on the given passages. Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\nBrian Kennedy (gallery director)\nBrian Patrick Kennedy (born 5 November 1961) is an Irish-born art museum director who has worked in Ireland and Australia, and now lives and works in the United States.  He was the director of the Peabody Essex Museum in Salem for 17 months, resigning December 31, 2020. He was the director of the Toledo Museum of Art in Ohio from 2010 to 2019. He was the director of the Hood Museum of Art from 2005 to 2010, and the National Gallery of Australia (Canberra) from 1997 to 2004.\n\nCareer\nBrian Kennedy currently lives and works in the United States after leaving Australia in 2005 to direct the Hood Museum of Art at Dartmouth College. In October 2010 he became the ninth Director of the Toledo Museum of Art. On 1 July 2019, he succeeded Dan Monroe as the executive director and CEO of the Peabody Essex Museum.\n\nEarly life and career in Ireland\nKennedy was born in Dublin and attended Clonkeen College. He received B.A. (1982), M.A. (1985) and PhD (1989) degrees from University College-Dublin, where he studied both art history and history.\nHe worked in the Irish Department of Education (1982), the European Commission, Brussels (1983), and in Ireland at the Chester Beatty Library (1983\u201385), Government Publications Office (1985\u201386), and Department of Finance (1986\u201389). He married Mary Fiona Carlin in 1988.He was Assistant Director at the National Gallery of Ireland in Dublin from 1989 to 1997. He was Chair of the Irish Association of Art Historians from 1996 to 1997, and of the Council of Australian Art Museum Directors from 2001 to 2003. In September 1997 he became Director of the National Gallery of Australia.\n\nNational Gallery of Australia (NGA)\nKennedy expanded the traveling exhibitions and loans program throughout Australia, arranged for several major shows of Australian art abroad, increased the number of exhibitions at the museum itself and oversaw the development of an extensive multi-media site.  Although he oversaw several years of the museum's highest ever annual visitation, he discontinued the emphasis of his predecessor, Betty Churcher, on showing \"blockbuster\" exhibitions.\nDuring his directorship, the NGA gained government support for improving the building and significant private donations and corporate sponsorship. However, the initial design for the building proved controversial generating a public dispute with the original architect on moral rights grounds.  As a result, the project was not delivered during Dr Kennedy's tenure, with a significantly altered design completed some years later.  Private funding supported two acquisitions of British art, including David Hockney's A Bigger Grand Canyon in 1999, and Lucian Freud's After C\u00e9zanne in 2001. Kennedy built on the established collections at the museum by acquiring the Holmgren-Spertus collection of Indonesian textiles; the Kenneth Tyler collection of editioned prints, screens, multiples and unique proofs; and the Australian Print Workshop Archive. He was also notable for campaigning for the construction of a new \"front\" entrance to the Gallery, facing King Edward Terrace, which was completed in 2010 (see reference to the building project above).\nKennedy's cancellation of the \"Sensation exhibition\" (scheduled at the NGA from 2 June 2000 to 13 August 2000) was controversial, and seen by some as censorship. He claimed that the decision was due to the exhibition being \"too close to the market\" implying that a national cultural institution cannot exhibit the private collection of a speculative art investor. However, there were other exhibitions at the NGA during his tenure, which could have raised similar concerns. The exhibition featured the privately owned Young British Artists works belonging to Charles Saatchi and attracted large attendances in London and Brooklyn. Its most controversial work was Chris Ofili's The Holy Virgin Mary, a painting which used elephant dung and was accused of being blasphemous. The then-mayor of New York, Rudolph Giuliani, campaigned against the exhibition, claiming it was \"Catholic-bashing\" and an \"aggressive, vicious, disgusting attack on religion.\" In November 1999, Kennedy cancelled the exhibition and stated that the events in New York had \"obscured discussion of the artistic merit of the works of art\". He has said that it \"was the toughest decision of my professional life, so far.\"Kennedy was also repeatedly questioned on his management of a range of issues during the Australian Government's Senate Estimates process - particularly on the NGA's occupational health and safety record and concerns about the NGA's twenty-year-old air-conditioning system. The air-conditioning was finally renovated in 2003. Kennedy announced in 2002 that he would not seek extension of his contract beyond 2004, accepting a seven-year term as had his two predecessors.He became a joint Irish-Australian citizen in 2003.\n\nToledo Museum of Art\nThe Toledo Museum of Art is known for its exceptional collections of European and American paintings and sculpture, glass, antiquities, artist books, Japanese prints and netsuke. The museum offers free admission and is recognized for its historical leadership in the field of art education.  During his tenure, Kennedy has focused the museum's art education efforts on visual literacy, which he defines as \"learning to read, understand and write visual language.\"   Initiatives have included baby and toddler tours, specialized training for all staff, docents, volunteers and the launch of a website, www.vislit.org. In November 2014, the museum hosted the International Visual Literacy Association (IVLA) conference, the first Museum to do so. Kennedy has been a frequent speaker on the topic, including 2010 and 2013 TEDx talks on visual and sensory literacy.\nKennedy has expressed an interest in expanding the museum's collection of contemporary art and art by indigenous peoples. Works by Frank Stella, Sean Scully, Jaume Plensa, Ravinder Reddy and Mary Sibande have been acquired.  In addition, the museum has made major acquisitions of Old Master paintings by Frans Hals and Luca Giordano.During his tenure the Toledo Museum of Art has announced the return of several objects from its collection due to claims the objects were stolen and/or illegally exported prior being sold to the museum.  In 2011 a Meissen sweetmeat stand was returned to Germany followed by an Etruscan Kalpis or water jug to Italy (2013), an Indian sculpture of Ganesha (2014) and an astrological compendium to Germany in 2015.\n\nHood Museum of Art\nKennedy became Director of the Hood Museum of Art in July 2005. During his tenure, he implemented a series of large and small-scale exhibitions and oversaw the production of more than 20 publications to bring greater public attention to the museum's remarkable collections of the arts of America, Europe, Africa, Papua New Guinea and the Polar regions. At 70,000 objects, the Hood has one of the largest collections on any American college of university campus. The exhibition, Black Womanhood: Images, Icons, and Ideologies of the African Body, toured several US venues. Kennedy increased campus curricular use of works of art, with thousands of objects pulled from storage for classes annually. Numerous acquisitions were made with the museum's generous endowments, and he curated several exhibitions: including Wenda Gu: Forest of Stone Steles: Retranslation and Rewriting Tang Dynasty Poetry, Sean Scully: The Art of the Stripe, and Frank Stella: Irregular Polygons.\n\nPublications\nKennedy has written or edited a number of books on art, including:\n\nAlfred Chester Beatty and Ireland 1950-1968: A study in cultural politics, Glendale Press (1988), ISBN 978-0-907606-49-9\nDreams and responsibilities: The state and arts in independent Ireland, Arts Council of Ireland (1990), ISBN 978-0-906627-32-7\nJack B Yeats: Jack Butler Yeats, 1871-1957 (Lives of Irish Artists), Unipub (October 1991), ISBN 978-0-948524-24-0\nThe Anatomy Lesson: Art and Medicine (with Davis Coakley), National Gallery of Ireland (January 1992), ISBN 978-0-903162-65-4\nIreland: Art into History (with Raymond Gillespie), Roberts Rinehart Publishers (1994), ISBN 978-1-57098-005-3\nIrish Painting, Roberts Rinehart Publishers (November 1997),  ISBN 978-1-86059-059-7\nSean Scully: The Art of the Stripe, Hood Museum of Art (October 2008), ISBN 978-0-944722-34-3\nFrank Stella: Irregular Polygons, 1965-1966, Hood Museum of Art (October 2010), ISBN 978-0-944722-39-8\n\nHonors and achievements\nKennedy was awarded the Australian Centenary Medal in 2001 for service to Australian Society and its art. He is a trustee and treasurer of the Association of Art Museum Directors, a peer reviewer for the American Association of Museums and a member of the International Association of Art Critics. In 2013 he was appointed inaugural eminent professor at the University of Toledo and received an honorary doctorate from Lourdes University.

She and her sister were slaves. She spent the rest of her life in Medina and had a son, Ibrahim with Muhammad. The son died as an infant and she died almost five years later.Al-Maqrizi says that she was a native of Hebenu (Coptic: \u2ca1\u2c99\u2c81\u2c9b\u03e9\u2c81\u2c83\u2c93\u2c9b, Koin\u0113 Greek: \u1f08\u03bb\u03ac\u03b2\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03c9\u03bd \u03c0\u03cc\u03bb\u03b9\u03c2 Al\u00e1bastr\u014dn p\u00f3lis, Arabic: \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0641\u0646, romanized: al-Khafn), a village located near Antino\u00f6polis.\n\nBiography\nIn the Islamic year 6 AH (627 \u2013 628 CE), Muhammad is said to have had letters written to the great rulers of the Middle East, proclaiming the continuation of the monotheistic faith with its final messages and inviting the rulers to join. The purported texts of some of the letters are found in Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari's History of the Prophets and Kings. Tabari writes that a deputation was sent to an Egyptian governor named as al-Muqawqis. Maria was a slave who was offered as a gift of goodwill to Muhammad in reply to his envoys inviting the governor of Alexandria to Islam. Muhammad emancipated her after the birth of her son.\nTabari recounts the story of Maria's arrival from Egypt:\n\nIn this year H\u0101tib b. Abi Balta'ah came back from al-Muqawqis bringing M\u0101riyah and her sister S\u012br\u012bn, his female mule Duldul, his donkey Ya'f\u016br, and sets of garments. With the two women al-Muqawqis had sent a eunuch, and the latter stayed with them. H\u0101tib had invited them to become Muslims before he arrived with them, and M\u0101riyah and her sister did so. The Messenger of God, peace and blessings of Allah be upon Him, lodged them with Umm Sulaym bt. Milh\u0101n. M\u0101riyah was beautiful. The prophet sent her sister S\u012br\u012bn to Hass\u0101n b. Th\u0101bit and she bore him 'Abd al-Rahm\u0101n b. Hass\u0101n.\nThe death of Ibrahim caused Muhammad to weep.\n\nStatus as a wife or concubine\nMuhammad's earliest biographers, like Ibn Ishaq, Ibn Sa\u2019d, and al-Tabari, mentioned Mariyah as the Prophet\u2019s slavegirl or concubine in their sirah.Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya is another scholar and biographer of prophet Muhammad who writes a sirah called Zad al-Ma'ad where he mentioned Mariyah as a slave girl.Like Rayhana bint Zayd, there is some debate between historians and scholars as to whether Mariyah ever became Muhammad's wife or remained a concubine. An indication that she was a concubine is that when she bore her son to Muhammad, she was set free.\nIbn \u2018Abbas said: When Maria gave birth to Ibrahim the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) said, \u2018Her son has set her free.\u2019  There is also strong evidence that there was no living quarter for her in the proximity of the Prophet's Mosque. Only the wives of Muhammad had their quarters adjacent to one another in the proximity of his mosque at Medina. Maria was made to reside permanently in an orchard, some three kilometers from the mosque. Evidence that suggests she was a concubine is in the narration:\nAnas said:  The Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) had a female-slave (amat) with whom he had intercourse, but \u2018Aishah and Hafsah would not leave him alone until he said that she was forbidden for him. Then Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, revealed: \u201cO Prophet! Why do you forbid (for yourself) that which Allah has allowed to you.\u2019 until the end of the Verse.\u201d\nThe \u2018female-slave\u2019 referred to in this narration was Maria, the Copt, as specified in a hadith attributed to Umar and classified as sahih by Ibn Kathir, which names her Umm Ibrahim (the mother of Ibrahim).In a report from Ibn \u2018Abbas and \u2018Urwah b. al-Zubair concerning the same incident, Muhammad said to Hafsa:\n\nI make you witness that I my concubine (surriyyati) is now forbidden unto me.\nSome Islamic scholars point to a different Asb\u0101b al-nuz\u016bl (circumstance of revelation) for the above incident, saying it was only caused by Muhammad drinking honey, as narrated in Sahih al-Bukhari by Muhammed's wife Aisha:\nThe Prophet (\ufdfa) used to stay (for a period) in the house of Zaynab bint Jahsh (one of the wives of the Prophet ) and he used to drink honey in her house. Hafsa bint Umar and I decided that when the Prophet (\ufdfa) entered upon either of us, she would say, \"I smell in you the bad smell of Maghafir (a bad smelling raisin). Have you eaten Maghafir?\" When he entered upon one of us, she said that to him. He replied (to her), \"No, but I have drunk honey in the house of Zaynab bint Jahsh, and I will never drink it again.\"\nHowever, another narration in Sunan Abu Dawud indicates that drinking honey is a euphemism for sexual intercourse:\n\nThe Apostle of Allah (peace be upon him) was asked about a man who divorced his wife three times, and she married another who entered upon her, but divorced her before having intercourse with her, whether she was lawful for the former husband. She said: The Prophet (peace be upon him) replied: She is not lawful for the first (husband) until she tastes the honey of the other husband and he tastes her honey.\nAl-Tabari lists Maria as both one of Muhammad's wives and his slave, perhaps using \"wife\" in the sense of one whom Muhammad slept with and who mothered his child.\nMariyah the Copt was presented to the Messenger of God, given to him by al-Muqawqis, the ruler of Alexandria, and she gave birth to the Messenger of God\u2019s son Ibrahim. These were the Messenger of God's wifes.\nThe Prophet admired Umm Ibrahim [\"Mother of Ibrahim,\" Mariyah\u2019s title], who was fair-skinned and beautiful. He lodged her in al-\u2018Aliyah, at the property nowadays called of Umm Ibrahim. He used to visit her there and ordered her to veil herself, [but] he had intercourse with her by virtue of her being his property...\nOne hadith attributed to Mus\u2018ab b. \u2018Abdullah al-Zubairi states that the two were married, though another rendering of the hadith by Mus\u2018ab's nephew Zubair b. al-Bakkar makes no mention of marriage.\n\nSee also\nAisha bint Abu Bakr\nList of non-Arab Sahaba\n\nNotes\nPassage 4:\nIbrahim ibn Muhammad Al ash-Sheikh\nIbrahim ibn Muhammad Al ash-Sheikh  was a leading Salafi scholar in Saudi Arabia and minister of justice between 1975 and 1990.\n\nBackground\nIbrahim ibn Muhammad Al ash-Sheikh was born into the noted family of Saudi religious scholars, the Al ash-Sheikh, descendants of Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab, the influential Muslim scholar. He was the eldest son of Muhammad ibn Ibrahim Al ash-Sheikh, Grand Mufti of Saudi Arabia until 1969.\n\nCareer\nIbrahim ibn Muhammad was one of the most influential religious leaders in the early 1970s. He maintained a close relationship with King Faisal, with whom he met on a weekly basis. He believed that Saudi Arabia should take a leading role in the Arab world and pushed for Saudi involvement in war with Israel.Between 1975 and 1990, he served as minister of justice.\n\nFamily\nHis brother Abdullah ibn Muhammad Al ash-Sheikh, a younger son of the late Grand Mufti, also served as minister of justice, from 1993 to 2009. His grandson Turki is a lawyer practicing in London and Riyadh.\nPassage 5:\nAbdullah ibn Muhammad\n\u02bfAbd All\u0101h ibn Mu\u1e25ammad (Arabic: \u0639\u064e\u0628\u0652\u062f \u0671\u0644\u0644\u064e\u0651\u0670\u0647 \u0671\u0628\u0652\u0646 \u0645\u064f\u062d\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0651\u062f) also known as al-\u1e6c\u0101hir (lit.\u2009'the pure') and al-\u1e6cayyib (lit.\u2009'the good') was one of the sons of Muhammad and Khadija. He died in childhood.\nHis full name was Abd Allah ibn Muhammad ibn Abd Allah ibn Shaiba. His father became a successful merchant and was involved in trade. Due to his upright character Muhammad acquired the nickname \"al-Amin\" (Arabic: \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0645\u064a\u0646), meaning \"faithful, trustworthy\" and \"al-Sadiq\" meaning \"truthful\" and was sought out as an impartial arbitrator. His reputation attracted a proposal in 595 from Khadija, a successful businesswoman. Muhammad consented to the marriage, which by all accounts was a happy one. After the marriage was consummated, his elder brother al-Qasim was born. Qasim was the eldest son of Muhammad and Khadija. After Qasim, his four sisters were born. Abd Allah was born around 611. He was the youngest child of Muhammad and Khadija.\nMuhammad gave him the name of his father. Abd Allah died at 4 in 615 CE.\n\nSiblings\n\nQasim ibn Muhammad\nZainab bint Muhammad\nRuqayya bint Muhammad\nUmm Kulthum bint Muhammad\nFatima bint Muhammad\nIbrahim ibn Muhammad\nPassage 6:\nIbrahim ibn Muhammad\nIbr\u0101h\u012bm ibn Mu\u1e25ammad (Arabic: \u0625\u0650\u0628\u0652\u0631\u064e\u0627\u0647\u0650\u064a\u0645 \u0671\u0628\u0652\u0646 \u0645\u064f\u062d\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0651\u062f), was the son of the Islamic prophet Muhammad and Maria al-Qibtiyya. He died at the age of 2.\n\nEclipse occurrence\nIn his book \"Al-Bid\u0101ya wa-n-Nih\u0101ya\" Ibn Kathir mentions that Ibrahim died on Thursday 10 Rabi' al-Awwal 10 AH, and on the same day right after his death, an eclipse of the sun occurred, so people at the moment started talking that Allah is showing his condolences to his prophet by eclipsing the Sun. Muhammad, not wanting his companions to fall into Fitna by ascribing divinities to him or his son, stood at the mosque and said:  \"The sun and the moon do not eclipse because of the death or life (i.e. birth) of someone. When you see the eclipse pray and invoke Allah.\"\n\nIllness and death\nMuhammad's wife, and the mother of believers, Ibrahim's mother was an Egyptian woman who came from Byzantine official to Muhammad in 628. According to Ibn Kathir, quoting Ibn Sa'd, he was born in the last month of the year 8 AH, equivalent of 630 CE. Muslim scholars such as Muslim ibn al-Hajjaj and Al-Nasa'i mention that Al-Waqidi is not reliable and is not trustworthy to be quoted. The child was named after Abraham (or Ibrahim in Arabic) the Biblical prophet revered in Jewish, Christian and Muslim traditions. Ibrahim was placed in the care of a nurse called Umm Sayf, wife of Abu Sayf, the blacksmith, in the tradition of the Arabs of the time, to whom Muhammad gave some goats to complement her milk supply. When he fell ill he was moved to a date orchard near the residence of his mother, under the care of her and her sister Sirin. When it was clear that he would not likely survive, Muhammad was informed. His reaction to the news is reported as:\n\nHe was so shocked at the news that he felt his knees could no longer carry him, and asked `Abd al Rahman ibn `Awf to give him his hand to lean upon. He proceeded immediately to the orchard and arrived in time to bid farewell to an infant dying in his mother's lap. Prophet Muhammad took the child and laid him in his own lap while shaking his hand. His heart was torn apart by the new tragedy, and his face mirrored his inner pain. Choking with sorrow, he said to his son, \"O Ibrahim, against the judgement of God, we cannot avail you a thing,\" and then fell silent. Tears flowed from his eyes. The child lapsed gradually, and his mother and aunt watched and cried incessantly, and the Prophet never ordered them to stop. As Ibrahim surrendered to death, Prophet Muhammad's hope which had consoled him for a brief while completely crumbled. With tears in his eyes he talked once more to the dead child: \"O Ibrahim, were the truth not certain that the last of us will join the first, we would have mourned you even more than we do now.\" A moment later he said: \"The eyes send their tears and the heart is saddened, but we do not say anything except that which pleases our Lord. Indeed, O Ibrahim, we are bereaved by your departure from us.\"\n\nBurial\nMuhammad is also reported as having informed Maria and Sirin that Ibrahim would have his own nurse in Paradise. Different accounts relate that the ghusl for Ibrahim was performed by either Umm Burdah, or al-Fadl ibn \u02bfAbbas, in preparation for burial. Thereafter, he was carried to the cemetery upon a little bier by Muhammad, his uncle al-\u02bfAbbas, and others. Here, after a funeral prayer led by Muhammad, he was interred. Muhammad then filled the grave with sand, sprinkled some water upon it, and placed a landmark on it, saying that \"Tombstones do neither good nor ill, but they help appease the living.

She and her sister were slaves. She spent the rest of her life in Medina and had a son, Ibrahim with Muhammad. The son died as an infant and she died almost five years later.Al-Maqrizi says that she was a native of Hebenu (Coptic: \u2ca1\u2c99\u2c81\u2c9b\u03e9\u2c81\u2c83\u2c93\u2c9b, Koin\u0113 Greek: \u1f08\u03bb\u03ac\u03b2\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03c9\u03bd \u03c0\u03cc\u03bb\u03b9\u03c2 Al\u00e1bastr\u014dn p\u00f3lis, Arabic: \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0641\u0646, romanized: al-Khafn), a village located near Antino\u00f6polis.\n\nBiography\nIn the Islamic year 6 AH (627 \u2013 628 CE), Muhammad is said to have had letters written to the great rulers of the Middle East, proclaiming the continuation of the monotheistic faith with its final messages and inviting the rulers to join. The purported texts of some of the letters are found in Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari's History of the Prophets and Kings. Tabari writes that a deputation was sent to an Egyptian governor named as al-Muqawqis. Maria was a slave who was offered as a gift of goodwill to Muhammad in reply to his envoys inviting the governor of Alexandria to Islam. Muhammad emancipated her after the birth of her son.\nTabari recounts the story of Maria's arrival from Egypt:\n\nIn this year H\u0101tib b. Abi Balta'ah came back from al-Muqawqis bringing M\u0101riyah and her sister S\u012br\u012bn, his female mule Duldul, his donkey Ya'f\u016br, and sets of garments. With the two women al-Muqawqis had sent a eunuch, and the latter stayed with them. H\u0101tib had invited them to become Muslims before he arrived with them, and M\u0101riyah and her sister did so. The Messenger of God, peace and blessings of Allah be upon Him, lodged them with Umm Sulaym bt. Milh\u0101n. M\u0101riyah was beautiful. The prophet sent her sister S\u012br\u012bn to Hass\u0101n b. Th\u0101bit and she bore him 'Abd al-Rahm\u0101n b. Hass\u0101n.\nThe death of Ibrahim caused Muhammad to weep.\n\nStatus as a wife or concubine\nMuhammad's earliest biographers, like Ibn Ishaq, Ibn Sa\u2019d, and al-Tabari, mentioned Mariyah as the Prophet\u2019s slavegirl or concubine in their sirah.Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya is another scholar and biographer of prophet Muhammad who writes a sirah called Zad al-Ma'ad where he mentioned Mariyah as a slave girl.Like Rayhana bint Zayd, there is some debate between historians and scholars as to whether Mariyah ever became Muhammad's wife or remained a concubine. An indication that she was a concubine is that when she bore her son to Muhammad, she was set free.\nIbn \u2018Abbas said: When Maria gave birth to Ibrahim the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) said, \u2018Her son has set her free.\u2019  There is also strong evidence that there was no living quarter for her in the proximity of the Prophet's Mosque. Only the wives of Muhammad had their quarters adjacent to one another in the proximity of his mosque at Medina. Maria was made to reside permanently in an orchard, some three kilometers from the mosque. Evidence that suggests she was a concubine is in the narration:\nAnas said:  The Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) had a female-slave (amat) with whom he had intercourse, but \u2018Aishah and Hafsah would not leave him alone until he said that she was forbidden for him. Then Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, revealed: \u201cO Prophet! Why do you forbid (for yourself) that which Allah has allowed to you.\u2019 until the end of the Verse.\u201d\nThe \u2018female-slave\u2019 referred to in this narration was Maria, the Copt, as specified in a hadith attributed to Umar and classified as sahih by Ibn Kathir, which names her Umm Ibrahim (the mother of Ibrahim).In a report from Ibn \u2018Abbas and \u2018Urwah b. al-Zubair concerning the same incident, Muhammad said to Hafsa:\n\nI make you witness that I my concubine (surriyyati) is now forbidden unto me.\nSome Islamic scholars point to a different Asb\u0101b al-nuz\u016bl (circumstance of revelation) for the above incident, saying it was only caused by Muhammad drinking honey, as narrated in Sahih al-Bukhari by Muhammed's wife Aisha:\nThe Prophet (\ufdfa) used to stay (for a period) in the house of Zaynab bint Jahsh (one of the wives of the Prophet ) and he used to drink honey in her house. Hafsa bint Umar and I decided that when the Prophet (\ufdfa) entered upon either of us, she would say, \"I smell in you the bad smell of Maghafir (a bad smelling raisin). Have you eaten Maghafir?\" When he entered upon one of us, she said that to him. He replied (to her), \"No, but I have drunk honey in the house of Zaynab bint Jahsh, and I will never drink it again.\"\nHowever, another narration in Sunan Abu Dawud indicates that drinking honey is a euphemism for sexual intercourse:\n\nThe Apostle of Allah (peace be upon him) was asked about a man who divorced his wife three times, and she married another who entered upon her, but divorced her before having intercourse with her, whether she was lawful for the former husband. She said: The Prophet (peace be upon him) replied: She is not lawful for the first (husband) until she tastes the honey of the other husband and he tastes her honey.\nAl-Tabari lists Maria as both one of Muhammad's wives and his slave, perhaps using \"wife\" in the sense of one whom Muhammad slept with and who mothered his child.\nMariyah the Copt was presented to the Messenger of God, given to him by al-Muqawqis, the ruler of Alexandria, and she gave birth to the Messenger of God\u2019s son Ibrahim. These were the Messenger of God's wifes.\nThe Prophet admired Umm Ibrahim [\"Mother of Ibrahim,\" Mariyah\u2019s title], who was fair-skinned and beautiful. He lodged her in al-\u2018Aliyah, at the property nowadays called of Umm Ibrahim. He used to visit her there and ordered her to veil herself, [but] he had intercourse with her by virtue of her being his property...\nOne hadith attributed to Mus\u2018ab b. \u2018Abdullah al-Zubairi states that the two were married, though another rendering of the hadith by Mus\u2018ab's nephew Zubair b. al-Bakkar makes no mention of marriage.\n\nSee also\nAisha bint Abu Bakr\nList of non-Arab Sahaba\n\nNotes\nPassage 4:\nIbrahim ibn Muhammad Al ash-Sheikh\nIbrahim ibn Muhammad Al ash-Sheikh  was a leading Salafi scholar in Saudi Arabia and minister of justice between 1975 and 1990.\n\nBackground\nIbrahim ibn Muhammad Al ash-Sheikh was born into the noted family of Saudi religious scholars, the Al ash-Sheikh, descendants of Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab, the influential Muslim scholar. He was the eldest son of Muhammad ibn Ibrahim Al ash-Sheikh, Grand Mufti of Saudi Arabia until 1969.\n\nCareer\nIbrahim ibn Muhammad was one of the most influential religious leaders in the early 1970s. He maintained a close relationship with King Faisal, with whom he met on a weekly basis. He believed that Saudi Arabia should take a leading role in the Arab world and pushed for Saudi involvement in war with Israel.Between 1975 and 1990, he served as minister of justice.\n\nFamily\nHis brother Abdullah ibn Muhammad Al ash-Sheikh, a younger son of the late Grand Mufti, also served as minister of justice, from 1993 to 2009. His grandson Turki is a lawyer practicing in London and Riyadh.\nPassage 5:\nAbdullah ibn Muhammad\n\u02bfAbd All\u0101h ibn Mu\u1e25ammad (Arabic: \u0639\u064e\u0628\u0652\u062f \u0671\u0644\u0644\u064e\u0651\u0670\u0647 \u0671\u0628\u0652\u0646 \u0645\u064f\u062d\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0651\u062f) also known as al-\u1e6c\u0101hir (lit.\u2009'the pure') and al-\u1e6cayyib (lit.\u2009'the good') was one of the sons of Muhammad and Khadija. He died in childhood.\nHis full name was Abd Allah ibn Muhammad ibn Abd Allah ibn Shaiba. His father became a successful merchant and was involved in trade. Due to his upright character Muhammad acquired the nickname \"al-Amin\" (Arabic: \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0645\u064a\u0646), meaning \"faithful, trustworthy\" and \"al-Sadiq\" meaning \"truthful\" and was sought out as an impartial arbitrator. His reputation attracted a proposal in 595 from Khadija, a successful businesswoman. Muhammad consented to the marriage, which by all accounts was a happy one. After the marriage was consummated, his elder brother al-Qasim was born. Qasim was the eldest son of Muhammad and Khadija. After Qasim, his four sisters were born. Abd Allah was born around 611. He was the youngest child of Muhammad and Khadija.\nMuhammad gave him the name of his father. Abd Allah died at 4 in 615 CE.\n\nSiblings\n\nQasim ibn Muhammad\nZainab bint Muhammad\nRuqayya bint Muhammad\nUmm Kulthum bint Muhammad\nFatima bint Muhammad\nIbrahim ibn Muhammad\nPassage 6:\nIbrahim ibn Muhammad\nIbr\u0101h\u012bm ibn Mu\u1e25ammad (Arabic: \u0625\u0650\u0628\u0652\u0631\u064e\u0627\u0647\u0650\u064a\u0645 \u0671\u0628\u0652\u0646 \u0645\u064f\u062d\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0651\u062f), was the son of the Islamic prophet Muhammad and Maria al-Qibtiyya. He died at the age of 2.\n\nEclipse occurrence\nIn his book \"Al-Bid\u0101ya wa-n-Nih\u0101ya\" Ibn Kathir mentions that Ibrahim died on Thursday 10 Rabi' al-Awwal 10 AH, and on the same day right after his death, an eclipse of the sun occurred, so people at the moment started talking that Allah is showing his condolences to his prophet by eclipsing the Sun. Muhammad, not wanting his companions to fall into Fitna by ascribing divinities to him or his son, stood at the mosque and said:  \"The sun and the moon do not eclipse because of the death or life (i.e. birth) of someone. When you see the eclipse pray and invoke Allah.\"\n\nIllness and death\nMuhammad's wife, and the mother of believers, Ibrahim's mother was an Egyptian woman who came from Byzantine official to Muhammad in 628. According to Ibn Kathir, quoting Ibn Sa'd, he was born in the last month of the year 8 AH, equivalent of 630 CE. Muslim scholars such as Muslim ibn al-Hajjaj and Al-Nasa'i mention that Al-Waqidi is not reliable and is not trustworthy to be quoted. The child was named after Abraham (or Ibrahim in Arabic) the Biblical prophet revered in Jewish, Christian and Muslim traditions. Ibrahim was placed in the care of a nurse called Umm Sayf, wife of Abu Sayf, the blacksmith, in the tradition of the Arabs of the time, to whom Muhammad gave some goats to complement her milk supply. When he fell ill he was moved to a date orchard near the residence of his mother, under the care of her and her sister Sirin. When it was clear that he would not likely survive, Muhammad was informed. His reaction to the news is reported as:\n\nHe was so shocked at the news that he felt his knees could no longer carry him, and asked `Abd al Rahman ibn `Awf to give him his hand to lean upon. He proceeded immediately to the orchard and arrived in time to bid farewell to an infant dying in his mother's lap. Prophet Muhammad took the child and laid him in his own lap while shaking his hand. His heart was torn apart by the new tragedy, and his face mirrored his inner pain. Choking with sorrow, he said to his son, \"O Ibrahim, against the judgement of God, we cannot avail you a thing,\" and then fell silent. Tears flowed from his eyes. The child lapsed gradually, and his mother and aunt watched and cried incessantly, and the Prophet never ordered them to stop. As Ibrahim surrendered to death, Prophet Muhammad's hope which had consoled him for a brief while completely crumbled. With tears in his eyes he talked once more to the dead child: \"O Ibrahim, were the truth not certain that the last of us will join the first, we would have mourned you even more than we do now.\" A moment later he said: \"The eyes send their tears and the heart is saddened, but we do not say anything except that which pleases our Lord. Indeed, O Ibrahim, we are bereaved by your departure from us.\"\n\nBurial\nMuhammad is also reported as having informed Maria and Sirin that Ibrahim would have his own nurse in Paradise. Different accounts relate that the ghusl for Ibrahim was performed by either Umm Burdah, or al-Fadl ibn \u02bfAbbas, in preparation for burial. Thereafter, he was carried to the cemetery upon a little bier by Muhammad, his uncle al-\u02bfAbbas, and others. Here, after a funeral prayer led by Muhammad, he was interred. Muhammad then filled the grave with sand, sprinkled some water upon it, and placed a landmark on it, saying that \"Tombstones do neither good nor ill, but they help appease the living. Anything that man does, God wishes him to do well.\"\n\nSiblings\nQasim ibn Muhammad\nAbd Allah ibn Muhammad\nZainab bint Muhammad\nRuqayya bint Muhammad\nUmm Kulthum bint Muhammad\nFatimah al-Zahra bint Muhammad\n\nSee also\nIslam and children\nPassage 7:\nIbrahim ibn al-Husayn (Ibn al-Walid)\nIbrahim ibn al-Husayn ibn Ali ibn Muhammad ibn al-Walid (Arabic: \u0625\u0628\u0631\u0627\u0647\u064a\u0645 \u0628\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0633\u064a\u0646 \u0628\u0646 \u0639\u0644\u064a \u0628\u0646 \u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0628\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0648\u0644\u064a\u062f, romanized: Ibr\u0101h\u012bm ibn al-\u1e24usayn ibn \u02bfAl\u012b ibn Mu\u1e25ammad ibn al-Wal\u012bd) was the eleventh Tayyibi Isma'ili D\u0101\u02bf\u012b al-Mu\u1e6dlaq in Yemen, from 1287 to his death in 1328.\n\nLife\nIbrahim was a member of the Banu al-Walid al-Anf family, that dominated the office of D\u0101\u02bf\u012b al-Mu\u1e6dlaq almost continuously in the 13th to early 16th centuries.

It was Fassbinder's last film, released shortly after his death at the age of 37.\n\nPlot\nThe plot centers on the handsome Belgian sailor Georges Querelle, who is also a thief and murderer. When his ship, Le Vengeur, arrives in Brest, he visits the Feria, a bar and brothel for sailors run by the Madame Lysiane, whose lover, Robert, is Querelle's brother. Querelle has a love/hate relationship with his brother: when they meet at La Feria, they embrace, but also punch one another slowly and repeatedly in the belly. Lysiane's husband Nono works behind the bar and also manages La Feria's underhanded affairs with the assistance of his friend, the corrupt police captain Mario.\nQuerelle makes a deal to sell opium to Nono. During the execution of the deal, he murders his accomplice Vic by slitting his throat.  After delivering the drugs, Querelle announces that he wants to sleep with Lysiane.  He knows that this means he will have to throw dice with Nono, who has the privilege of playing a game of chance with all of her prospective lovers. If Nono loses, the suitor is allowed to proceed with his affair. If the suitor loses, however, he must submit to anal sex with Nono first, according to Nono's maxim that \"That way, I can say my wife only sleeps with arseholes.\" Querelle deliberately loses the game, allowing himself to be sodomized by Nono. When Nono gloats about Querelle's \"loss\" to Robert, who won his dice game, the brothers end up in a violent fight.  Later, Querelle becomes Lysiane's lover, and also has sex with Mario.\nLuckily for Querelle, a builder, Gil, murders his work mate Theo, who had been harassing and sexually assaulting him.  Gil hides from the police in an abandoned prison, and Roger, who is in love with Gil, establishes contact between Querelle and Gil in the hopes that Querelle can help Gil flee. Querelle falls in love with Gil, who closely resembles his brother.  Gil returns his affections, but Querelle betrays Gil by tipping off the police. Querelle cleverly arranged it so that the murder of Vic is also blamed on Gil.\nQuerelle's superior, Lieutenant Seblon, is in love with Querelle, and constantly tries to prove his manliness to him. Seblon is aware that Querelle murdered Vic, but chooses to protect him.  Later, Seblon reveals his love and concern to a drunken Querelle, and they kiss and embrace before returning to Le Vengeur.\n\nCast\nBrad Davis as Querelle\nFranco Nero as Lieutenant Seblon\nJeanne Moreau as Lysiane\nLaurent Malet as Roger Bataille\nHanno P\u00f6schl as Robert / Gil\nG\u00fcnther Kaufmann as Nono\nBurkhard Driest as Mario\nRoger Fritz as Marcellin\nDieter Schidor as Vic Rivette\nNatja Brunckhorst as Paulette\nWerner Asam as Worker\nAxel Bauer as Worker\nNeil Bell as Theo\nRobert van Ackeren as Drunken legionnaire\nWolf Gremm as Drunken legionnaire\nFrank Ripploh as Drunken legionnaire\n\nProduction\nAccording to Genet's biographer Edmund White, Querelle was originally going to be made by Werner Schroeter, with a scenario by Burkhard Driest, and produced by Dieter Schidor. However, Schidor could not find the money to finance a film by Schroeter, and therefore turned to other directors, including John Schlesinger and Sam Peckinpah, before finally settling on Fassbinder. Driest wrote a radically different script for Fassbinder, who then \"took the linear narrative and jumbled it up\". White quotes Schidor as saying \"Fassbinder did something totally different, he took the words of Genet and tried to meditate on something other than the story. The story became totally unimportant for him. He also said publicly that the story was a sort of third-rate police story that wouldn't be worth making a movie about without putting a particular moral impact into it\".Schroeter had wanted to make a black and white film with amateur actors and location shots, but Fassbinder instead shot it with professional actors in a lurid, expressionist color, and on sets in the studio. Edmund White comments that the result is a film in which, \"Everything is bathed in an artificial light and the architectural elements are all symbolic.\"\n\nSoundtrack\nJeanne Moreau \u2013 \"Each Man Kills the Things He Loves\" (music by Peer Raben, lyrics from Oscar Wilde's poem \"The Ballad of Reading Gaol\")\n\"Young and Joyful Bandit\" (Music by Peer Raben, lyrics by Jeanne Moreau)Both songs were nominated to the 1984 Razzie Awards for \"Worst Original Song\".\n\nRelease\nQuerelle sold more than 100,000 tickets in the first three weeks after its release in Paris, the first time that a film with a gay theme had achieved such success. On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, which categorizes reviews as positive or negative only, the film has an approval rating of 57% calculated based on 14 critics comments. By comparison, with the same opinions being calculated using a weighted arithmetic mean, the rating is 6.10/10. Writing for The New York Times critic Vincent Canby noted that Querelle was \"a mess...a detour that leads to a dead end.\"\nPenny Ashbrook calls Querelle Fassbinder's \"perfect epitaph: an intensely personal statement that is the most uncompromising portrayal of gay male sensibility to come from a major filmmaker.\" Edmund White considers Querelle the only film based on Genet's book that works, calling it \"visually as artificial and menacing as Genet's prose.\" Genet, in discussion with Schidor, said that he had not seen the film, commenting \"You can't smoke at the movies.\"\nPassage 10:\nIronmaster (film)\nIronmaster (Italian: La guerra del ferro: Ironmaster) is a 1983 film directed by Umberto Lenzi.\n\nProduction\nIronmaster was filmed on location at Custer State Park in South Dakota with interiors shot at RPA-Elios Studios in Rome.\n\nRelease\nIronmaster was released in Italy on 10 March 1983. The film was released on Blu-ray on 23 January 2017 in North America by Code Red and on 10 April 2017 in the United Kingdom by 88 Films.\n\nReception\nAccording to Michael Klossner, author of Prehistoric Humans in Film and Television, while Ironmaster received \"few and very bad notices [and is] simple, only modestly ambitious and has its share of flaws \u2026 it's hard not to like a film which shows intelligent, articulate prehistoric people making discoveries, facing moral issues and showing capacity for great evil and finally for good.\" Hal Erickson wrote in AllMovie that \"Seldom has there been a more predictable 98 minutes' worth of Sword and Sorcery, but that doesn't mean it isn't enjoyable.\"\n\nAnswer the question based on the given passages.

It was Fassbinder's last film, released shortly after his death at the age of 37.\n\nPlot\nThe plot centers on the handsome Belgian sailor Georges Querelle, who is also a thief and murderer. When his ship, Le Vengeur, arrives in Brest, he visits the Feria, a bar and brothel for sailors run by the Madame Lysiane, whose lover, Robert, is Querelle's brother. Querelle has a love/hate relationship with his brother: when they meet at La Feria, they embrace, but also punch one another slowly and repeatedly in the belly. Lysiane's husband Nono works behind the bar and also manages La Feria's underhanded affairs with the assistance of his friend, the corrupt police captain Mario.\nQuerelle makes a deal to sell opium to Nono. During the execution of the deal, he murders his accomplice Vic by slitting his throat.  After delivering the drugs, Querelle announces that he wants to sleep with Lysiane.  He knows that this means he will have to throw dice with Nono, who has the privilege of playing a game of chance with all of her prospective lovers. If Nono loses, the suitor is allowed to proceed with his affair. If the suitor loses, however, he must submit to anal sex with Nono first, according to Nono's maxim that \"That way, I can say my wife only sleeps with arseholes.\" Querelle deliberately loses the game, allowing himself to be sodomized by Nono. When Nono gloats about Querelle's \"loss\" to Robert, who won his dice game, the brothers end up in a violent fight.  Later, Querelle becomes Lysiane's lover, and also has sex with Mario.\nLuckily for Querelle, a builder, Gil, murders his work mate Theo, who had been harassing and sexually assaulting him.  Gil hides from the police in an abandoned prison, and Roger, who is in love with Gil, establishes contact between Querelle and Gil in the hopes that Querelle can help Gil flee. Querelle falls in love with Gil, who closely resembles his brother.  Gil returns his affections, but Querelle betrays Gil by tipping off the police. Querelle cleverly arranged it so that the murder of Vic is also blamed on Gil.\nQuerelle's superior, Lieutenant Seblon, is in love with Querelle, and constantly tries to prove his manliness to him. Seblon is aware that Querelle murdered Vic, but chooses to protect him.  Later, Seblon reveals his love and concern to a drunken Querelle, and they kiss and embrace before returning to Le Vengeur.\n\nCast\nBrad Davis as Querelle\nFranco Nero as Lieutenant Seblon\nJeanne Moreau as Lysiane\nLaurent Malet as Roger Bataille\nHanno P\u00f6schl as Robert / Gil\nG\u00fcnther Kaufmann as Nono\nBurkhard Driest as Mario\nRoger Fritz as Marcellin\nDieter Schidor as Vic Rivette\nNatja Brunckhorst as Paulette\nWerner Asam as Worker\nAxel Bauer as Worker\nNeil Bell as Theo\nRobert van Ackeren as Drunken legionnaire\nWolf Gremm as Drunken legionnaire\nFrank Ripploh as Drunken legionnaire\n\nProduction\nAccording to Genet's biographer Edmund White, Querelle was originally going to be made by Werner Schroeter, with a scenario by Burkhard Driest, and produced by Dieter Schidor. However, Schidor could not find the money to finance a film by Schroeter, and therefore turned to other directors, including John Schlesinger and Sam Peckinpah, before finally settling on Fassbinder. Driest wrote a radically different script for Fassbinder, who then \"took the linear narrative and jumbled it up\". White quotes Schidor as saying \"Fassbinder did something totally different, he took the words of Genet and tried to meditate on something other than the story. The story became totally unimportant for him. He also said publicly that the story was a sort of third-rate police story that wouldn't be worth making a movie about without putting a particular moral impact into it\".Schroeter had wanted to make a black and white film with amateur actors and location shots, but Fassbinder instead shot it with professional actors in a lurid, expressionist color, and on sets in the studio. Edmund White comments that the result is a film in which, \"Everything is bathed in an artificial light and the architectural elements are all symbolic.\"\n\nSoundtrack\nJeanne Moreau \u2013 \"Each Man Kills the Things He Loves\" (music by Peer Raben, lyrics from Oscar Wilde's poem \"The Ballad of Reading Gaol\")\n\"Young and Joyful Bandit\" (Music by Peer Raben, lyrics by Jeanne Moreau)Both songs were nominated to the 1984 Razzie Awards for \"Worst Original Song\".\n\nRelease\nQuerelle sold more than 100,000 tickets in the first three weeks after its release in Paris, the first time that a film with a gay theme had achieved such success. On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, which categorizes reviews as positive or negative only, the film has an approval rating of 57% calculated based on 14 critics comments. By comparison, with the same opinions being calculated using a weighted arithmetic mean, the rating is 6.10/10. Writing for The New York Times critic Vincent Canby noted that Querelle was \"a mess...a detour that leads to a dead end.\"\nPenny Ashbrook calls Querelle Fassbinder's \"perfect epitaph: an intensely personal statement that is the most uncompromising portrayal of gay male sensibility to come from a major filmmaker.\" Edmund White considers Querelle the only film based on Genet's book that works, calling it \"visually as artificial and menacing as Genet's prose.\" Genet, in discussion with Schidor, said that he had not seen the film, commenting \"You can't smoke at the movies.\"\nPassage 10:\nIronmaster (film)\nIronmaster (Italian: La guerra del ferro: Ironmaster) is a 1983 film directed by Umberto Lenzi.\n\nProduction\nIronmaster was filmed on location at Custer State Park in South Dakota with interiors shot at RPA-Elios Studios in Rome.\n\nRelease\nIronmaster was released in Italy on 10 March 1983. The film was released on Blu-ray on 23 January 2017 in North America by Code Red and on 10 April 2017 in the United Kingdom by 88 Films.\n\nReception\nAccording to Michael Klossner, author of Prehistoric Humans in Film and Television, while Ironmaster received \"few and very bad notices [and is] simple, only modestly ambitious and has its share of flaws \u2026 it's hard not to like a film which shows intelligent, articulate prehistoric people making discoveries, facing moral issues and showing capacity for great evil and finally for good.\" Hal Erickson wrote in AllMovie that \"Seldom has there been a more predictable 98 minutes' worth of Sword and Sorcery, but that doesn't mean it isn't enjoyable.\"", "answers": ["Mickey'S Tent Show"], "length": 2858, "dataset": "2wikimqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "4adca5ba1654b740d1e25c6e73d45aa2f3621537bed9086b", "pred": " Mickey'S Tent Show.

In the following game, the last away match of the season, he took 10 Hampshire wickets for 150 runs in the match at Bournemouth. In the 1948 season as a whole, he took 91 wickets at an average of 28.07. As a tail-end left-handed batsman, he managed just 93 runs in the season at an average of 4.22.The emergence of Tony Lock as a slow left-arm bowler in 1949 brought a stuttering end of McMahon's Surrey career. Though he played in 12 first-class matches in the 1949 season, McMahon took only 19 wickets; a similar number of matches in 1950 brought 34 wickets. In 1951, he played just seven times and in 1952 only three times. In 1953, Lock split the first finger of his left hand, and played in only 11 of Surrey's County Championship matches; McMahon played as his deputy in 14 Championship matches, though a measure of their comparative merits was that Lock's 11 games produced 67 wickets at 12.38 runs apiece, while McMahon's 14 games brought him 45 wickets at the, for him, low average of 21.53. At the end of the 1953 season, McMahon was allowed to leave Surrey to join Somerset, then languishing at the foot of the County Championship and recruiting widely from other counties and other countries.\n\nSomerset cricketer\nSomerset's slow bowling in 1954 was in the hands of leg-spinner Johnny Lawrence, with support from the off-spin of Jim Hilton while promising off-spinner Brian Langford was on national service. McMahon filled a vacancy for a left-arm orthodox spinner that had been there since the retirement of Horace Hazell at the end of the 1952 season; Hazell's apparent successor, Roy Smith, had failed to realise his promise as a bowler in 1953, though his batting had advanced significantly.\nMcMahon instantly became a first-team regular and played in almost every match during his four years with the county, not missing a single Championship game until he was controversially dropped from the side in August 1957, after which he did not play in the Championship again.In the 1954 season, McMahon, alongside fellow newcomer Hilton, was something of a disappointment, according to Wisden: \"The new spin bowlers, McMahon and Hilton, did not attain to the best standards of their craft in a wet summer, yet, like the rest of the attack, they would have fared better with reasonable support in the field and from their own batsmen,\" it said. McMahon took 85 wickets at an average of 27.47 (Hilton took only 42 at a higher average). His best match was against Essex at Weston-super-Mare where he took six for 96 in the first innings and five for 45 in the second to finish with match figures of 11 for 141, which were the best of his career. He was awarded his county cap in the 1954 season, but Somerset remained at the bottom of the table.\nThe figures for the 1955 were similar: McMahon this time took 75 wickets at 28.77 apiece. There was a small improvement in his batting and the arrival of Bryan Lobb elevated McMahon to No 10 in the batting order for most of the season, and he responded with 262 runs and an average of 9.03. This included his highest-ever score, 24, made in the match against Sussex at Frome. A week later in Somerset's next match, he equalled his best-ever bowling performance, taking eight Kent wickets for 46 runs in the first innings of a match at Yeovil through what Wisden called \"clever variation of flight and spin\". These matches brought two victories for Somerset, but there were only two others in the 1955 season and the side finished at the bottom of the Championship for the fourth season running.At the end of the 1955 season, Lawrence retired and McMahon became Somerset's senior spin bowler for the 1956 season, with Langford returning from National Service as the main support. McMahon responded with his most successful season so far, taking 103 wickets at an average of 25.57, the only season in his career in which he exceeded 100 wickets. The bowling average improved still further in 1957 to 23.10 when McMahon took 86 wickets. But his season came to an abrupt end in mid-August 1957 when, after 108 consecutive Championship matches, he was dropped from the first team during the Weston-super-Mare festival. Though he played some games for the second eleven later in August, he regained his place in the first team for only a single end-of-season friendly match, and he was told that his services were not required for the future, a decision, said Wisden, that \"proved highly controversial\".\n\nSacked by Somerset\nThe reason behind McMahon's sacking did not become public knowledge for many years. In its obituary of him in 2002, McMahon was described by Wisden as \"a man who embraced the antipodean virtues of candour and conviviality\". It went on: \"Legend tells of a night at the Flying Horse Inn in Nottingham when he beheaded the gladioli with an ornamental sword, crying: 'When Mac drinks, everybody drinks!'\" The obituary recounts a further escapade in second eleven match at Midsomer Norton where a curfew imposed on the team was circumvented by \"a POW-type loop\" organised by McMahon, \"with his team-mates escaping through a ground-storey window and then presenting themselves again\". As the only Somerset second eleven match that McMahon played in at Midsomer Norton was right at the end of the 1957 season, this may have been the final straw. But in any case there had been \"an embarrassing episode at Swansea's Grand Hotel\" earlier in the season, also involving Jim Hilton, who was also dismissed at the end of the season. Team-mates and club members petitioned for McMahon to be reinstated, but the county club was not to be moved.\nAfter a period in Lancashire League cricket with Milnrow Cricket Club, McMahon moved back to London where he did office work, later contributing some articles to cricket magazines.\n\n\n== Notes and references ==\nPassage 9:\nAvital Tamir\nAvital Tamir (Hebrew: \u05d0\u05d1\u05d9\u05d8\u05dc \u05ea\u05de\u05d9\u05e8) is an Israeli musician best known for his work as the lead singer for metal band Betzefer and for his experimental pop trio On Shoulders of Giants.

In 2005, the band released its first full-length album Down Low.\nTamir was the vocalist for the band since its formation and appeared on all of the band's releases, until his departure in 2016. He was replaced by Aharon Ragoza.\n\nNail Within (2003, 2007)\nIn 2003, after Nail Within vocalist Yishay Swearts left, guitarist Matan Cohen brought his Betzefer bandmates Avital Tamir (on vocals) and Rotem Inbar (on bass) to play with the band. After few rehearsals the idea fell through and the band disbanded. Although, before those events, Tamir did guest on some live shows of Nail Within. \n\nIn 2007, before reuniting the whole line-up, Cohen brought Tamir once again to rehearse with the band.

He went to England at the end of World War II as a member of the Royal Air Force, and settled in Kidderminster in Worcestershire in 1947, where he worked as a civilian lorry driver for the RAF. He began playing for Kidderminster Cricket Club in the Birmingham League, and at the start of the 1952 season, opening the bowling for the club's senior team, he had figures of 7 for 9 and 7 for 37.Worcestershire invited him to play for them, and he made his first-class debut against Sussex in July 1952. He took five wickets in the match (his maiden victim being Ken Suttle) and then held on for 4 not out with Peter Richardson (20 not out) to add the 12 runs needed for a one-wicket victory after his county had collapsed from 192 for 2 to 238 for 9. A week later he claimed four wickets against Warwickshire, then a few days later still he managed 6 for 52 (five of his victims bowled) in what was otherwise a disastrous innings defeat to Derbyshire. In the last match of the season he took a career-best 6 for 51 against Glamorgan; he and Reg Perks (4 for 59) bowled unchanged throughout the first innings. Worcestershire won the game and Lobban finished the season with 23 wickets at 23.69.He took 23 wickets again in 1953, but at a considerably worse average of 34.43, and had only two really successful games: against Oxford University in June, when he took 5 for 70, and then against Sussex in July. On this occasion Lobban claimed eight wickets, his most in a match, including 6 for 103 in the first innings. He also made his highest score with the bat, 18, but Sussex won by five wickets.In 1954 Lobban made only two first-class appearances, and managed only the single wicket of Gloucestershire tail-ender Bomber Wells. In his final game, against Warwickshire at Dudley, his nine first-innings overs cost 51. He bowled just two overs in the second innings as Warwickshire completed an easy ten-wicket win. Lobban played one more Second XI game, against Glamorgan II at Cardiff Arms Park; in this he picked up five wickets.\nHe was also a professional boxer and played rugby union for Kidderminster.He later moved to Canada, where he worked as a teacher in Burnaby, British Columbia.

In consecutive seasons, 1876\u201377 and 1877\u201378, playing for Canterbury, he made the highest score in the short New Zealand first-class season: 76 and 75 respectively. His 76 came in his first match for Canterbury, against Otago. He went to the wicket early on the first day with the score at 7 for 2 and put on 99 for the third wicket with Charles Corfe before he was out with the score at 106 for 3 after a \"very fine exhibition of free hitting, combined with good defence\". Canterbury were all out for 133, but went on to win the match. His 75 came in the next season's match against Otago, when he took the score from 22 for 2 to 136 for 6. The New Zealand cricket historian Tom Reese said, \"Right from the beginning he smote the bowling hip and thigh, going out of his ground to indulge in some forceful driving.\" Canterbury won again.Moore led the batting averages in the Canterbury Cricket Association in 1877\u201378 with 379 runs at an average of 34.4. Also in 1877\u201378, he was a member of the Canterbury team that inflicted the only defeat on the touring Australians.

In the first innings of his first match, against Lancashire at The Oval, he took five wickets for 81 runs.In his first full season, 1948, he was Surrey's leading wicket-taker and in the last home game of the season he was awarded his county cap \u2013 he celebrated by taking eight Northamptonshire wickets for 46 runs at The Oval, six of them coming in the space of 6.3 overs for seven runs. This would remain the best bowling performance of his first-class career, not surpassed, but he did equal it seven years later. In the following game, the last away match of the season, he took 10 Hampshire wickets for 150 runs in the match at Bournemouth. In the 1948 season as a whole, he took 91 wickets at an average of 28.07. As a tail-end left-handed batsman, he managed just 93 runs in the season at an average of 4.22.The emergence of Tony Lock as a slow left-arm bowler in 1949 brought a stuttering end of McMahon's Surrey career. Though he played in 12 first-class matches in the 1949 season, McMahon took only 19 wickets; a similar number of matches in 1950 brought 34 wickets. In 1951, he played just seven times and in 1952 only three times. In 1953, Lock split the first finger of his left hand, and played in only 11 of Surrey's County Championship matches; McMahon played as his deputy in 14 Championship matches, though a measure of their comparative merits was that Lock's 11 games produced 67 wickets at 12.38 runs apiece, while McMahon's 14 games brought him 45 wickets at the, for him, low average of 21.53. At the end of the 1953 season, McMahon was allowed to leave Surrey to join Somerset, then languishing at the foot of the County Championship and recruiting widely from other counties and other countries.\n\nSomerset cricketer\nSomerset's slow bowling in 1954 was in the hands of leg-spinner Johnny Lawrence, with support from the off-spin of Jim Hilton while promising off-spinner Brian Langford was on national service. McMahon filled a vacancy for a left-arm orthodox spinner that had been there since the retirement of Horace Hazell at the end of the 1952 season; Hazell's apparent successor, Roy Smith, had failed to realise his promise as a bowler in 1953, though his batting had advanced significantly.\nMcMahon instantly became a first-team regular and played in almost every match during his four years with the county, not missing a single Championship game until he was controversially dropped from the side in August 1957, after which he did not play in the Championship again.In the 1954 season, McMahon, alongside fellow newcomer Hilton, was something of a disappointment, according to Wisden: \"The new spin bowlers, McMahon and Hilton, did not attain to the best standards of their craft in a wet summer, yet, like the rest of the attack, they would have fared better with reasonable support in the field and from their own batsmen,\" it said. McMahon took 85 wickets at an average of 27.47 (Hilton took only 42 at a higher average). His best match was against Essex at Weston-super-Mare where he took six for 96 in the first innings and five for 45 in the second to finish with match figures of 11 for 141, which were the best of his career. He was awarded his county cap in the 1954 season, but Somerset remained at the bottom of the table.\nThe figures for the 1955 were similar: McMahon this time took 75 wickets at 28.77 apiece. There was a small improvement in his batting and the arrival of Bryan Lobb elevated McMahon to No 10 in the batting order for most of the season, and he responded with 262 runs and an average of 9.03. This included his highest-ever score, 24, made in the match against Sussex at Frome. A week later in Somerset's next match, he equalled his best-ever bowling performance, taking eight Kent wickets for 46 runs in the first innings of a match at Yeovil through what Wisden called \"clever variation of flight and spin\". These matches brought two victories for Somerset, but there were only two others in the 1955 season and the side finished at the bottom of the Championship for the fourth season running.At the end of the 1955 season, Lawrence retired and McMahon became Somerset's senior spin bowler for the 1956 season, with Langford returning from National Service as the main support. McMahon responded with his most successful season so far, taking 103 wickets at an average of 25.57, the only season in his career in which he exceeded 100 wickets. The bowling average improved still further in 1957 to 23.10 when McMahon took 86 wickets. But his season came to an abrupt end in mid-August 1957 when, after 108 consecutive Championship matches, he was dropped from the first team during the Weston-super-Mare festival. Though he played some games for the second eleven later in August, he regained his place in the first team for only a single end-of-season friendly match, and he was told that his services were not required for the future, a decision, said Wisden, that \"proved highly controversial\".\n\nSacked by Somerset\nThe reason behind McMahon's sacking did not become public knowledge for many years. In its obituary of him in 2002, McMahon was described by Wisden as \"a man who embraced the antipodean virtues of candour and conviviality\". It went on: \"Legend tells of a night at the Flying Horse Inn in Nottingham when he beheaded the gladioli with an ornamental sword, crying: 'When Mac drinks, everybody drinks!'\" The obituary recounts a further escapade in second eleven match at Midsomer Norton where a curfew imposed on the team was circumvented by \"a POW-type loop\" organised by McMahon, \"with his team-mates escaping through a ground-storey window and then presenting themselves again\". As the only Somerset second eleven match that McMahon played in at Midsomer Norton was right at the end of the 1957 season, this may have been the final straw. But in any case there had been \"an embarrassing episode at Swansea's Grand Hotel\" earlier in the season, also involving Jim Hilton, who was also dismissed at the end of the season. Team-mates and club members petitioned for McMahon to be reinstated, but the county club was not to be moved.\nAfter a period in Lancashire League cricket with Milnrow Cricket Club, McMahon moved back to London where he did office work, later contributing some articles to cricket magazines.\n\n\n== Notes and references ==\nPassage 9:\nAvital Tamir\nAvital Tamir (Hebrew: \u05d0\u05d1\u05d9\u05d8\u05dc \u05ea\u05de\u05d9\u05e8) is an Israeli musician best known for his work as the lead singer for metal band Betzefer and for his experimental pop trio On Shoulders of Giants. He was also briefly a member of fellow Betzefer bandmate Matan Cohen's death metal band Nail Within.\n\nMusical career\nBetzefer (1998\u20132016)\nAvital Tamir formed Betzefer along with guitarist Matan Cohen and drummer Roey Berman as a one-off band for a high school gig in 1998.\nWhat started as a high school gig became a big part of the lives of the band members and since then the band started working, first as a cover band and later they started recording their own material, releasing Pitz Aachbar in 2000 and the EP New Hate in 2003. In 2005, the band released its first full-length album Down Low.\nTamir was the vocalist for the band since its formation and appeared on all of the band's releases, until his departure in 2016. He was replaced by Aharon Ragoza.\n\nNail Within (2003, 2007)\nIn 2003, after Nail Within vocalist Yishay Swearts left, guitarist Matan Cohen brought his Betzefer bandmates Avital Tamir (on vocals) and Rotem Inbar (on bass) to play with the band. After few rehearsals the idea fell through and the band disbanded. Although, before those events, Tamir did guest on some live shows of Nail Within. \n\nIn 2007, before reuniting the whole line-up, Cohen brought Tamir once again to rehearse with the band. Again, the collaboration wasn't long and soon the whole old line-up reunited.\nIt is being rumored that Avital Tamir, along with Betzefer bassist Rotem Inbar, will be involved in the new proposed album by Nail Within, though this wasn't confirmed, but it is known that Matan Cohen, Avital Tamir and Rotem Inbar, are all active in Nail Within.\n\nOn Shoulders of Giants (2006\u2013present)\nIn 2006, Avital took time off from touring with Betzefer to start a new project dubbed On Shoulders of Giants together with 7% Mind Usage guitarist Idan Epshtein and Jerusalem based singer Katie Danielson. The three recorded their debut album titled Come Crashing, which was released independently on September 17, 2009. Avital handled most of the guitar duties on the record as well as the vocals, and the bass.\n\nBlack Swan (2010\u2013present)\nIn early 2010, Tamir has started the alternative/garage rock band Black Swan with ex-Got No Shame lead guitarist Matan Ergas (AKA Nose). The band has played extensively in Israel through 2010 while Betzefer was on hiatus, playing both full band electric shows, as well as many stripped-down acoustic shows, even playing one whole show in two parts: opening with acoustic and main show as a full-band.\nThe band has recorded several demos which were upped to the band's Facebook page. The band planned to record the album sometime in 2011. Around that time, Tamir promoted Betzefer's second album Freedom to the Slave Makers released in February 2011.\n\nDiscography\nBetzefer\nPitz Aachbar (2000)\nSome Tits, But No Bush (2001)\nNew Hate (2003)\nDown Low (2005)\nFreedom to The Slave Makers (2011)\nThe Devil Went Down to the Holy Land (2013)\n\nOn Shoulders of Giants\nCome Crashing (2009)\nPassage 10:\nTom Dickinson\nThomas or Tom Dickinson may refer to: \n\nThomas Dickenson, or Dickinson, merchant and politician of York, England\nThomas R.

French director Abel Gance's Napol\u00e9on (1927) had a final widescreen segment in what Gance called Polyvision. Paramount released Old Ironsides (1927), with two sequences in a widescreen process called \"Magnascope\", while MGM released Trail of '98 (1928) in a widescreen process called \"Fanthom Screen\".The film features an array of stars who were contracted to William Fox's  Fox Film Corporation at that time, including Marjorie White, Will Rogers, Charles Farrell, Janet Gaynor, George Jessel, El Brendel, Ann Pennington, Victor McLaglen, Dixie Lee, Edmund Lowe, and Frank Richardson. It also featured the first appearance of Betty Grable on film, aged 12, as a chorus girl, and Sir Harry Lauder's nephew, Harry Lauder II, a conductor for Fox, who was drafted into the chorus.\n\nPlot\nOriginally titled New Orleans Frolic, the story centers around Margie (played by Marjorie White), a singer on a showboat who, when she hears that the showboat is in financial trouble, travels to New York City in an effort to persuade all the boat's former stars to perform in a show to rescue it. She is successful and the stars all fly to New Orleans to surprise the showboat's owner, Colonel Billy Blacher, with a grand show, the proceeds of which will go to rescue the showboat.\n\nCast\nCharles E.

It was also shown in Grandeur at the Carthay Circle Theatre in Los Angeles, from February 28, 1930.\nAt a screening at the Roxy Theater, film critic Mordaunt Hall praised the cinematography, which was noted to be enhanced by the wider format. However, he regarded the film itself as \"not one that gives as full a conception of the possibilities as future films of this type will probably do.\"Owing to the Great Depression, few movie theaters invested in equipment for this format and it was soon abandoned. Fox Film Corporation's heavy investment in Grandeur technology led to William Fox losing his business, which was eventually merged in 1935 with Twentieth Century Pictures to form 20th Century Fox.

French director Abel Gance's Napol\u00e9on (1927) had a final widescreen segment in what Gance called Polyvision.

It was also shown in Grandeur at the Carthay Circle Theatre in Los Angeles, from February 28, 1930.\nAt a screening at the Roxy Theater, film critic Mordaunt Hall praised the cinematography, which was noted to be enhanced by the wider format. However, he regarded the film itself as \"not one that gives as full a conception of the possibilities as future films of this type will probably do.\"Owing to the Great Depression, few movie theaters invested in equipment for this format and it was soon abandoned. Fox Film Corporation's heavy investment in Grandeur technology led to William Fox losing his business, which was eventually merged in 1935 with Twentieth Century Pictures to form 20th Century Fox.

He directed more than 90 films between 1934 and 1978. His 1958 film That Won't Keep a Sailor Down was entered into the 1st Moscow International Film Festival. Two years later, his 1960 film Big Request Concert was entered into the 2nd Moscow International Film Festival. His career encompassed both Nazi cinema and West German productions. He also wrote several books on the 1930s and 1940s wave of German cinema.\n\nCareer\nIn his early teens, Rabenalt began his stage career directing operas at theatres in Darmstadt, Berlin and Gera. From then on to the mid-1920s he worked (though uncredited) as a production assistant on several films such including G. W. Pabst's Joyless Street (1925). After Nazi's rise to power, Rabenalt made his feature film debut directing the musical comedy, What Am I Without You (1934), which was then shortly followed with the release of the comedy Pappi (1934). He continued to work in different genres, including The Love of the Maharaja (1936), and Men Are That Way and Midsummer Night's Fire which were released in 1939.        \nThrough out the 1940s, Rabaenalt worked with melodramatic dramas and comedy. Some of his early films in the 1940s, such as Riding for Germany, supported Nazi ideology. In 1989, he said \"I had only made circus films and chamber-type entertainment films since 1941. The only Nazi film I knew was ... rides for Germany (1941), and it was admired. The first films of mine that were distributed again after the war were Circus Renz (1943) and Regimental Music (shot in 1944 under the title The Guilty of Gabriele Rottweil, the film only came to the cinemas in 1950). The controversy about ... rides for Germany came much later.After the war he resumed his stage career as a director, beginning with the East German production, Chemistry and Love (1948), satire on anti-capitalism based on a play by Bela Balasz.

During World War II, when he was 13, he left his parents home and lived alone in Budapest. During the Holocaust, his mother and two younger sisters were murdered, while his father, brother and older sister were saved. Later, he was taken to a labor camp in Yugoslavia and worked in copper mining until he was liberated by local partisans, whom he joined in fighting the Germans until his immigration to Palestine in 1944 at age 18. Atzmoni wanted to join the military, but was concerned that his slim figure would cause him to be rejected, so he said he was two years older than he was.\n\nMilitary career\nAfter immigrating to Palestine, Atzmoni joined the Jewish Settlement Police and dealt with Naharayim. Following an Arab Legion attack, he retreated with the guards and reached the nearby base of the 12th Battalion of the Golani Brigade. He joined the ranks of the brigade and after a sergeant course was stationed as a company sergeant and served in this position during the 1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War. Later, He joined the artillery corps, where he served in reserves for many years. In 1969, following severe manpower shortage in the Israel Defense Forces, he responded to a request by its Chief of General Staff and returned for a year of voluntary service in the artillery corps.\n\nDecorations\nIn September 1948, Atzmoni cleared a fire-focused ammunition box during battle and received a commendation from the brigade commander.In January 1949, Atzmoni's unit was attacked near Rafah. A military car was blocking the artillery's line of sight, preventing an effective response. Atzmoni ran, under heavy fire, and was able to start the car and move it, thus clearing the way for the artillery to act and destroy 18 enemy vehicles. For this he was awarded the Hero of Israel commendation, which is the highest commendation ever awarded by the IDF, given to only twelve soldiers:\n\n On January 4, 1949, in the battle for the cemetery in Rafah, our artillery car was stopped in the field and the entire sector was concealed in front of our cannon position. The enemy, which attacked tanks and armored vehicles accompanied by infantry, rained fire on the outpost and prevented any action to remove the car from the area. Lt. Col. Arieh Otzmany, whose job was to bring ammunition and digging equipment to the outpost, jumped at the car, managed to start it, and drove it from the front to the rear, enabling our anti-tank cannon to launch an operation that resulted in the use of nine tanks and other enemy vehicles.\n\nLater life and death\nFollowing his discharge from the military, Atzmoni settled in the Hadar neighborhood in Haifa with his wife Lea (n\u00e9e Lustig), and worked as a cab driver. Concurrently, he imported and sold car parts. The two then established the Haifa branch of car rental company Hertz, which flourished. They then established their own car rental agency, also successful, allowing him donate some earnings to charity. After decades, the couple retired to the Ahuza retirement home. He died on March 30, 2005, and was buried in Haifa with a military ceremony. He had a son, daughter and four grandchildren.\nPassage 10:\nThe Hero of My Dreams\nThe Hero of My Dreams (German: Der Held meiner Tr\u00e4ume) is a 1960 West German romantic comedy film directed by Arthur Maria Rabenalt and starring Carlos Thompson, Heidi Br\u00fchl and Peter Vogel.It was shot at the Bavaria Studios in Munich.

He directed more than 90 films between 1934 and 1978. His 1958 film That Won't Keep a Sailor Down was entered into the 1st Moscow International Film Festival. Two years later, his 1960 film Big Request Concert was entered into the 2nd Moscow International Film Festival. His career encompassed both Nazi cinema and West German productions. He also wrote several books on the 1930s and 1940s wave of German cinema.\n\nCareer\nIn his early teens, Rabenalt began his stage career directing operas at theatres in Darmstadt, Berlin and Gera. From then on to the mid-1920s he worked (though uncredited) as a production assistant on several films such including G. W. Pabst's Joyless Street (1925). After Nazi's rise to power, Rabenalt made his feature film debut directing the musical comedy, What Am I Without You (1934), which was then shortly followed with the release of the comedy Pappi (1934). He continued to work in different genres, including The Love of the Maharaja (1936), and Men Are That Way and Midsummer Night's Fire which were released in 1939.        \nThrough out the 1940s, Rabaenalt worked with melodramatic dramas and comedy. Some of his early films in the 1940s, such as Riding for Germany, supported Nazi ideology. In 1989, he said \"I had only made circus films and chamber-type entertainment films since 1941. The only Nazi film I knew was ... rides for Germany (1941), and it was admired. The first films of mine that were distributed again after the war were Circus Renz (1943) and Regimental Music (shot in 1944 under the title The Guilty of Gabriele Rottweil, the film only came to the cinemas in 1950). The controversy about ... rides for Germany came much later.After the war he resumed his stage career as a director, beginning with the East German production, Chemistry and Love (1948), satire on anti-capitalism based on a play by Bela Balasz. He continued to work on productions for East German state studio DEFA until 1948. In the 1950s, he moved into more mainstream entertainment, including the Weimar horror remake of Alraune (1952), which starred Hildegard Knef and Erich von Stroheim.            \nFrom 1960, Rabanalt worked only in television, adapting classic comedies and operettas for a mainstream audience.

During World War II, when he was 13, he left his parents home and lived alone in Budapest. During the Holocaust, his mother and two younger sisters were murdered, while his father, brother and older sister were saved. Later, he was taken to a labor camp in Yugoslavia and worked in copper mining until he was liberated by local partisans, whom he joined in fighting the Germans until his immigration to Palestine in 1944 at age 18. Atzmoni wanted to join the military, but was concerned that his slim figure would cause him to be rejected, so he said he was two years older than he was.\n\nMilitary career\nAfter immigrating to Palestine, Atzmoni joined the Jewish Settlement Police and dealt with Naharayim. Following an Arab Legion attack, he retreated with the guards and reached the nearby base of the 12th Battalion of the Golani Brigade. He joined the ranks of the brigade and after a sergeant course was stationed as a company sergeant and served in this position during the 1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War. Later, He joined the artillery corps, where he served in reserves for many years. In 1969, following severe manpower shortage in the Israel Defense Forces, he responded to a request by its Chief of General Staff and returned for a year of voluntary service in the artillery corps.\n\nDecorations\nIn September 1948, Atzmoni cleared a fire-focused ammunition box during battle and received a commendation from the brigade commander.In January 1949, Atzmoni's unit was attacked near Rafah. A military car was blocking the artillery's line of sight, preventing an effective response. Atzmoni ran, under heavy fire, and was able to start the car and move it, thus clearing the way for the artillery to act and destroy 18 enemy vehicles. For this he was awarded the Hero of Israel commendation, which is the highest commendation ever awarded by the IDF, given to only twelve soldiers:\n\n On January 4, 1949, in the battle for the cemetery in Rafah, our artillery car was stopped in the field and the entire sector was concealed in front of our cannon position. The enemy, which attacked tanks and armored vehicles accompanied by infantry, rained fire on the outpost and prevented any action to remove the car from the area. Lt. Col. Arieh Otzmany, whose job was to bring ammunition and digging equipment to the outpost, jumped at the car, managed to start it, and drove it from the front to the rear, enabling our anti-tank cannon to launch an operation that resulted in the use of nine tanks and other enemy vehicles.\n\nLater life and death\nFollowing his discharge from the military, Atzmoni settled in the Hadar neighborhood in Haifa with his wife Lea (n\u00e9e Lustig), and worked as a cab driver. Concurrently, he imported and sold car parts. The two then established the Haifa branch of car rental company Hertz, which flourished. They then established their own car rental agency, also successful, allowing him donate some earnings to charity. After decades, the couple retired to the Ahuza retirement home. He died on March 30, 2005, and was buried in Haifa with a military ceremony. He had a son, daughter and four grandchildren.\nPassage 10:\nThe Hero of My Dreams\nThe Hero of My Dreams (German: Der Held meiner Tr\u00e4ume) is a 1960 West German romantic comedy film directed by Arthur Maria Rabenalt and starring Carlos Thompson, Heidi Br\u00fchl and Peter Vogel.It was shot at the Bavaria Studios in Munich.

He is best known for his recordings of \"Skylark\" and \"'Round Midnight\" from the late 1940s to the early 1950s.\n\nMusic career\nEarly years\nParis was born and raised in Nutley, New Jersey, to an Italian-American family, where he attended Nutley High School. His uncle Chick had been a guitarist with Paul Whiteman's orchestra. Paris was a popular child entertainer in vaudeville who shared the stage with Bill \"Bojangles\" Robinson and the Mills Brothers. He tap danced from his youth and into his years in the US Army.\nAfter serving in the army during World War II, he was inspired by his friend Nat King Cole to assemble a trio featuring himself on guitar and vocals. The Jackie Paris Trio was a hit at the Onyx Club on New York's 52nd Street.\n\nRecording and performing\nHe recorded from the 1940s into the 2000s. His albums include Songs by Jackie Paris (EmArcy), Jackie Paris Sings the Lyrics of Ira Gershwin (Time), and The Song Is Paris (Impulse!). The first song that he recorded was \"Skylark\", on one of two sessions made by his trio for MGM Records in 1947. He recorded Thelonious Monk's \"Round Midnight\", which was produced by the critic Leonard Feather and featured a young Dick Hyman on piano.\nIn 1949, he toured with the Lionel Hampton Orchestra and was invited to join Duke Ellington's Orchestra, but he was too exhausted to take it. Paris was part of the Lionel Hampton Orchestra that played at the famed Cavalcade of Jazz in Los Angeles at Wrigley Field which was produced by Leon Hefflin Sr. on July 10, 1949. They did a second concert at Lane Field in San Diego on September 3, 1949. He was the only vocalist to tour as a regular member of the Charlie Parker Quintet. Unfortunately, no recordings exist of the Parker\u2013Paris combination, but there is a photograph of the two working together. He worked often with Charles Mingus, who called Paris his favorite singer and recorded with him often, including 1952's \"Paris in Blue\" and \"Duke Ellington's Sound of Love\" on the album Changes Two in 1974.\nDuring the 1960s\u201370s, Paris frequently performed with his wife at the time Anne Marie Moss.Paris performed or recorded with Bobby Scott, Charlie Shavers, Coleman Hawkins, Dizzy Gillespie, Donald Byrd, Eddie Costa, Gigi Gryce, Hank Jones, Joe Wilder, Johnny Mandel, Lee Konitz, Max Roach, Neal Hefti, Oscar Pettiford, Ralph Burns, Terry Gibbs, Tony Scott, and Wynton Kelly.\nA documentary about him, 'Tis Autumn: The Search for Jackie Paris came out in 2006.\n\nRecognition\nHe won many jazz polls and awards, including those of Down Beat, Playboy, Swing Journal, and Metronome. In 1953, he was named Best New Male Vocalist of the Year in the first Down Beat Critics Poll. The winning female vocalist was Ella Fitzgerald, who repeatedly named Paris as one of her favorites.\nIn 2001, Paris played to a standing room crowd \u2013 and to a standing ovation \u2013 at New York's Birdland jazz club in Times Square. He was virtually the only performer to have appeared at every incarnation of the famed night spot, from the legendary Birdland of the 1950s to the present.\nHe was praised by comic Lenny Bruce, who shared the bill with him on many occasions. Bruce said, \"I dig his talent. The audience loves him and he gets laughs. He is too much!\"\n\nAwards and honors\nNew Star Male Vocalist, Down Beat Critics Poll, 1953\nBest Male Vocalist, Playboy Musicians & Critics Poll, 1957\u20131961\nGold Disc Award, Lucky to Be Me, Swing Journal, 1989\n\nDiscography\nSongs by Jackie Paris (Wing, 1956)\nSkylark (Brunswick, 1957)\nThe Jackie Paris Sound (EastWest, 1958)\nThe Song Is Paris (Impulse!, 1962)\nSings the Lyrics of Ira Gershwin (Time, 1962)\nLive at the Maisonette with Anne Marie Moss (Differant Drummer, 1975)\nJackie Paris (Audiophile, 1981)\nNobody Else but Me (Audiophile, 1988)\nLucky to Be Me (EmArcy, 1989)\nLove Songs (EmArcy, 1990)\nThe Intimate Jackie Paris (Hudson, 2001)\nPassage 9:\n55 (number)\n55 (fifty-five) is the natural number following 54 and preceding 56.\n\nMathematics\n55 is \n\na triangular number (the sum of the consecutive numbers 1 to 10), and a doubly triangular number.\nthe 10th Fibonacci number.

He is best known for his recordings of \"Skylark\" and \"'Round Midnight\" from the late 1940s to the early 1950s.\n\nMusic career\nEarly years\nParis was born and raised in Nutley, New Jersey, to an Italian-American family, where he attended Nutley High School. His uncle Chick had been a guitarist with Paul Whiteman's orchestra. Paris was a popular child entertainer in vaudeville who shared the stage with Bill \"Bojangles\" Robinson and the Mills Brothers. He tap danced from his youth and into his years in the US Army.\nAfter serving in the army during World War II, he was inspired by his friend Nat King Cole to assemble a trio featuring himself on guitar and vocals. The Jackie Paris Trio was a hit at the Onyx Club on New York's 52nd Street.\n\nRecording and performing\nHe recorded from the 1940s into the 2000s. His albums include Songs by Jackie Paris (EmArcy), Jackie Paris Sings the Lyrics of Ira Gershwin (Time), and The Song Is Paris (Impulse!). The first song that he recorded was \"Skylark\", on one of two sessions made by his trio for MGM Records in 1947. He recorded Thelonious Monk's \"Round Midnight\", which was produced by the critic Leonard Feather and featured a young Dick Hyman on piano.\nIn 1949, he toured with the Lionel Hampton Orchestra and was invited to join Duke Ellington's Orchestra, but he was too exhausted to take it. Paris was part of the Lionel Hampton Orchestra that played at the famed Cavalcade of Jazz in Los Angeles at Wrigley Field which was produced by Leon Hefflin Sr. on July 10, 1949. They did a second concert at Lane Field in San Diego on September 3, 1949. He was the only vocalist to tour as a regular member of the Charlie Parker Quintet. Unfortunately, no recordings exist of the Parker\u2013Paris combination, but there is a photograph of the two working together. He worked often with Charles Mingus, who called Paris his favorite singer and recorded with him often, including 1952's \"Paris in Blue\" and \"Duke Ellington's Sound of Love\" on the album Changes Two in 1974.\nDuring the 1960s\u201370s, Paris frequently performed with his wife at the time Anne Marie Moss.Paris performed or recorded with Bobby Scott, Charlie Shavers, Coleman Hawkins, Dizzy Gillespie, Donald Byrd, Eddie Costa, Gigi Gryce, Hank Jones, Joe Wilder, Johnny Mandel, Lee Konitz, Max Roach, Neal Hefti, Oscar Pettiford, Ralph Burns, Terry Gibbs, Tony Scott, and Wynton Kelly.\nA documentary about him, 'Tis Autumn: The Search for Jackie Paris came out in 2006.\n\nRecognition\nHe won many jazz polls and awards, including those of Down Beat, Playboy, Swing Journal, and Metronome. In 1953, he was named Best New Male Vocalist of the Year in the first Down Beat Critics Poll. The winning female vocalist was Ella Fitzgerald, who repeatedly named Paris as one of her favorites.\nIn 2001, Paris played to a standing room crowd \u2013 and to a standing ovation \u2013 at New York's Birdland jazz club in Times Square. He was virtually the only performer to have appeared at every incarnation of the famed night spot, from the legendary Birdland of the 1950s to the present.\nHe was praised by comic Lenny Bruce, who shared the bill with him on many occasions. Bruce said, \"I dig his talent. The audience loves him and he gets laughs. He is too much!\"\n\nAwards and honors\nNew Star Male Vocalist, Down Beat Critics Poll, 1953\nBest Male Vocalist, Playboy Musicians & Critics Poll, 1957\u20131961\nGold Disc Award, Lucky to Be Me, Swing Journal, 1989\n\nDiscography\nSongs by Jackie Paris (Wing, 1956)\nSkylark (Brunswick, 1957)\nThe Jackie Paris Sound (EastWest, 1958)\nThe Song Is Paris (Impulse!, 1962)\nSings the Lyrics of Ira Gershwin (Time, 1962)\nLive at the Maisonette with Anne Marie Moss (Differant Drummer, 1975)\nJackie Paris (Audiophile, 1981)\nNobody Else but Me (Audiophile, 1988)\nLucky to Be Me (EmArcy, 1989)\nLove Songs (EmArcy, 1990)\nThe Intimate Jackie Paris (Hudson, 2001)\nPassage 9:\n55 (number)\n55 (fifty-five) is the natural number following 54 and preceding 56.\n\nMathematics\n55 is \n\na triangular number (the sum of the consecutive numbers 1 to 10), and a doubly triangular number.\nthe 10th Fibonacci number.

{"prompt": "Answer the question based on the given passages. Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\nAnne Elizabeth Rector\nAnne Elizabeth Rector (June 26, 1899 \u2013 February 17, 1970) was an American artist.\nRector was the daughter of Enoch J. Rector and she attended the Art Students League of New York studying under John French Sloan. Ann also studied landscape painting under Andrew Dasburg. She married Edmund Duffy and they moved to New York City in 1948, when her husband began work for the Saturday Evening Post. She later headed Rector Studios that manufactured glass top tables. Her daughter married Ivan Chermayeff, the son of Serge Ivan Chermayeff.Rector's childhood diaries were published in 2004. They had been found many years after Rector's death and described her life for the year of 1912.\nPassage 2:\nEdmund Duffy\nEdmund Duffy (March 1, 1899 \u2013 September 12, 1962), was an American editorial cartoonist.  He grew up in Jersey City, New Jersey, eventually moving to metropolitan areas. Duffy did not attend high school, but instead went into the Art Students League of New York. Duffy's career took him to London, Paris, New York, and finally to Baltimore, where he spent the majority of his professional career working for The Baltimore Sun.\nDuffy won three Pulitzer Prizes for Editorial Cartooning in 1931, 1934, and 1940. Duffy began working for the Baltimore Sun in 1924, when he was only about 25 years old, and he received high praise from the famous journalist H.L. Mencken.\n\nJournalism career\nDuffy first came into the journalism field with his submission of a page of sketches for Armistice Day. The sketches were put into the New York Tribune in the Sunday section. Duffy worked on a variety of assignments in order to save up money, then launching his European career. He moved to London and worked for the London Evening News. Duffy worked in Paris for a few years, and he finally returned to the United States in 1922. He worked for two years with both the New York Leader and the Brooklyn Eagle.\nThe longest period of his career began in 1924 when he began working for The Baltimore Sun. Duffy worked there until 1948, in order to work a less tiring job, working for the Saturday Evening Post.  Duffy drew numerous noteworthy cartoons, approaching major issues and incidents, such as lynching and the Ku Klux Klan, but also the famous Monkey Scopes Trial of 1925.\n\nDenouncing racism through art\nDuffy was known for his daring nature in relation to his work. H.L. Mencken saw promise in his work and \u201cDuffy with his sometimes savage artwork, did the kind of thing that delighted Mencken, who loved nothing more than to \u2018stir up the animals\u2019\u201d. Duffy was not afraid to please Mencken, and held nothing back  He was one of the few people of his time that would boldly approach the topic of racism.  He blatantly condemned lynching and the actions of the KKK.  This was one of his main issues that he approached during his career.  During the time period that Duffy worked it was not popular to advocate against racism, so Duffy was civil rights before it was a wide movement in the United States. S.L. Harrison, a late professor of Communication at the University of Miami, wrote that Duffy \u201cdisplayed uncommon vigor in attacking the Ku Klux Klan\u201d.\n\nScopes Trial\nJust a year after Duffy began working for The Baltimore Sun, 1925, a famous trial began in Tennessee.  Tennessee had passed a law, the Butler Act, barring teachers against the topic of evolution in the classroom, but one biology teacher, John T. Scopes, ignored the law and taught his students evolution.  Scopes decided that the students should learn evolution, even if it went against the teachings of the bible.  Since the trial was popular and a nationwide topic, Mencken took a staff from The Sun, including Duffy, to cover the trial.  \u201c[Edmund Duffy\u2019s] graphic artwork played a significant role in the public\u2019s perception of the trial proceedings reported in the pages of The Sun, then one of America\u2019s most influential newspapers\u201d.  His cartoons brought more attention to the issue, as he derided Tennessee for crushing knowledge in one of his more notable cartoons from the trial called \u2018A Closed Book in Tennessee.\u2019 \nIn this cartoon, Duffy shows a man, representing Tennessee, holding a sign that says \u201cFundamentalists Only Wanted as Teachers.\u201d  The man is standing on top of the book of knowledge, holding it shut.  Duffy knew that this powerful cartoon would cause a great response, but that is exactly what Mencken wanted and expected from him.  Many more of his cartoons from the trial held the same message, in which he was publicly shaming Tennessee for the law, the trial, and the verdict.  Mencken once said that with a good cartoonist he would not need a whole editorial staff, and a great cartoonist he found in Duffy.\n\nPulitzer Prizes\nOver Edmund Duffy's career, he won three Pulitzer Prizes, which is a lot compared to other recipients over the years.  His three prize winning cartoons are the following:\n\u201cAn Old Struggle Still Going On\u201d (1931)\nThis cartoon references the anti-communism era that began in the 1920s and 1930s.  At the time, communism was seen as being anti-religion, which is what Duffy conveys in the cartoon.  \n\u201cCalifornia Points with Pride!\u201d (1934)\nThis cartoon is one of Duffy's many anti-lynching pieces.  This one, however, deals with white on white lynching.  In California, people took two kidnappers from prison and lynched them in a park, but the Governor praised the people that did the lynching.  Duffy condemned the Governor in this cartoon.\n\u201cThe 'Outstretched Hand'\u201d (1940)\nIn this cartoon, Duffy's topic is Adolf Hitler and his brutality.  By the time the cartoon was drawn, Germany had already invaded Poland, and Duffy shows Hitler's broken promises and peace offerings.  Hitler's hand drips with blood in the image.\nPassage 3:\nAnne Evans\nAnne or Ann Evans may refer to:\n\nAnn Evans (midwife) (1840\u20131916), New Zealand nurse\nAnne Evans (poet) (1820\u20131870), English poet and composer\nAnne Evans (arts patron) (1871\u20131941), art patron in Colorado\nAnne Evans (soprano) (born 1941), British operatic soprano\nAnne Evans Estabrook, American real estate developer\n\nSee also\nMary Ann Evans, writer better known as George Eliot\nMary Anne Disraeli, n\u00e9e Evans, wife of Disraeli\nEvans (surname)\nPassage 4:\nJames Randall Marsh\nJames Randall Marsh (1896\u20131966) was an American artist and the husband of Anne Steele Marsh.\n\nBiography\nMarsh was born in 1896 in Paris, France. He was the son of Frederick Dana Marsh and Alice Randall Marsh. He was the brother of the painter Reginald Marsh.He married Anne Steele in 1925 and the couple settled in Essex Fells, New Jersey. There Marsh set up a metal forge which he used to create industrial and residential lighting fixtures. In 1948, the Marshes relocated to Pittstown, New Jersey where James continued operating a forge, expanding the operation to include decorative metal work. His work was mainly in the American Arts and Craft style.\nIn 1952, Marsh was instrumental in establishing the Hunterdon Art Museum. When an 1836 stone mill became available for sale, Marsh and his neighbors decided to turn it into an art center, with Marsh providing most of the purchase price. The museum, with workshops, is still in operation and the building is listed as Dunham's Mill on the National Register of Historic Places listings in Hunterdon County, New Jersey.In 1964, he purchased the M. C. Mulligan & Sons Quarry, also listed on the NRHP, and donated it to the Clinton Historical Museum, now known as the Red Mill Museum Village. On October 9, 1965, the James Randall Marsh Historical Park was dedicated at the museum.Marsh died on January 20, 1966, in Flemington.\nPassage 5:\nMichael Rector\nMichael Rector (born December 16, 1993) is a former American football wide receiver.

He was waived by the Lions on September 2, 2017.\nPassage 6:\nStan Rice\nStanley Travis Rice Jr. (November 7, 1942 \u2013 December 9, 2002) was an American poet and artist. He was the husband of author Anne Rice.\n\nBiography\nRice was born in Dallas, Texas, in 1942. He met his future wife Anne O'Brien in high school. They briefly attended North Texas State University together, before marrying in 1961 and moving to San Francisco in 1962, to enroll at San Francisco State University, where they both earned their bachelor's and master's degrees.\nRice was a professor of English and Creative Writing at San Francisco State University. In 1977, he received the Academy of American Poets' Edgar Allan Poe Award for Whiteboy, and in subsequent years was also the recipient of the Joseph Henry Jackson Award, as well as a writing fellowship from the National Endowment for the Arts. Rice retired after 22 years as Chairman of the Creative Writing program as well as Assistant Director of the Poetry Center in 1989.It was the death of his and Anne's first child, daughter Michele (1966\u20131972), at age six of leukemia, which led to Stan Rice becoming a published author. His first book of poems, based on his daughter's illness and death, was titled Some Lamb, and was published in 1975. He encouraged his wife to quit her work as a waitress, cook and theater usher in order to devote herself full-time to her writing, and both eventually encouraged their son, novelist Christopher Rice, to become a published author as well.\n\nRice, his wife and his son moved to Garden District, New Orleans, in 1988, where he eventually opened the Stan Rice Gallery. In 1989, they purchased the Brevard-Rice House, 1239 First Street, built in 1857 for Albert Hamilton Brevard.\nStan Rice's paintings are represented in the collections of the Ogden Museum of Southern Art and the New Orleans Museum of Art. He had a one-person show at the James W. Palmer Gallery, Vassar College, Poughkeepsie, New York. The Art Galleries of Southeastern Louisiana presented an exhibition of selected paintings in March 2005. Prospective plans are underway to present exhibitions of Rice's paintings at various locations in Mexico.In Prism of the Night, Anne Rice said of Stan: \"He's a model to me of a man who doesn't look to heaven or hell to justify his feelings about life itself. His capacity for action is admirable. Very early on he said to me, 'What more could you ask for than life itself'?\"\nPoet Deborah Garrison was Rice's editor at Alfred A. Knopf for his 2002 collection, Red to the Rind, which was dedicated to novelist son Christopher, in whose success as a writer his father greatly rejoiced. Garrison said of Rice: \"Stan really attempted to kind of stare down the world, and I admire that.\"Knopf's Victoria Wilson, who edited Anne's novels and worked with Stan Rice on his 1997 book, Paintings, was particularly impressed by his refusal to sell his artworks, saying, \"The great thing about Stan is that he refused to play the game as a painter, and he refused to play the game as a poet.\"\n\nPersonal life\nRice was an atheist.\n\nDeath\nStan Rice died of brain cancer at age 60, on December 9, 2002, in New Orleans where he lived and was survived by Anne and Christopher, as well as his mother, Margaret; a brother, Larry; and two sisters, Nancy and Cynthia.\nRice is entombed in Metairie Cemetery in New Orleans.\n\nPoetry collections\nSome Lamb (1975)\nWhiteboy (1976) (earned the Edgar Allan Poe Award from the Academy of American Poets)\nBody of Work (1983)\nSinging Yet: New and Selected Poems (1992)\nFear Itself (1997)\nThe Radiance of Pigs (1999)\nRed to the Rind (2002)\nFalse Prophet (2003) (Posthumous)\n\nPoetry video recordings\nTwo series of recordings \u2013 one from 1973 at San Francisco State University and the other from 1996 at the poet's New Orleans home by filmmaker Blair Murphy \u2013 capturing Stan Rice reading several of his poems are on the YouTube site dedicated to the poet.\n\nOther books\nPaintings (1997)\n\nFootnotes\nNotes\nPassage 7:\nStan Marks\nStan Marks is an Australian writer and journalist.

He also served as the first gentleman of Rajasthan and also as mayor of Amravati. He was a member of the Indian National Congress.\n\nEarly life\nDevisingh Ramsingh Shekhawat, who was then a lecturer in chemistry, married Pratibha Patil on 7 July 1965. The couple had a daughter and a son, Raosaheb Shekhawat, who is also a politician.Shekhawat was awarded a PhD from the University of Mumbai in 1972. Prior to his wife's elevation to her presidential role, he had been principal of a college operated by his wife's Vidya Bharati Shikshan Sanstha foundation and also a First Mayor of Amravati (1991\u20131992). Like his wife, he was a member of the Indian National Congress party. He was also an agriculturalist and a former member of the Legislative Assembly, being elected for the period 1985\u20131990 from the Amravati constituency in the Maharashtra state legislature. He lost his deposit in the 1995 contest for that constituency.Various accusations against Shekhawat and Patil emerged after the latter was nominated for the office of president. Among these was the case of Kisan Dhage, a teacher in a school run by Vidya Prasarak Shikshan Mandal in Buldana district, who committed suicide in November 1998. He left a note saying that he was committing suicide because he was tired of the mental harassment caused by Shekhawat, who was chairman of the institution, and four others. When the police registered the case as \"accidental death\", Dhage's wife appealed to the Judicial Magistrate First Class (JMFC) in Jalgaon Jamod, a tehsil in Buldana district. The JMFC ordered the police to start criminal proceedings. Shekhawat petitioned the courts seeking dismissal of charges of abetting Dhage's suicide. Two lower courts turned down this plea and by June 2007 the issue was pending in the Bombay High Court.

Rector and she attended the Art Students League of New York studying under John French Sloan. Ann also studied landscape painting under Andrew Dasburg. She married Edmund Duffy and they moved to New York City in 1948, when her husband began work for the Saturday Evening Post. She later headed Rector Studios that manufactured glass top tables. Her daughter married Ivan Chermayeff, the son of Serge Ivan Chermayeff.Rector's childhood diaries were published in 2004. They had been found many years after Rector's death and described her life for the year of 1912.\nPassage 2:\nEdmund Duffy\nEdmund Duffy (March 1, 1899 \u2013 September 12, 1962), was an American editorial cartoonist.  He grew up in Jersey City, New Jersey, eventually moving to metropolitan areas. Duffy did not attend high school, but instead went into the Art Students League of New York. Duffy's career took him to London, Paris, New York, and finally to Baltimore, where he spent the majority of his professional career working for The Baltimore Sun.\nDuffy won three Pulitzer Prizes for Editorial Cartooning in 1931, 1934, and 1940. Duffy began working for the Baltimore Sun in 1924, when he was only about 25 years old, and he received high praise from the famous journalist H.L. Mencken.\n\nJournalism career\nDuffy first came into the journalism field with his submission of a page of sketches for Armistice Day. The sketches were put into the New York Tribune in the Sunday section. Duffy worked on a variety of assignments in order to save up money, then launching his European career. He moved to London and worked for the London Evening News. Duffy worked in Paris for a few years, and he finally returned to the United States in 1922. He worked for two years with both the New York Leader and the Brooklyn Eagle.\nThe longest period of his career began in 1924 when he began working for The Baltimore Sun. Duffy worked there until 1948, in order to work a less tiring job, working for the Saturday Evening Post.  Duffy drew numerous noteworthy cartoons, approaching major issues and incidents, such as lynching and the Ku Klux Klan, but also the famous Monkey Scopes Trial of 1925.\n\nDenouncing racism through art\nDuffy was known for his daring nature in relation to his work. H.L. Mencken saw promise in his work and \u201cDuffy with his sometimes savage artwork, did the kind of thing that delighted Mencken, who loved nothing more than to \u2018stir up the animals\u2019\u201d. Duffy was not afraid to please Mencken, and held nothing back  He was one of the few people of his time that would boldly approach the topic of racism.  He blatantly condemned lynching and the actions of the KKK.  This was one of his main issues that he approached during his career.  During the time period that Duffy worked it was not popular to advocate against racism, so Duffy was civil rights before it was a wide movement in the United States. S.L. Harrison, a late professor of Communication at the University of Miami, wrote that Duffy \u201cdisplayed uncommon vigor in attacking the Ku Klux Klan\u201d.\n\nScopes Trial\nJust a year after Duffy began working for The Baltimore Sun, 1925, a famous trial began in Tennessee.  Tennessee had passed a law, the Butler Act, barring teachers against the topic of evolution in the classroom, but one biology teacher, John T. Scopes, ignored the law and taught his students evolution.  Scopes decided that the students should learn evolution, even if it went against the teachings of the bible.  Since the trial was popular and a nationwide topic, Mencken took a staff from The Sun, including Duffy, to cover the trial.  \u201c[Edmund Duffy\u2019s] graphic artwork played a significant role in the public\u2019s perception of the trial proceedings reported in the pages of The Sun, then one of America\u2019s most influential newspapers\u201d.  His cartoons brought more attention to the issue, as he derided Tennessee for crushing knowledge in one of his more notable cartoons from the trial called \u2018A Closed Book in Tennessee.\u2019 \nIn this cartoon, Duffy shows a man, representing Tennessee, holding a sign that says \u201cFundamentalists Only Wanted as Teachers.\u201d  The man is standing on top of the book of knowledge, holding it shut.  Duffy knew that this powerful cartoon would cause a great response, but that is exactly what Mencken wanted and expected from him.  Many more of his cartoons from the trial held the same message, in which he was publicly shaming Tennessee for the law, the trial, and the verdict.  Mencken once said that with a good cartoonist he would not need a whole editorial staff, and a great cartoonist he found in Duffy.\n\nPulitzer Prizes\nOver Edmund Duffy's career, he won three Pulitzer Prizes, which is a lot compared to other recipients over the years.  His three prize winning cartoons are the following:\n\u201cAn Old Struggle Still Going On\u201d (1931)\nThis cartoon references the anti-communism era that began in the 1920s and 1930s.  At the time, communism was seen as being anti-religion, which is what Duffy conveys in the cartoon.  \n\u201cCalifornia Points with Pride!\u201d (1934)\nThis cartoon is one of Duffy's many anti-lynching pieces.  This one, however, deals with white on white lynching.  In California, people took two kidnappers from prison and lynched them in a park, but the Governor praised the people that did the lynching.  Duffy condemned the Governor in this cartoon.\n\u201cThe 'Outstretched Hand'\u201d (1940)\nIn this cartoon, Duffy's topic is Adolf Hitler and his brutality.  By the time the cartoon was drawn, Germany had already invaded Poland, and Duffy shows Hitler's broken promises and peace offerings.  Hitler's hand drips with blood in the image.\nPassage 3:\nAnne Evans\nAnne or Ann Evans may refer to:\n\nAnn Evans (midwife) (1840\u20131916), New Zealand nurse\nAnne Evans (poet) (1820\u20131870), English poet and composer\nAnne Evans (arts patron) (1871\u20131941), art patron in Colorado\nAnne Evans (soprano) (born 1941), British operatic soprano\nAnne Evans Estabrook, American real estate developer\n\nSee also\nMary Ann Evans, writer better known as George Eliot\nMary Anne Disraeli, n\u00e9e Evans, wife of Disraeli\nEvans (surname)\nPassage 4:\nJames Randall Marsh\nJames Randall Marsh (1896\u20131966) was an American artist and the husband of Anne Steele Marsh.\n\nBiography\nMarsh was born in 1896 in Paris, France. He was the son of Frederick Dana Marsh and Alice Randall Marsh. He was the brother of the painter Reginald Marsh.He married Anne Steele in 1925 and the couple settled in Essex Fells, New Jersey. There Marsh set up a metal forge which he used to create industrial and residential lighting fixtures. In 1948, the Marshes relocated to Pittstown, New Jersey where James continued operating a forge, expanding the operation to include decorative metal work. His work was mainly in the American Arts and Craft style.\nIn 1952, Marsh was instrumental in establishing the Hunterdon Art Museum. When an 1836 stone mill became available for sale, Marsh and his neighbors decided to turn it into an art center, with Marsh providing most of the purchase price. The museum, with workshops, is still in operation and the building is listed as Dunham's Mill on the National Register of Historic Places listings in Hunterdon County, New Jersey.In 1964, he purchased the M. C. Mulligan & Sons Quarry, also listed on the NRHP, and donated it to the Clinton Historical Museum, now known as the Red Mill Museum Village.

Rice retired after 22 years as Chairman of the Creative Writing program as well as Assistant Director of the Poetry Center in 1989.It was the death of his and Anne's first child, daughter Michele (1966\u20131972), at age six of leukemia, which led to Stan Rice becoming a published author. His first book of poems, based on his daughter's illness and death, was titled Some Lamb, and was published in 1975. He encouraged his wife to quit her work as a waitress, cook and theater usher in order to devote herself full-time to her writing, and both eventually encouraged their son, novelist Christopher Rice, to become a published author as well.\n\nRice, his wife and his son moved to Garden District, New Orleans, in 1988, where he eventually opened the Stan Rice Gallery.

His capacity for action is admirable. Very early on he said to me, 'What more could you ask for than life itself'?\"\nPoet Deborah Garrison was Rice's editor at Alfred A. Knopf for his 2002 collection, Red to the Rind, which was dedicated to novelist son Christopher, in whose success as a writer his father greatly rejoiced. Garrison said of Rice: \"Stan really attempted to kind of stare down the world, and I admire that.\"Knopf's Victoria Wilson, who edited Anne's novels and worked with Stan Rice on his 1997 book, Paintings, was particularly impressed by his refusal to sell his artworks, saying, \"The great thing about Stan is that he refused to play the game as a painter, and he refused to play the game as a poet.\"\n\nPersonal life\nRice was an atheist.\n\nDeath\nStan Rice died of brain cancer at age 60, on December 9, 2002, in New Orleans where he lived and was survived by Anne and Christopher, as well as his mother, Margaret; a brother, Larry; and two sisters, Nancy and Cynthia.\nRice is entombed in Metairie Cemetery in New Orleans.\n\nPoetry collections\nSome Lamb (1975)\nWhiteboy (1976) (earned the Edgar Allan Poe Award from the Academy of American Poets)\nBody of Work (1983)\nSinging Yet: New and Selected Poems (1992)\nFear Itself (1997)\nThe Radiance of Pigs (1999)\nRed to the Rind (2002)\nFalse Prophet (2003) (Posthumous)\n\nPoetry video recordings\nTwo series of recordings \u2013 one from 1973 at San Francisco State University and the other from 1996 at the poet's New Orleans home by filmmaker Blair Murphy \u2013 capturing Stan Rice reading several of his poems are on the YouTube site dedicated to the poet.\n\nOther books\nPaintings (1997)\n\nFootnotes\nNotes\nPassage 7:\nStan Marks\nStan Marks is an Australian writer and journalist.

In the first innings of his first match, against Lancashire at The Oval, he took five wickets for 81 runs.In his first full season, 1948, he was Surrey's leading wicket-taker and in the last home game of the season he was awarded his county cap \u2013 he celebrated by taking eight Northamptonshire wickets for 46 runs at The Oval, six of them coming in the space of 6.3 overs for seven runs. This would remain the best bowling performance of his first-class career, not surpassed, but he did equal it seven years later. In the following game, the last away match of the season, he took 10 Hampshire wickets for 150 runs in the match at Bournemouth. In the 1948 season as a whole, he took 91 wickets at an average of 28.07. As a tail-end left-handed batsman, he managed just 93 runs in the season at an average of 4.22.The emergence of Tony Lock as a slow left-arm bowler in 1949 brought a stuttering end of McMahon's Surrey career. Though he played in 12 first-class matches in the 1949 season, McMahon took only 19 wickets; a similar number of matches in 1950 brought 34 wickets. In 1951, he played just seven times and in 1952 only three times. In 1953, Lock split the first finger of his left hand, and played in only 11 of Surrey's County Championship matches; McMahon played as his deputy in 14 Championship matches, though a measure of their comparative merits was that Lock's 11 games produced 67 wickets at 12.38 runs apiece, while McMahon's 14 games brought him 45 wickets at the, for him, low average of 21.53. At the end of the 1953 season, McMahon was allowed to leave Surrey to join Somerset, then languishing at the foot of the County Championship and recruiting widely from other counties and other countries.\n\nSomerset cricketer\nSomerset's slow bowling in 1954 was in the hands of leg-spinner Johnny Lawrence, with support from the off-spin of Jim Hilton while promising off-spinner Brian Langford was on national service. McMahon filled a vacancy for a left-arm orthodox spinner that had been there since the retirement of Horace Hazell at the end of the 1952 season; Hazell's apparent successor, Roy Smith, had failed to realise his promise as a bowler in 1953, though his batting had advanced significantly.\nMcMahon instantly became a first-team regular and played in almost every match during his four years with the county, not missing a single Championship game until he was controversially dropped from the side in August 1957, after which he did not play in the Championship again.In the 1954 season, McMahon, alongside fellow newcomer Hilton, was something of a disappointment, according to Wisden: \"The new spin bowlers, McMahon and Hilton, did not attain to the best standards of their craft in a wet summer, yet, like the rest of the attack, they would have fared better with reasonable support in the field and from their own batsmen,\" it said. McMahon took 85 wickets at an average of 27.47 (Hilton took only 42 at a higher average). His best match was against Essex at Weston-super-Mare where he took six for 96 in the first innings and five for 45 in the second to finish with match figures of 11 for 141, which were the best of his career. He was awarded his county cap in the 1954 season, but Somerset remained at the bottom of the table.\nThe figures for the 1955 were similar: McMahon this time took 75 wickets at 28.77 apiece. There was a small improvement in his batting and the arrival of Bryan Lobb elevated McMahon to No 10 in the batting order for most of the season, and he responded with 262 runs and an average of 9.03. This included his highest-ever score, 24, made in the match against Sussex at Frome. A week later in Somerset's next match, he equalled his best-ever bowling performance, taking eight Kent wickets for 46 runs in the first innings of a match at Yeovil through what Wisden called \"clever variation of flight and spin\". These matches brought two victories for Somerset, but there were only two others in the 1955 season and the side finished at the bottom of the Championship for the fourth season running.At the end of the 1955 season, Lawrence retired and McMahon became Somerset's senior spin bowler for the 1956 season, with Langford returning from National Service as the main support. McMahon responded with his most successful season so far, taking 103 wickets at an average of 25.57, the only season in his career in which he exceeded 100 wickets. The bowling average improved still further in 1957 to 23.10 when McMahon took 86 wickets. But his season came to an abrupt end in mid-August 1957 when, after 108 consecutive Championship matches, he was dropped from the first team during the Weston-super-Mare festival. Though he played some games for the second eleven later in August, he regained his place in the first team for only a single end-of-season friendly match, and he was told that his services were not required for the future, a decision, said Wisden, that \"proved highly controversial\".\n\nSacked by Somerset\nThe reason behind McMahon's sacking did not become public knowledge for many years. In its obituary of him in 2002, McMahon was described by Wisden as \"a man who embraced the antipodean virtues of candour and conviviality\". It went on: \"Legend tells of a night at the Flying Horse Inn in Nottingham when he beheaded the gladioli with an ornamental sword, crying: 'When Mac drinks, everybody drinks!'\" The obituary recounts a further escapade in second eleven match at Midsomer Norton where a curfew imposed on the team was circumvented by \"a POW-type loop\" organised by McMahon, \"with his team-mates escaping through a ground-storey window and then presenting themselves again\". As the only Somerset second eleven match that McMahon played in at Midsomer Norton was right at the end of the 1957 season, this may have been the final straw. But in any case there had been \"an embarrassing episode at Swansea's Grand Hotel\" earlier in the season, also involving Jim Hilton, who was also dismissed at the end of the season. Team-mates and club members petitioned for McMahon to be reinstated, but the county club was not to be moved.\nAfter a period in Lancashire League cricket with Milnrow Cricket Club, McMahon moved back to London where he did office work, later contributing some articles to cricket magazines.\n\n\n== Notes and references ==\nPassage 9:\nHenry Moore (cricketer)\nHenry Walter Moore (1849 \u2013 20 August 1916) was an English-born first-class cricketer who spent most of his life in New Zealand.\n\nLife and family\nHenry Moore was born in Cranbrook, Kent, in 1849. He was the son of the Reverend Edward Moore and Lady Harriet Janet Sarah Montagu-Scott, who was one of the daughters of the 4th Duke of Buccleuch. One of his brothers, Arthur, became an admiral and was knighted. Their great \ngrandfather was John Moore, Archbishop of Canterbury from 1783 to 1805. One of their sisters was a maid of honour to Queen Victoria.Moore went to New Zealand in the 1870s and lived in Geraldine and Christchurch. He married Henrietta Lysaght of H\u0101wera in November 1879, and they had one son. In May 1884 she died a few days after giving birth to a daughter, who also died.In 1886 Moore became a Justice of the Peace in Geraldine. In 1897 he married Alice Fish of Geraldine. They moved to England four years before his death in 1916.\n\nCricket career\nMoore was a right-handed middle-order batsman. In consecutive seasons, 1876\u201377 and 1877\u201378, playing for Canterbury, he made the highest score in the short New Zealand first-class season: 76 and 75 respectively. His 76 came in his first match for Canterbury, against Otago. He went to the wicket early on the first day with the score at 7 for 2 and put on 99 for the third wicket with Charles Corfe before he was out with the score at 106 for 3 after a \"very fine exhibition of free hitting, combined with good defence\". Canterbury were all out for 133, but went on to win the match. His 75 came in the next season's match against Otago, when he took the score from 22 for 2 to 136 for 6. The New Zealand cricket historian Tom Reese said, \"Right from the beginning he smote the bowling hip and thigh, going out of his ground to indulge in some forceful driving.\" Canterbury won again.Moore led the batting averages in the Canterbury Cricket Association in 1877\u201378 with 379 runs at an average of 34.4. Also in 1877\u201378, he was a member of the Canterbury team that inflicted the only defeat on the touring Australians. In 1896\u201397, at the age of 47, he top-scored in each innings for a South Canterbury XVIII against the touring Queensland cricket team.\nPassage 10:\nHartley Lobban\nHartley W Lobban (9 May 1926 \u2013 15 October 2004) was a Jamaican-born first-class cricketer who played 17 matches for Worcestershire in the early 1950s.\n\nLife and career\nLobban played little cricket in Jamaica. He went to England at the end of World War II as a member of the Royal Air Force, and settled in Kidderminster in Worcestershire in 1947, where he worked as a civilian lorry driver for the RAF. He began playing for Kidderminster Cricket Club in the Birmingham League, and at the start of the 1952 season, opening the bowling for the club's senior team, he had figures of 7 for 9 and 7 for 37.Worcestershire invited him to play for them, and he made his first-class debut against Sussex in July 1952. He took five wickets in the match (his maiden victim being Ken Suttle) and then held on for 4 not out with Peter Richardson (20 not out) to add the 12 runs needed for a one-wicket victory after his county had collapsed from 192 for 2 to 238 for 9. A week later he claimed four wickets against Warwickshire, then a few days later still he managed 6 for 52 (five of his victims bowled) in what was otherwise a disastrous innings defeat to Derbyshire. In the last match of the season he took a career-best 6 for 51 against Glamorgan; he and Reg Perks (4 for 59) bowled unchanged throughout the first innings. Worcestershire won the game and Lobban finished the season with 23 wickets at 23.69.He took 23 wickets again in 1953, but at a considerably worse average of 34.43, and had only two really successful games: against Oxford University in June, when he took 5 for 70, and then against Sussex in July. On this occasion Lobban claimed eight wickets, his most in a match, including 6 for 103 in the first innings. He also made his highest score with the bat, 18, but Sussex won by five wickets.In 1954 Lobban made only two first-class appearances, and managed only the single wicket of Gloucestershire tail-ender Bomber Wells. In his final game, against Warwickshire at Dudley, his nine first-innings overs cost 51. He bowled just two overs in the second innings as Warwickshire completed an easy ten-wicket win. Lobban played one more Second XI game, against Glamorgan II at Cardiff Arms Park; in this he picked up five wickets.\nHe was also a professional boxer and played rugby union for Kidderminster.He later moved to Canada, where he worked as a teacher in Burnaby, British Columbia.

In the first innings of his first match, against Lancashire at The Oval, he took five wickets for 81 runs.In his first full season, 1948, he was Surrey's leading wicket-taker and in the last home game of the season he was awarded his county cap \u2013 he celebrated by taking eight Northamptonshire wickets for 46 runs at The Oval, six of them coming in the space of 6.3 overs for seven runs. This would remain the best bowling performance of his first-class career, not surpassed, but he did equal it seven years later. In the following game, the last away match of the season, he took 10 Hampshire wickets for 150 runs in the match at Bournemouth. In the 1948 season as a whole, he took 91 wickets at an average of 28.07. As a tail-end left-handed batsman, he managed just 93 runs in the season at an average of 4.22.The emergence of Tony Lock as a slow left-arm bowler in 1949 brought a stuttering end of McMahon's Surrey career. Though he played in 12 first-class matches in the 1949 season, McMahon took only 19 wickets; a similar number of matches in 1950 brought 34 wickets. In 1951, he played just seven times and in 1952 only three times. In 1953, Lock split the first finger of his left hand, and played in only 11 of Surrey's County Championship matches; McMahon played as his deputy in 14 Championship matches, though a measure of their comparative merits was that Lock's 11 games produced 67 wickets at 12.38 runs apiece, while McMahon's 14 games brought him 45 wickets at the, for him, low average of 21.53. At the end of the 1953 season, McMahon was allowed to leave Surrey to join Somerset, then languishing at the foot of the County Championship and recruiting widely from other counties and other countries.\n\nSomerset cricketer\nSomerset's slow bowling in 1954 was in the hands of leg-spinner Johnny Lawrence, with support from the off-spin of Jim Hilton while promising off-spinner Brian Langford was on national service. McMahon filled a vacancy for a left-arm orthodox spinner that had been there since the retirement of Horace Hazell at the end of the 1952 season; Hazell's apparent successor, Roy Smith, had failed to realise his promise as a bowler in 1953, though his batting had advanced significantly.\nMcMahon instantly became a first-team regular and played in almost every match during his four years with the county, not missing a single Championship game until he was controversially dropped from the side in August 1957, after which he did not play in the Championship again.In the 1954 season, McMahon, alongside fellow newcomer Hilton, was something of a disappointment, according to Wisden: \"The new spin bowlers, McMahon and Hilton, did not attain to the best standards of their craft in a wet summer, yet, like the rest of the attack, they would have fared better with reasonable support in the field and from their own batsmen,\" it said. McMahon took 85 wickets at an average of 27.47 (Hilton took only 42 at a higher average). His best match was against Essex at Weston-super-Mare where he took six for 96 in the first innings and five for 45 in the second to finish with match figures of 11 for 141, which were the best of his career. He was awarded his county cap in the 1954 season, but Somerset remained at the bottom of the table.\nThe figures for the 1955 were similar: McMahon this time took 75 wickets at 28.77 apiece. There was a small improvement in his batting and the arrival of Bryan Lobb elevated McMahon to No 10 in the batting order for most of the season, and he responded with 262 runs and an average of 9.03. This included his highest-ever score, 24, made in the match against Sussex at Frome. A week later in Somerset's next match, he equalled his best-ever bowling performance, taking eight Kent wickets for 46 runs in the first innings of a match at Yeovil through what Wisden called \"clever variation of flight and spin\". These matches brought two victories for Somerset, but there were only two others in the 1955 season and the side finished at the bottom of the Championship for the fourth season running.At the end of the 1955 season, Lawrence retired and McMahon became Somerset's senior spin bowler for the 1956 season, with Langford returning from National Service as the main support. McMahon responded with his most successful season so far, taking 103 wickets at an average of 25.57, the only season in his career in which he exceeded 100 wickets. The bowling average improved still further in 1957 to 23.10 when McMahon took 86 wickets. But his season came to an abrupt end in mid-August 1957 when, after 108 consecutive Championship matches, he was dropped from the first team during the Weston-super-Mare festival. Though he played some games for the second eleven later in August, he regained his place in the first team for only a single end-of-season friendly match, and he was told that his services were not required for the future, a decision, said Wisden, that \"proved highly controversial\".\n\nSacked by Somerset\nThe reason behind McMahon's sacking did not become public knowledge for many years. In its obituary of him in 2002, McMahon was described by Wisden as \"a man who embraced the antipodean virtues of candour and conviviality\". It went on: \"Legend tells of a night at the Flying Horse Inn in Nottingham when he beheaded the gladioli with an ornamental sword, crying: 'When Mac drinks, everybody drinks!'\" The obituary recounts a further escapade in second eleven match at Midsomer Norton where a curfew imposed on the team was circumvented by \"a POW-type loop\" organised by McMahon, \"with his team-mates escaping through a ground-storey window and then presenting themselves again\". As the only Somerset second eleven match that McMahon played in at Midsomer Norton was right at the end of the 1957 season, this may have been the final straw. But in any case there had been \"an embarrassing episode at Swansea's Grand Hotel\" earlier in the season, also involving Jim Hilton, who was also dismissed at the end of the season. Team-mates and club members petitioned for McMahon to be reinstated, but the county club was not to be moved.\nAfter a period in Lancashire League cricket with Milnrow Cricket Club, McMahon moved back to London where he did office work, later contributing some articles to cricket magazines.\n\n\n== Notes and references ==\nPassage 9:\nHenry Moore (cricketer)\nHenry Walter Moore (1849 \u2013 20 August 1916) was an English-born first-class cricketer who spent most of his life in New Zealand.\n\nLife and family\nHenry Moore was born in Cranbrook, Kent, in 1849.
