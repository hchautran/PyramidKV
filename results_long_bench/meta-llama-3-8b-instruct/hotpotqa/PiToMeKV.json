The village is the site of the ancient Goguryeo city of Baegam (Hangul :\ubc31\uc554\uc131, Hanja :\u767d\u5dd6\u57ce) in Korea or Baiyan City (Chinese: \u767d\u5ca9\u57ce) in Chinese. The ancient city was the scene a major battle between the Tang dynasty Chinese emperor Taizong and the Goguryeo in 645 AD.\n\nHistory\nThe city dates to 403 AD and was built by the Goguryeo people who occupied much of the Liaodong Peninsula, modern Jilin province, Northern Korean Peninsula and part of the Primorsky Krai in modern Russia. Yanzhou was a major city at the frontier between the Goguryeo and Tang dynasty China.\nIn 642 AD, the Goguryeo had a war with the neighbouring land of Silla on the Korean Peninsula. The Silla appealed to the Tang Emperor for assistance and in 645, the Emperor Taizong attacked the Goguryeo. The Tang first captured nearby Liaodong City. Then in June, they attacked at Yanzhou led by Tang Jun and after fierce fighting and some notable heroics by the Emperor and his generals, won.\n\nLocation\nThe city was built on a ridge on the northern side of the Taizi River.  (Chinese: \u592a\u5b50\u6cb3; pinyin: T\u00e0iz\u01d0h\u00e9), approximately 20 km east of Liaoyang and 50 km south of Shenyang (Chinese: \u6c88\u9633; pinyin: Sh\u011bny\u00e1ng).\n\nConstruction\nAs with other Goguryeo forts, Yanzhou village was built on a hill adjacent to a river, with the river forming a natural barrier.  Cliffs form the southern side of the city and a high defensive wall formed an arch around the west, north and east sides.  The land slopes such that the eastern side of the city is significantly higher than the west. The site is about 480 metres long and 440 metres wide. The city walls, which are still visible today, cover some 1840 metres in length. The walls were 2 to 3 metres thick and between 5 and 8 metres high with towers at regular intervals along its length, and is comparable to the Great Wall of China in its dimensions. At the top of the ridge are the remains of a square tower with a wall enclosed area to its east. The gate to the city was to the west, near the Taizi River. The construction is of rough-cut stone built dry without mortar.\n\nStatus\nThe city walls in Yanzhou are a protected site of Liaoning province.  Despite its protected status, some of the western sections of the city walls have been dismantled by the adjacent villagers and stones taken from the wall can be seen in various homes and fences throughout the village.  By comparison, the city walls on the northern and eastern sections appear to be in good condition.\n\nAccessibility\nAs of 2014 the site was not developed to encourage tourism and there was no tourist infrastructure present to facilitate tourism related activities within the city walls. Access to the site was neither monitored nor actively controlled.\nThe city can be easily reached by automobile, as paved roads connect it to both Liaoyang and Shenyang.\nPassage 5:\nYanzhou District\nYanzhou (postal: Yenchow; simplified Chinese: \u5156\u5dde; traditional Chinese: \u5157\u5dde; pinyin: Y\u01cenzh\u014du) is a district in the prefecture-level city of Jining, in the southwest of Shandong province, People's Republic of China. It was also the name of one of the Nine Provinces in ancient China, where Yu combated floods by water control.\n\nAdministration\nYanzhou District administers six subdistricts and six towns:\n\nSubdistricts (\u8857\u9053)\nTowns (\u9547)\nHistory\nYanzhou was the first place to install the \"school-fields\" xuetian in 1022, during the Song dynasty.In early European sources, based on accounts by French missionaries, the name of Yanzhou (Fu) is transcribed in the contemporary French manner, as Yen-tcheou-fou; however, when reading 18th- and 19th-century books in French or English, care should be taken not to confuse Yanzhou in Shandong with the identically transcribed Yanzhou in Zhejiang.\n\nGeology\nThe land structure of the Yinzhou area belongs to the Luxi fault block uplift (level III) and the Zhangzhou fault (Grade IV) unit. The eastern part of the boundary is the Yishan fault, the west is the Sunshidian fault, and the north is the Wensi fault. It is the Fushan fault. Yanzhou is part of it. The basement is the metamorphic rock series of the Mount Tai Group. The Paleozoic, Mesozoic and Cenozoic strata are developed above the basement. Among them, rich industrial coal seams are formed in the Late Paleozoic strata, which is an important base for Yanzhou becoming national coal resources. The tectonic movement in the territory has shaped various structural topography, which are roughly two types of fault structure and fold structure. The strata of all walks of life are developed from the old to the new for the Early Paleozoic strata, the Paleozoic strata, the Mesozoic strata, and the Neogene stratigraphic strata. In the early Paleozoic, the horizon was in a state of slow decline, with large-scale transgression, and the deposition of thick shallow sand shale and carbonate rock formations. The Ordovician rocks in the Paleozoic are mainly light gray and gray thick layered limestone, crystalline limestone and leopard skin limestone; the Carboniferous rocks are mainly gray-white siltstone, clay rock, shale and thin layer limestone. Several layers of coal; the two rocks are mainly grayish white, dark gray sandstone and variegated mudstone and brown shale, rich in plant fossils. The Mesozoic Jurassic rocks are mainly brown sandstone, conglomerate, variegated mudstone and glutenite. The Cenozoic is made up of Tertiary and Quaternary strata. The Tertiary is sandstone, sticky sandstone, and mudstone; the Quaternary strata are loose rock formations composed of Wenyu alluvial deposits. The west is the Wenhe alluvial fan, the east is the Weihe alluvial fan, and the two overlapping alluvial fans are located in the area of Qianqian-Da'an-Tianqi Temple.\nYanzhou District is located in the sloping plain of the southwestern part of the Mount Tai in the Luzhong Mountains. The west is flooded by the flood waters, and the flood alluvial landforms are obvious; the eastern waters are discharged to the southwest, and the terrain is inclined from the northeast to the southwest; the central Guangfu River and the Yangjiahe River are parallel and the terrain is low. The ground elevation is 60~38 meters, the height difference is 22 meters and the average elevation is 49 meters, and the average slope is 1/1500. The northeast is affected by the structure and is a shallow buried area of the Tertiary, with a large slope on the ground. The plain area is 64,670 hectares, accounting for 99.7% of the total area; it is divided into three types: micro-sloping ground, depression and slow-moving. The area is 45,601 hectares, accounting for 70.35% of the total area; the area is 12276.9 hectares, accounting for 18.94% of the total area; the area is 6792.2 hectares, accounting for 10.48% of the total area.\nThe hills in the territory belong to the bedrock of the Mount Tai hidden under the Quaternary cover. There is a hill 15 kilometers west of the city, named Ziyang Mountain. It is the only hill in Yanzhou. It is a bare hill of the Ordovician limestone. It is a low hill type. It is divided into two peaks, east peak is 75 meters above sea level, and west peak is 72.5 meters above sea level. The mountain is spread from east to west, 1.5 kilometers long and one kilometer wide, covering an area of 1.5 square kilometers. The rock is limestone, and the Qing Dynasty has been sporadic mining, although it is forbidden. In the later period of the \"Cultural Revolution\", the trees on the mountain were cut down, and the mountain quarry was cut off. The East Peak had become a deep valley, and the west peak still existed.\n\nClimate\nYanzhou has a monsoon-influenced, four-season humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen Dwa). Winters are cold and dry while summers are hot and humid. Monthly daily average temperatures range from \u22121.0 \u00b0C (30.2 \u00b0F) in January to 26.8 \u00b0C (80.2 \u00b0F), while the annual mean temperature is 13.79 \u00b0C (56.8 \u00b0F).

The village is the site of the ancient Goguryeo city of Baegam (Hangul :\ubc31\uc554\uc131, Hanja :\u767d\u5dd6\u57ce) in Korea or Baiyan City (Chinese: \u767d\u5ca9\u57ce) in Chinese. The ancient city was the scene a major battle between the Tang dynasty Chinese emperor Taizong and the Goguryeo in 645 AD.\n\nHistory\nThe city dates to 403 AD and was built by the Goguryeo people who occupied much of the Liaodong Peninsula, modern Jilin province, Northern Korean Peninsula and part of the Primorsky Krai in modern Russia. Yanzhou was a major city at the frontier between the Goguryeo and Tang dynasty China.\nIn 642 AD, the Goguryeo had a war with the neighbouring land of Silla on the Korean Peninsula. The Silla appealed to the Tang Emperor for assistance and in 645, the Emperor Taizong attacked the Goguryeo. The Tang first captured nearby Liaodong City. Then in June, they attacked at Yanzhou led by Tang Jun and after fierce fighting and some notable heroics by the Emperor and his generals, won.\n\nLocation\nThe city was built on a ridge on the northern side of the Taizi River.  (Chinese: \u592a\u5b50\u6cb3; pinyin: T\u00e0iz\u01d0h\u00e9), approximately 20 km east of Liaoyang and 50 km south of Shenyang (Chinese: \u6c88\u9633; pinyin: Sh\u011bny\u00e1ng).\n\nConstruction\nAs with other Goguryeo forts, Yanzhou village was built on a hill adjacent to a river, with the river forming a natural barrier.  Cliffs form the southern side of the city and a high defensive wall formed an arch around the west, north and east sides.  The land slopes such that the eastern side of the city is significantly higher than the west. The site is about 480 metres long and 440 metres wide. The city walls, which are still visible today, cover some 1840 metres in length. The walls were 2 to 3 metres thick and between 5 and 8 metres high with towers at regular intervals along its length, and is comparable to the Great Wall of China in its dimensions. At the top of the ridge are the remains of a square tower with a wall enclosed area to its east. The gate to the city was to the west, near the Taizi River. The construction is of rough-cut stone built dry without mortar.\n\nStatus\nThe city walls in Yanzhou are a protected site of Liaoning province.  Despite its protected status, some of the western sections of the city walls have been dismantled by the adjacent villagers and stones taken from the wall can be seen in various homes and fences throughout the village.  By comparison, the city walls on the northern and eastern sections appear to be in good condition.\n\nAccessibility\nAs of 2014 the site was not developed to encourage tourism and there was no tourist infrastructure present to facilitate tourism related activities within the city walls. Access to the site was neither monitored nor actively controlled.\nThe city can be easily reached by automobile, as paved roads connect it to both Liaoyang and Shenyang.\nPassage 5:\nYanzhou District\nYanzhou (postal: Yenchow; simplified Chinese: \u5156\u5dde; traditional Chinese: \u5157\u5dde; pinyin: Y\u01cenzh\u014du) is a district in the prefecture-level city of Jining, in the southwest of Shandong province, People's Republic of China. It was also the name of one of the Nine Provinces in ancient China, where Yu combated floods by water control.\n\nAdministration\nYanzhou District administers six subdistricts and six towns:\n\nSubdistricts (\u8857\u9053)\nTowns (\u9547)\nHistory\nYanzhou was the first place to install the \"school-fields\" xuetian in 1022, during the Song dynasty.In early European sources, based on accounts by French missionaries, the name of Yanzhou (Fu) is transcribed in the contemporary French manner, as Yen-tcheou-fou; however, when reading 18th- and 19th-century books in French or English, care should be taken not to confuse Yanzhou in Shandong with the identically transcribed Yanzhou in Zhejiang.\n\nGeology\nThe land structure of the Yinzhou area belongs to the Luxi fault block uplift (level III) and the Zhangzhou fault (Grade IV) unit. The eastern part of the boundary is the Yishan fault, the west is the Sunshidian fault, and the north is the Wensi fault. It is the Fushan fault. Yanzhou is part of it. The basement is the metamorphic rock series of the Mount Tai Group. The Paleozoic, Mesozoic and Cenozoic strata are developed above the basement. Among them, rich industrial coal seams are formed in the Late Paleozoic strata, which is an important base for Yanzhou becoming national coal resources. The tectonic movement in the territory has shaped various structural topography, which are roughly two types of fault structure and fold structure. The strata of all walks of life are developed from the old to the new for the Early Paleozoic strata, the Paleozoic strata, the Mesozoic strata, and the Neogene stratigraphic strata. In the early Paleozoic, the horizon was in a state of slow decline, with large-scale transgression, and the deposition of thick shallow sand shale and carbonate rock formations. The Ordovician rocks in the Paleozoic are mainly light gray and gray thick layered limestone, crystalline limestone and leopard skin limestone; the Carboniferous rocks are mainly gray-white siltstone, clay rock, shale and thin layer limestone. Several layers of coal; the two rocks are mainly grayish white, dark gray sandstone and variegated mudstone and brown shale, rich in plant fossils. The Mesozoic Jurassic rocks are mainly brown sandstone, conglomerate, variegated mudstone and glutenite. The Cenozoic is made up of Tertiary and Quaternary strata. The Tertiary is sandstone, sticky sandstone, and mudstone; the Quaternary strata are loose rock formations composed of Wenyu alluvial deposits. The west is the Wenhe alluvial fan, the east is the Weihe alluvial fan, and the two overlapping alluvial fans are located in the area of Qianqian-Da'an-Tianqi Temple.\nYanzhou District is located in the sloping plain of the southwestern part of the Mount Tai in the Luzhong Mountains. The west is flooded by the flood waters, and the flood alluvial landforms are obvious; the eastern waters are discharged to the southwest, and the terrain is inclined from the northeast to the southwest; the central Guangfu River and the Yangjiahe River are parallel and the terrain is low. The ground elevation is 60~38 meters, the height difference is 22 meters and the average elevation is 49 meters, and the average slope is 1/1500. The northeast is affected by the structure and is a shallow buried area of the Tertiary, with a large slope on the ground. The plain area is 64,670 hectares, accounting for 99.7% of the total area; it is divided into three types: micro-sloping ground, depression and slow-moving. The area is 45,601 hectares, accounting for 70.35% of the total area; the area is 12276.9 hectares, accounting for 18.94% of the total area; the area is 6792.2 hectares, accounting for 10.48% of the total area.\nThe hills in the territory belong to the bedrock of the Mount Tai hidden under the Quaternary cover. There is a hill 15 kilometers west of the city, named Ziyang Mountain. It is the only hill in Yanzhou. It is a bare hill of the Ordovician limestone. It is a low hill type. It is divided into two peaks, east peak is 75 meters above sea level, and west peak is 72.5 meters above sea level. The mountain is spread from east to west, 1.5 kilometers long and one kilometer wide, covering an area of 1.5 square kilometers. The rock is limestone, and the Qing Dynasty has been sporadic mining, although it is forbidden. In the later period of the \"Cultural Revolution\", the trees on the mountain were cut down, and the mountain quarry was cut off. The East Peak had become a deep valley, and the west peak still existed.\n\nClimate\nYanzhou has a monsoon-influenced, four-season humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen Dwa). Winters are cold and dry while summers are hot and humid. Monthly daily average temperatures range from \u22121.0 \u00b0C (30.2 \u00b0F) in January to 26.8 \u00b0C (80.2 \u00b0F), while the annual mean temperature is 13.79 \u00b0C (56.8 \u00b0F).

It lies approximately 6 kilometres (4 mi) south of Morzeszczyn, 35 km (22 mi) south of Tczew, and 65 km (40 mi) south of the regional capital Gda\u0144sk.\nFor details of the history of the region, see History of Pomerania.\nThe village has a population of 303.\nPassage 3:\nPolj\u010dane\nPolj\u010dane (pronounced [p\u0254l\u02c8t\u0283a\u02d0n\u025b]) is a settlement in northeastern Slovenia. It is the seat of the Municipality of Polj\u010dane. It lies 35 km south of Maribor and 35 km northeast of Celje. The area is part of the traditional region of Styria. The town lies in the Dravinja Valley north of Mount Bo\u010d. It is a crossing of two important regional roads, the route from Maribor to Roga\u0161ka Slatina and the route from Celje to Ptuj. The railway line from Ljubljana to Maribor runs through the settlement, and the town has a railway station. There are also a primary school, a health centre, a post office, two supermarkets, a small inn, bars, and some restaurants.\n\nHistory\nPolj\u010dane was officially created in 1957, when the former villages of Maharska Vas and Pekel pri Polj\u010danah were merged into a single settlement.\n\nRecreation\nPolj\u010dane is a popular starting point for excursions to Mount Bo\u010d, a popular destination for day trips with mountain bikes or on foot. The top of the mountain offers a view of eastern Slovenia.\n\nEconomy\nThe town has some industry; mostly wood production, construction, and electronics. The surrounding area is also heavily cultivated. Many people commute to work to Slovenska Bistrica, Pragersko, Maribor, Slovenske Konjice, and Celje.\nPassage 4:\nElectoral district of Mawson\nMawson is a single-member electoral district for the South Australian House of Assembly. It covers the entirety of Kangaroo Island, and parts of the local government areas of Alexandrina Council, the City of Onkaparinga, and the District Council of Yankalilla. Major localities in the district include Cape Jervis, Kingscote, McLaren Vale, Port Willunga, Sellicks Beach, Willunga and Yankalilla.\nThe electorate was created in the 1969 redistribution, taking effect at the 1970 election. It is named after Sir Douglas Mawson, a geologist and explorer who made several expeditions to Antarctica. For the first three decades of its existence, it was a bellwether seat held by the party of government. This pattern was broken at the 2002 election, when Robert Brokenshire held the seat for the Liberals amidst a Labor election victory. Although it was thought that Brokenshire had established a base in Mawson, it reverted to form at the 2006 election, when Labor candidate and former journalist Leon Bignell won amid that year's massive Labor landslide. Bignell went on to increase his seat margins at the 2010 and 2014 elections. In both cases, he not only bucked the statewide trend, but also decades of voting patterns in the electorate. The 2016 redistribution ahead of the 2018 election heavily redistributed Mawson from a 5.6 percent Labor seat to a notional 3.2 percent Liberal seat, taking in areas down the coast as far as and including Kangaroo Island. However, Bignell picked up a swing of over four percent to narrowly retain the seat even as Labor lost government; he thus became its second opposition member.\n\nMembers for Mawson\nElection results\nNotes\nPassage 5:\nTymawa, Pomeranian Voivodeship\nTymawa [t\u0268\u02c8mava] (German: Thymau) is a village in the administrative district of Gmina Gniew, within Tczew County, Pomeranian Voivodeship, in northern Poland. It lies approximately 5 kilometres (3 mi) south of Gniew, 35 km (22 mi) south of Tczew, and 65 km (40 mi) south of the regional capital Gda\u0144sk. It is located within the ethnocultural region of Kociewie in the historic region of Pomerania.\n\nHistory\nThe village was given to the Order of Calatrava for protection against the Prussians in 1227. But they did not hold it for long and abandoned the endeavour by 1245.\nTymawa was a royal village of the Polish Crown, administratively located in the Tczew County in the Pomeranian Voivodeship. During the Reformation, the local church briefly passed to Protestants, however, in 1596 it was restored to Catholics by Bishop Hieronim Rozdra\u017cewski. In 1632, King W\u0142adys\u0142aw IV Vasa confirmed the possession of six w\u0142\u00f3kas of land by the local so\u0142tys. In 1780, the village was inhabited by 206 Catholics and two non-Catholics. In 1885, it had a population of 455.During the German occupation of Poland (World War II), in 1939, the local Polish parish priest was murdered by the Germans during large massacres of Poles in the Szp\u0119gawski Forest, and in 1941, the Einsatzkompanie Gotenhafen, Schutzpolizei and SS carried out expulsions of Polish farmers, who were then enslaved as forced labour and sent either to German colonists in the region or to Germany, while their farms were handed over to German colonists as part of the Lebensraum policy.\nPassage 6:\nElectoral district of Port Adelaide\nPort Adelaide is a single-member electoral district for the South Australian House of Assembly. Named after Port Adelaide, which it surrounds, it is a 118.8 km\u00b2 suburban and industrial electorate on Adelaide's Lefevre Peninsula, and stretches east toward Adelaide's northern suburbs. It contains a mix of seaside residential areas, wasteland and industrial regions. In addition to its namesake suburb of Port Adelaide, the district  includes the suburbs of Birkenhead, Bolivar, Cavan, Dry Creek, Ethelton, Exeter, Garden Island, Gepps Cross, Gillman, Glanville, Globe Derby Park, Largs Bay, Largs North, New Port, North Haven, Osborne, Ottoway, Outer Harbor, Peterhead, Semaphore, Semaphore South, St Kilda, Taperoo, Torrens Island, Wingfield, as well as part of Rosewater.\nPort Adelaide has had three incarnations as a South Australian electoral district.\nPort Adelaide was the name of an electoral district of the unicameral South Australian Legislative Council from 1851 until its abolition in 1857.From 1857 until 1902 it was a two-seat multi-member district. From 1902 until 1915 it was a large three-seat multi-member district covering Adelaide's north-west and western suburbs; together with the four-member Adelaide and five-member Torrens, the three districts with a total of 12-members covered the whole of the metropolitan area in the 42 member house.  The district returned to two members in 1915, and became a single member district from the 1938 election onward. It was held without interruption by Labor until the district's abolition prior to the 1970 election, and for most of that time was one of Labor's safest seats. The bulk of its territory was split between the neighbouring seats of Semaphore and Price.  The last member for this seat's original incarnation, John Ryan, transferred to Price.\nThe seat was recreated in 2002, essentially as a reconfigured version of Hart (which was itself created in 1993 as a replacement for Semaphore). Like its previous incarnation, it is a comfortably safe Labor seat.  The member for Hart, deputy premier and state treasurer Kevin Foley, followed most of his constituents into the recreated seat and held it easily.  At the 2006 election, Foley increased his margin from 21.7 percent to 25.7 percent, and gained a majority in all booths. Foley retired in 2011, triggering a by-election held in February 2012.  Susan Close retained the seat for Labor.\n\nMembers\nElection results\nNotes\nPassage 7:\nMcLaren Vale\nMcLaren Vale is a  wine region in the Australian state of South Australia located in the  Adelaide metropolitan area and centred on the town of McLaren Vale  about 38 kilometres (24 mi) south of the Adelaide city centre. It is internationally renowned for the wines it produces and is included within the Great Wine Capitals of the World. The region was named after either David McLaren, the Colonial Manager of the South Australia Company or John McLaren (unrelated) who surveyed the area in 1839. Among the first settlers to the region in late 1839, were two English farmers from Devon, William Colton and Charles Thomas Hewett. William Colton established the Daringa Farm and Charles Thomas Hewett established Oxenberry Farm. Both men would be prominent in the early days of McLaren Vale. Although initially the region's main economic activity was the growing of cereal crops, John Reynell and Thomas Hardy planted grape vines in 1838 and the present-day Seaview and Hardy wineries were in operation as early as 1850. Grapes were first planted in the region in 1838 and some vines more than 100 years old are still producing. Today there are more than 95 cellar doors in McLaren Vale. The majority are family-run operations and boutique wineries.\n\nGeography\nThe wine region, which is located within the southern end of the Adelaide metropolitan area, runs 30km down the coastline of the Gulf St Vincent in the west and stretches to the foothills of the Mount Lofty Ranges in the east. Its northern boundary commences at the coastline in the suburb of Hallett Cove and finishes in the foothills in the suburb of Chandlers Hill. It is located mainly within the local government area of the City of Onkaparinga with part of its northern end being in the local government area of the City of Marion.\n\nClimate\nThe McLaren Vale wine region has a Mediterranean climate with four clear seasons. With a dry and warm summer, the area typically has dry weather from December through to March or April, giving an easy change between summer and winter. The climate  is gentle with long, warm days and short, cool nights. Winter rains of 580\u2013700 mm per annum flow into a fresh spring. It rarely experiences frost or drought due to its close proximity to the sea.\n\nWines\nThe McLaren Vale wine region is well known for its dry red wines, especially those made from Shiraz, Cabernet Sauvignon and Grenache. A range of climate appropriate Mediterranean grape varieties including Mourvedre, Tempranillo, Nero d'Avola and Sangiovese are increasingly being grown. White wine varieties in the wine region include Fiano, Vermentino, Grenache blanc, Roussanne and other such Mediterranean varieties.\nNotable for producing premium Shiraz, the grape is by far the most important variety for the wine region, accounting for about 60% of the total crush. The area's diverse soils, limited water and warm summers harness Shiraz's natural vigor and produce intense flavored fruit, and wine with a deep purple color that can last decades in the bottle. McLaren Vale region has 3218 hectares of Shiraz under vine. Other major varieties include Cabernet Sauvignon with 1288 ha planted, Chardonnay with 722 ha planted, and Grenache with 402 ha\u2014much of this dry-grown (non-irrigated) bush vines. (Statistics taken from the Phylloxera and Grape Industry Board's vineyard register as of May 2005.)\n\nShiraz is harvested from late February to early April. McLaren Vale Shiraz displays pronounced berry and spice characters with some dark chocolate and liquorice, while Shiraz from cooler sub-regions exhibits defined ripe raspberry characters. McLaren Vale Shiraz is renowned for its great softness and rolling palate. Many winemakers within the wine region choose to blend their final Shiraz from a variety of sub-regions to add complexity.  The wine region naturally produces Shiraz that has very small berries. Smaller berries have a higher skin to pulp ratio. Berry skin contains flavanols (Anti-sunburn in grapes, 'flavour' in wine), Anthocyanins (colour) and other complex molecules that add to wine complexity. Grape pulp contains sugar and water. Therefore, the more skin to less pulp the more complex the finished wine. Small berries make more intense Shiraz wine. The wine region has a diversity of soil types, clones and winemaking philosophies, which has led to a huge range of Shiraz wine styles being produced. Most winemakers produce at least one Shiraz wine.\nCabernet Sauvignon is harvested in late March. Less famous than McLaren Vale Shiraz, but equally enchanting, Cabernet Sauvignon from the wine region continues to display the rich ripe characters that typify wines from this region. Violet and blackcurrant flavours, vibrant plum, mint and edges of liquorice and a touch of the wine regions trademark dark chocolate character are common.\nGrenache is harvested in late April. It is the ancient type of vine widely planted in France and Spain. It is the backbone of many of the world's red and fortified wines. Grenache vines were removed from the wine region in the 1980s when demand for fortified wines fell. Since the late 1990s Grenache has been enjoying a resurgence of popularity as table wine. The wine region's soils are particularly suited to this variety. However, in wet years it can be difficult to grow well as it can produce big bunches of grapes which make a less concentrated wine. In the best vintages Grenache displays nuances of plum, mulberry and tobacco leaf, spice and mint characters with earthy overtones.\nChardonnay is harvested in mid March. This is the major white variety in the wine region. The most pronounced and distinctive feature is ripe peaches, with the wine from cooler sites displaying white peach. These wines maintain elegance and generally have long cellaring potential. Some McLaren Vale Chardonnay also features ripe melon, banana, fig and cashew nut flavours\u2014rich and generous with pure elegance.\nSauvignon blanc is harvested in early March. Sauvignon blanc from McLaren Vale has distinctive varietal characters of tropical fruit, green olives and asparagus, and a full-flavored palate with a clean, fresh acid finish. Sauvignon blanc grown in the wine region reaches relatively high sugar levels compared with other wine regions growing this variety. The variety shows herbaceous, gooseberry, passion fruit and lychee aromas.\nPetit Verdot is one of Bordeaux's classic red grape varieties. It is a very thick-skinned grape that produces a wine of considerable depth, peppery, spicy and fragrant. Geoff Johnston of Pirramimma planted the first Australian plot at McLaren Vale in 1983 and it is only now that this wine is being recognized elsewhere. Demand for cuttings of this variety has expanded rapidly and more wines will be presented to the market in the future. Petit Verdot grapes produce wine that has the color intensity and spice of Shiraz, but with added fragrance of violets, which makes the nose very attractive.\nSangiovese is an Italian variety that does well in low fertility soils and a warm dry climate. It is slow to ripen and produces wine high in acid and tannin. The wine is deep in colour and aroma, and good for long cellaring. Sangiovese is harvested in the wine region from late March to early April.\nTempranillo is a Spanish variety that produces a red wine that matures quickly and can be ready for drinking in the year of vintage. In Spain Tempranillo is one of the most popular reds and when blended with Carignan it makes the best red wine of the Rioja region.\nVerdelho is a Portuguese white wine variety that likes low vigour soils and a warm dry climate, Verdelho has been around for some time and is enjoying an increase in popularity. It produces wines that are vivacious, fruit salad-like, dry, and best when drunk young and fresh.\nViognier is an exotic variety introduced from France where the best wines are produced in the Condrieu region. This variety exhibits exotic aromas of apricot and musk, and light oak and malolactic character; with rose, nectarine and white peach, McLaren Vale Viognier is spicy and complex with a huge spectrum of flavours.\nZinfandel is a thin-skinned grape that needs dry conditions to avoid rotting. Bunches ripen unevenly, requiring careful picking to ensure the true character is available to be further developed by the winemaker. Zinfandel is spicy in character without being particularly heavy.\n\nSoil characteristics\nThe McLaren Vale wine region has many different soil types, and this contributes to the wines from the area having different terroir. The vineyards are planted on soils including fertile red-brown earths, terra rossa, rendzina, soft sands and dark cracking clays.\nEach of these soil types contributes to the rich diversity of wine produced by the winemakers of the wine region. Overall the soils have one common trait; they are free draining which means they hold very little water. This is, in fact, an advantage, as it allows the accurate control of moisture to the vines through the use of state-of-the-art drip irrigation. Because of reliable winter rain, irrigation can be kept to low levels and manipulated to achieve the production of superior fruit.\nSome soil types allow grapes to be dry-grown. Approximately 20% of the total crop is dry-grown. These dry-grown vines are renowned for small fruit size, which is sought after for the intensity of its flavour.\nMost vineyards are found on gently undulating land at about 100m above sea level. In the foothills of the Mount Lofty Ranges to the east, where there is a scattering of vineyards, elevation rises to 320 m. At Blewitt Springs elevation is around 200 m. These variations in elevation have a significant impact on the terroir and fruit produced in the vineyards.\n\nSubregions\nThe McLaren Vale wine region has no recognised subregions, however, some wineries promote their vineyards as being in particular subregions with terroir peculiar to that part of the region. The McLaren Vale Grape Wine and Tourism Association has identified 19 distinct districts based on climate and geology.\n\nStatutory protection of parts of the wine region\nIn February 2011, South Australian Premier Mike Rann announced that the state government would \"look at ways that we can protect the unique identity and integrity of the Barossa Valley and McLaren Vale.\"  Premier Rann said: \"Barossa and McLaren Vale food and wine are key icons of South Australia. We must never allow the Barossa or McLaren Vale to become suburbs of Adelaide (sic).\"Legislation to protect the character of the Barossa Valley and McLaren Vale was reported in the media as being passed by the South Australian Parliament in 2012 and came into force in January 2013.  The statutory change consisted of an amendment to an existing item of legislation, the Development Act 1993, to create protection districts (also called Character Preservation Districts) within the relevant local government areas to replace the interim protection districts put in place on 11 April 2012.  The intention of the amendment is to ensure that the requirements for a protection district will always prevail over other development requirements where there is conflict.In the case of the McLaren Vale wine region, a character protection district with the name McLaren Vale District was created within the boundaries of the City of Onkaparinga.  The character protection district overlays a majority of the land within the local government area.  Specifically, this is land not zoned for residential and other urban uses and consists mainly of the eastern side of the local government area extending from the Sturt Creek in the north to parts of the coastal suburbs of Aldinga, Aldinga Beach, Maslin Beach, Port Willunga and Sellicks Beach in the south.\n\nSee also\nAustralian wine\nFleurieu zone (wine)\nList of wineries in McLaren Vale\nSouth Australian wine\nPassage 8:\nCradock, South Australia\nCradock is a town and locality in the Australian state of South Australia 320 kilometres north of the state capital of Adelaide on the RM Williams Way  . The nearest town with a greater population is Hawker which is approximately 20 km away with a population of around 360. Cradock is in the Flinders Ranges Council area, the state Electoral district of Stuart and the federal Division of Grey.\nThe town was surveyed during November 1878 and proclaimed on 6 March 1879.  The locality's boundaries were gazetted on 25 November 1999 and include the Government Town of Cradock and the sites of the ceased Government Towns of Charlcome and Herbert.After the South Australian government permitted settlers to go into the semi-arid lands north of Goyder's Line Cradock was established in 1879 on a 'grassy flat' of 'strong red loam', by the Wirreanda Creek. Cradock takes its name from the then Governor of South Africa, Sir John Cradock.Soon after settlement, a school, police station, two hotels, two blacksmith shops and a saddler were operating in Cradock. The \"wheat rush\" was followed by the failure of four years of crops which led to an increasing despair and a loss of many of the town's population.\n\nHistoric buildings\nCradock had three churches. The stone Catholic church opened in 1883. The Wesleyan Methodist church built in 1884 was weatherboard and iron, replaced by a stone church (construction started in 1924) which was used into the 1980s, but is now a private residence. The stone Anglican church built in 1894 was used until 1958 and is also now a private residence.The historic former St Gabriel's Catholic Church designed by Thomas Burgoyne in Main Street is listed on the South Australian Heritage Register.The town still has one hotel, the Cradock Hotel, known in earlier days as the Heartbreak Hotel.\nPassage 9:\nPenor, Pahang\nPenor is a small town in Kuantan District, Pahang, Malaysia. Located near the Kuantan-Pekan district border, it is accessible by the  Tanjung Lumpur Highway (Federal Route 183). Penor houses the jail of Pahang, Penor Jail, which is Penor's landmark. Apart from the jail, Penor is famous among locals for its calm beach and also as a fishing spot.\nPassage 10:\nBielsk, Pomeranian Voivodeship\nBielsk [bj\u025blsk] is a village in the administrative district of Gmina Morzeszczyn, within Tczew County, Pomeranian Voivodeship, in northern Poland.

It is internationally renowned for the wines it produces and is included within the Great Wine Capitals of the World. The region was named after either David McLaren, the Colonial Manager of the South Australia Company or John McLaren (unrelated) who surveyed the area in 1839. Among the first settlers to the region in late 1839, were two English farmers from Devon, William Colton and Charles Thomas Hewett. William Colton established the Daringa Farm and Charles Thomas Hewett established Oxenberry Farm. Both men would be prominent in the early days of McLaren Vale. Although initially the region's main economic activity was the growing of cereal crops, John Reynell and Thomas Hardy planted grape vines in 1838 and the present-day Seaview and Hardy wineries were in operation as early as 1850. Grapes were first planted in the region in 1838 and some vines more than 100 years old are still producing. Today there are more than 95 cellar doors in McLaren Vale. The majority are family-run operations and boutique wineries.\n\nGeography\nThe wine region, which is located within the southern end of the Adelaide metropolitan area, runs 30km down the coastline of the Gulf St Vincent in the west and stretches to the foothills of the Mount Lofty Ranges in the east. Its northern boundary commences at the coastline in the suburb of Hallett Cove and finishes in the foothills in the suburb of Chandlers Hill. It is located mainly within the local government area of the City of Onkaparinga with part of its northern end being in the local government area of the City of Marion.\n\nClimate\nThe McLaren Vale wine region has a Mediterranean climate with four clear seasons. With a dry and warm summer, the area typically has dry weather from December through to March or April, giving an easy change between summer and winter. The climate  is gentle with long, warm days and short, cool nights. Winter rains of 580\u2013700 mm per annum flow into a fresh spring. It rarely experiences frost or drought due to its close proximity to the sea.\n\nWines\nThe McLaren Vale wine region is well known for its dry red wines, especially those made from Shiraz, Cabernet Sauvignon and Grenache. A range of climate appropriate Mediterranean grape varieties including Mourvedre, Tempranillo, Nero d'Avola and Sangiovese are increasingly being grown. White wine varieties in the wine region include Fiano, Vermentino, Grenache blanc, Roussanne and other such Mediterranean varieties.\nNotable for producing premium Shiraz, the grape is by far the most important variety for the wine region, accounting for about 60% of the total crush. The area's diverse soils, limited water and warm summers harness Shiraz's natural vigor and produce intense flavored fruit, and wine with a deep purple color that can last decades in the bottle. McLaren Vale region has 3218 hectares of Shiraz under vine. Other major varieties include Cabernet Sauvignon with 1288 ha planted, Chardonnay with 722 ha planted, and Grenache with 402 ha\u2014much of this dry-grown (non-irrigated) bush vines. (Statistics taken from the Phylloxera and Grape Industry Board's vineyard register as of May 2005.)\n\nShiraz is harvested from late February to early April. McLaren Vale Shiraz displays pronounced berry and spice characters with some dark chocolate and liquorice, while Shiraz from cooler sub-regions exhibits defined ripe raspberry characters. McLaren Vale Shiraz is renowned for its great softness and rolling palate. Many winemakers within the wine region choose to blend their final Shiraz from a variety of sub-regions to add complexity.  The wine region naturally produces Shiraz that has very small berries. Smaller berries have a higher skin to pulp ratio. Berry skin contains flavanols (Anti-sunburn in grapes, 'flavour' in wine), Anthocyanins (colour) and other complex molecules that add to wine complexity. Grape pulp contains sugar and water. Therefore, the more skin to less pulp the more complex the finished wine. Small berries make more intense Shiraz wine. The wine region has a diversity of soil types, clones and winemaking philosophies, which has led to a huge range of Shiraz wine styles being produced. Most winemakers produce at least one Shiraz wine.\nCabernet Sauvignon is harvested in late March. Less famous than McLaren Vale Shiraz, but equally enchanting, Cabernet Sauvignon from the wine region continues to display the rich ripe characters that typify wines from this region. Violet and blackcurrant flavours, vibrant plum, mint and edges of liquorice and a touch of the wine regions trademark dark chocolate character are common.\nGrenache is harvested in late April. It is the ancient type of vine widely planted in France and Spain. It is the backbone of many of the world's red and fortified wines. Grenache vines were removed from the wine region in the 1980s when demand for fortified wines fell. Since the late 1990s Grenache has been enjoying a resurgence of popularity as table wine. The wine region's soils are particularly suited to this variety. However, in wet years it can be difficult to grow well as it can produce big bunches of grapes which make a less concentrated wine. In the best vintages Grenache displays nuances of plum, mulberry and tobacco leaf, spice and mint characters with earthy overtones.\nChardonnay is harvested in mid March. This is the major white variety in the wine region. The most pronounced and distinctive feature is ripe peaches, with the wine from cooler sites displaying white peach. These wines maintain elegance and generally have long cellaring potential. Some McLaren Vale Chardonnay also features ripe melon, banana, fig and cashew nut flavours\u2014rich and generous with pure elegance.\nSauvignon blanc is harvested in early March. Sauvignon blanc from McLaren Vale has distinctive varietal characters of tropical fruit, green olives and asparagus, and a full-flavored palate with a clean, fresh acid finish. Sauvignon blanc grown in the wine region reaches relatively high sugar levels compared with other wine regions growing this variety. The variety shows herbaceous, gooseberry, passion fruit and lychee aromas.\nPetit Verdot is one of Bordeaux's classic red grape varieties. It is a very thick-skinned grape that produces a wine of considerable depth, peppery, spicy and fragrant. Geoff Johnston of Pirramimma planted the first Australian plot at McLaren Vale in 1983 and it is only now that this wine is being recognized elsewhere. Demand for cuttings of this variety has expanded rapidly and more wines will be presented to the market in the future. Petit Verdot grapes produce wine that has the color intensity and spice of Shiraz, but with added fragrance of violets, which makes the nose very attractive.\nSangiovese is an Italian variety that does well in low fertility soils and a warm dry climate. It is slow to ripen and produces wine high in acid and tannin. The wine is deep in colour and aroma, and good for long cellaring. Sangiovese is harvested in the wine region from late March to early April.\nTempranillo is a Spanish variety that produces a red wine that matures quickly and can be ready for drinking in the year of vintage. In Spain Tempranillo is one of the most popular reds and when blended with Carignan it makes the best red wine of the Rioja region.\nVerdelho is a Portuguese white wine variety that likes low vigour soils and a warm dry climate, Verdelho has been around for some time and is enjoying an increase in popularity. It produces wines that are vivacious, fruit salad-like, dry, and best when drunk young and fresh.\nViognier is an exotic variety introduced from France where the best wines are produced in the Condrieu region. This variety exhibits exotic aromas of apricot and musk, and light oak and malolactic character; with rose, nectarine and white peach, McLaren Vale Viognier is spicy and complex with a huge spectrum of flavours.\nZinfandel is a thin-skinned grape that needs dry conditions to avoid rotting. Bunches ripen unevenly, requiring careful picking to ensure the true character is available to be further developed by the winemaker. Zinfandel is spicy in character without being particularly heavy.\n\nSoil characteristics\nThe McLaren Vale wine region has many different soil types, and this contributes to the wines from the area having different terroir. The vineyards are planted on soils including fertile red-brown earths, terra rossa, rendzina, soft sands and dark cracking clays.\nEach of these soil types contributes to the rich diversity of wine produced by the winemakers of the wine region. Overall the soils have one common trait; they are free draining which means they hold very little water. This is, in fact, an advantage, as it allows the accurate control of moisture to the vines through the use of state-of-the-art drip irrigation. Because of reliable winter rain, irrigation can be kept to low levels and manipulated to achieve the production of superior fruit.\nSome soil types allow grapes to be dry-grown. Approximately 20% of the total crop is dry-grown. These dry-grown vines are renowned for small fruit size, which is sought after for the intensity of its flavour.\nMost vineyards are found on gently undulating land at about 100m above sea level. In the foothills of the Mount Lofty Ranges to the east, where there is a scattering of vineyards, elevation rises to 320 m. At Blewitt Springs elevation is around 200 m. These variations in elevation have a significant impact on the terroir and fruit produced in the vineyards.\n\nSubregions\nThe McLaren Vale wine region has no recognised subregions, however, some wineries promote their vineyards as being in particular subregions with terroir peculiar to that part of the region. The McLaren Vale Grape Wine and Tourism Association has identified 19 distinct districts based on climate and geology.\n\nStatutory protection of parts of the wine region\nIn February 2011, South Australian Premier Mike Rann announced that the state government would \"look at ways that we can protect the unique identity and integrity of the Barossa Valley and McLaren Vale.\"  Premier Rann said: \"Barossa and McLaren Vale food and wine are key icons of South Australia. We must never allow the Barossa or McLaren Vale to become suburbs of Adelaide (sic).\"Legislation to protect the character of the Barossa Valley and McLaren Vale was reported in the media as being passed by the South Australian Parliament in 2012 and came into force in January 2013.  The statutory change consisted of an amendment to an existing item of legislation, the Development Act 1993, to create protection districts (also called Character Preservation Districts) within the relevant local government areas to replace the interim protection districts put in place on 11 April 2012.  The intention of the amendment is to ensure that the requirements for a protection district will always prevail over other development requirements where there is conflict.In the case of the McLaren Vale wine region, a character protection district with the name McLaren Vale District was created within the boundaries of the City of Onkaparinga.  The character protection district overlays a majority of the land within the local government area.  Specifically, this is land not zoned for residential and other urban uses and consists mainly of the eastern side of the local government area extending from the Sturt Creek in the north to parts of the coastal suburbs of Aldinga, Aldinga Beach, Maslin Beach, Port Willunga and Sellicks Beach in the south.\n\nSee also\nAustralian wine\nFleurieu zone (wine)\nList of wineries in McLaren Vale\nSouth Australian wine\nPassage 8:\nCradock, South Australia\nCradock is a town and locality in the Australian state of South Australia 320 kilometres north of the state capital of Adelaide on the RM Williams Way  . The nearest town with a greater population is Hawker which is approximately 20 km away with a population of around 360. Cradock is in the Flinders Ranges Council area, the state Electoral district of Stuart and the federal Division of Grey.\nThe town was surveyed during November 1878 and proclaimed on 6 March 1879.  The locality's boundaries were gazetted on 25 November 1999 and include the Government Town of Cradock and the sites of the ceased Government Towns of Charlcome and Herbert.After the South Australian government permitted settlers to go into the semi-arid lands north of Goyder's Line Cradock was established in 1879 on a 'grassy flat' of 'strong red loam', by the Wirreanda Creek. Cradock takes its name from the then Governor of South Africa, Sir John Cradock.Soon after settlement, a school, police station, two hotels, two blacksmith shops and a saddler were operating in Cradock. The \"wheat rush\" was followed by the failure of four years of crops which led to an increasing despair and a loss of many of the town's population.\n\nHistoric buildings\nCradock had three churches. The stone Catholic church opened in 1883. The Wesleyan Methodist church built in 1884 was weatherboard and iron, replaced by a stone church (construction started in 1924) which was used into the 1980s, but is now a private residence. The stone Anglican church built in 1894 was used until 1958 and is also now a private residence.The historic former St Gabriel's Catholic Church designed by Thomas Burgoyne in Main Street is listed on the South Australian Heritage Register.The town still has one hotel, the Cradock Hotel, known in earlier days as the Heartbreak Hotel.\nPassage 9:\nPenor, Pahang\nPenor is a small town in Kuantan District, Pahang, Malaysia.

Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\nHuernia\nThe genus Huernia (family Apocynaceae, subfamily Asclepiadoideae) consists of perennial, stem succulents from Eastern and Southern Africa and Arabia, first described as a genus in 1810.The flowers are five-lobed, usually somewhat more funnel- or bell-shaped than in the closely related genus Stapelia, and often striped vividly in contrasting colors or tones, some glossy, others matte and wrinkled depending on the species concerned. Frequently the flowers are colored a variation of red, yellow or brown. To pollinate, the flowers attract flies by emitting a scent similar to that of carrion. The genus is considered close to the genera Stapelia and Hoodia. Phylogenetic studies have shown the genus to be monophyletic, and most closely related to the genus Tavaresia, and to a widespread branch of stapeliads comprising the genera Orbea, Piaranthus and Stapelia.The name of the plant is in honor of Justus van Heurne (1587\u20131653?) a Dutch missionary, botanist, and doctor, who is reputed to have been the first European to document and collect South African Cape plants. His surname has variations (van Horne, Heurnius, van Heurnius), however it was misspelled by the plant collector.Various species of Huernia are considered famine food by the inhabitants of Konso special woreda in southern Ethiopia. The local inhabitants, who call the native species of this genus baqibaqa indiscriminately, eat it with prepared balls of sorghum (kurkufa); they note that baqibaqa tastes relatively good and has no unpleasant side-effects when boiled and consumed. As a result, local farmers encouraged it to grow on stone walls forming the terraces, where it does not compete with other crops.\n\nSpecies\nThe follow species of Huernia are found in Africa (East Africa, South Africa and Ethiopia) and Arabia (Saudi Arabia, Yemen).\nformerly includedmoved to Angolluma\n\nHuernia sprengeri now Angolluma sprengeri\nPassage 2:\nDictyosperma\nDictyosperma is a monotypic genus of flowering plant in the palm family found in the Mascarene Islands in the Indian Ocean (Mauritius, R\u00e9union and Rodrigues). The sole species, Dictyosperma album, is widely cultivated in the tropics but has been farmed to near extinction in its native habitat. It is commonly called princess palm or hurricane palm, the latter owing to its ability to withstand strong winds by easily shedding leaves. It is closely related to, and resembles, palms in the genus Archontophoenix. The genus is named from two Greek words meaning \"net\" and \"seed\" and the epithet is Latin for \"white\", the common color of the crownshaft at the top of the trunk.\n\nDescription\nThe ringed trunks are solitary at 15 cm in diameter with a slight bulge at the base, occasionally reaching up to 12 m in height. The crownshaft is over a meter tall, swollen at the base, and covered in white wax\u2014 which has given the palm its epithet album\u2014 and small, matted brown hairs, producing a rounded leaf crown 4.5 m wide and 3 m tall. The 2.5 to 3 m leaves are borne on short 30 cm petioles; the arching leaflets are pointed at the apice, from 60 \u2013 90 cm, dark green in color, and emerge from the rachis in a single plane.\nOn flowering, they produce up to six inflorescences which ring the trunk below the crownshaft, branched to one order, with white to yellow flowers, which are male and female; both pistillate and staminate flowers have three sepals and three petals, the former being smaller than the latter. The ovoid fruit ripen to purple or black in color, containing one brown, ellipsoidal seed.\nThree varieties are currently recognized:\n\nDictyosperma album var. album (Bory) Scheff. - Mauritius, R\u00e9union\nDictyosperma album var. aureum Balf.f. in J.G.Baker - Rodrigues Island\nDictyosperma album var. conjugatum H.E.Moore & J.Gu\u00e9ho - 2 remaining specimens on \u00cele Ronde of Mauritius (Characterised by shorter trunk and white leaf-scar)\n\nDistribution and habitat\nLiving in the coastal forests of the Mascarenes, they experience warm temperatures, high humidity and regular rainfall.\n\nAsterolecanium dictyospermae\nAsterolecanium dictyospermae is a species of sap sucking scale insect found only on \u00cele Ronde on the two remaining Dictyosperma album var. conjugatum specimens. It apparently evolved on \u00cele Ronde and became restricted to feeding upon the island's endemic variety, and due to interbreeding (between varieties) on Mauritius itself which jeopardized reproductive potential, the scale insect increased in population as a result of stress upon the host, which then threatens the existence of both host and scale insect.\n\nAnswer the question based on the given passages.

{"prompt": "Answer the question based on the given passages. Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\nKew, Victoria\nKew (;) is a suburb of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, 5 km east from Melbourne's Central Business District, located within the City of Boroondara local government area. Kew recorded a population of 24,499 at the 2021 census.A city in its own right from 1860 to 1994, Kew was amalgamated with the cities of Hawthorn and Camberwell to form the City of Boroondara. The suburb borders the Yarra River to the west and northwest, with Kew East to the northeast, Hawthorn and Hawthorn East to its south, and with Balwyn, Balwyn North and Deepdene to the east.\n\nHistory\nPrior to the establishment of Melbourne, the area was inhabited by the Wurundjeri peoples. In the 1840s European settlers named it the Parish of Boroondara \u2013 meaning \"a place of shade\" in the Woiwurrung language. In 1838 Dight travelled down the Yarra from Heidelberg and decided to locate a water-powered mill on a site adjacent to Dights Falls; the impressive three-storey mill opened in 1840.John Hodgson established a squatters run at Studley Park, on the eastern bank of the Yarra River, in 1840. Studley House, also known as Burke Hall, built in 1857, was named after Hodgson's birthplace of Studley, Yorkshire and the house is now on the Register of the National Estate. The house was built in the Victorian Period Italianate Revival style. Modifications were made to the house in 1875 and 1919. The house was also owned by former bookmaker, ALP lobbyist, influential Irish-Catholic and millionaire, John Wren and was donated to Xavier College by the land developer, Thomas Burke. It illustrates the importance of a residence in indicating success and status in nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century Melbourne society. The nearby Villa Alba, built before 1863, is open to the public.In 1851, Crown land sales occurred in the area. One of the purchasers, Nicholas Fenwick, subdivided his land (which was just further out from the centre of the colony of Melbourne than the area known as Richmond) and named the region Kew, based on the thought that Kew in England was near Richmond. He also notably named its streets after British statesmen. The area quickly became a sought-after suburb for the well-to-do in Melbourne. Access to Kew was originally via Bridge Road in Richmond, crossing the Hawthorn Bridge to Burwood Road, until the privately owned Studley Park Bridge (nicknamed the Penny Bridge) opened in 1857, connecting Church Street Richmond with Studley Park.\nThe commercial precinct known as Kew Junction began to take shape in the 1850s. The first store was opened by Mr. J. J. French in August 1853 and the first post office on 6 October 1856, however, it was not till towards the end of the decade that many shops appeared in High Street.

Kew recorded a population of 24,499 at the 2021 census.A city in its own right from 1860 to 1994, Kew was amalgamated with the cities of Hawthorn and Camberwell to form the City of Boroondara. The suburb borders the Yarra River to the west and northwest, with Kew East to the northeast, Hawthorn and Hawthorn East to its south, and with Balwyn, Balwyn North and Deepdene to the east.\n\nHistory\nPrior to the establishment of Melbourne, the area was inhabited by the Wurundjeri peoples. In the 1840s European settlers named it the Parish of Boroondara \u2013 meaning \"a place of shade\" in the Woiwurrung language. In 1838 Dight travelled down the Yarra from Heidelberg and decided to locate a water-powered mill on a site adjacent to Dights Falls; the impressive three-storey mill opened in 1840.John Hodgson established a squatters run at Studley Park, on the eastern bank of the Yarra River, in 1840. Studley House, also known as Burke Hall, built in 1857, was named after Hodgson's birthplace of Studley, Yorkshire and the house is now on the Register of the National Estate. The house was built in the Victorian Period Italianate Revival style. Modifications were made to the house in 1875 and 1919. The house was also owned by former bookmaker, ALP lobbyist, influential Irish-Catholic and millionaire, John Wren and was donated to Xavier College by the land developer, Thomas Burke. It illustrates the importance of a residence in indicating success and status in nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century Melbourne society. The nearby Villa Alba, built before 1863, is open to the public.In 1851, Crown land sales occurred in the area. One of the purchasers, Nicholas Fenwick, subdivided his land (which was just further out from the centre of the colony of Melbourne than the area known as Richmond) and named the region Kew, based on the thought that Kew in England was near Richmond. He also notably named its streets after British statesmen. The area quickly became a sought-after suburb for the well-to-do in Melbourne. Access to Kew was originally via Bridge Road in Richmond, crossing the Hawthorn Bridge to Burwood Road, until the privately owned Studley Park Bridge (nicknamed the Penny Bridge) opened in 1857, connecting Church Street Richmond with Studley Park.\nThe commercial precinct known as Kew Junction began to take shape in the 1850s. The first store was opened by Mr. J. J. French in August 1853 and the first post office on 6 October 1856, however, it was not till towards the end of the decade that many shops appeared in High Street. The Kew Hotel opened in 1855, the Prospect Hill Hotel (now the Dan Murphy's liquor store) in 1857, the Council Hotel about 1860, the Clifton (now Hotel Kew) in 1869 and the Greyhound (now the Skinny Dog Hotel) in 1874.

There have been talks about re-establishing this rail border crossing.\n\nSee also\nRantau Panjang railway station\nRantau Panjang\u2013Sungai Golok Bridge\nPassage 4:\nTha Chomphu Railway Station\nTha Chomphu railway station is a railway station located in Tha Pladuk Subdistrict, Mae Tha District, Lamphun.

{"prompt": "Answer the question based on the given passages. Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\nThe Goodbye Girl\nThe Goodbye Girl is a 1977 American romantic comedy-drama film directed by Herbert Ross, written by Neil Simon and starring Richard Dreyfuss, Marsha Mason, Quinn Cummings and Paul Benedict. The film, produced by Ray Stark, centers on an odd trio of characters: a struggling actor who has sublet a Manhattan apartment from a friend, the current occupant (his friend's ex-girlfriend, who has just been abandoned), and her precocious young daughter.\nRichard Dreyfuss won the 1977 Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance as Elliot Garfield. At the time, he became the youngest man (at age 30) to win an Oscar for Best Actor. Both Mason and Cummings were nominated for Oscars.\nThe film became the first romantic comedy to earn $100 million in box-office grosses.\n\nPlot\nDancer and divorcee Paula McFadden (Marsha Mason) and her ten-year-old daughter Lucy (Quinn Cummings) live in a Manhattan apartment with her married boyfriend, Tony DeForrest. Coming home from shopping, Paula finds Tony gone as he had suddenly deserted her to travel to Italy for a film role. Prior to his departure (and unbeknownst to Paula), Tony sublet the apartment to Elliot Garfield (Richard Dreyfuss), a neurotic but sweet aspiring actor from Chicago, who shows up in the middle of the night expecting to move in. Paula, who is demanding, cynical, and neurotic, makes it clear from the start that she does not like Elliot, but reluctantly lets him move in. They argue about boundaries, with Elliot agreeing to allow Paula and Lucy to stay.\nPaula is struggling to get back into shape so she can resume her career as a dancer. Meanwhile, Elliot has landed the title role in an off-off-Broadway production of Richard III, but the director, Mark (Paul Benedict), wants him to play Richard III of England as an exaggerated homosexual stereotype\u2014in Mark's words, \"the queen who wanted to be king.\" Reluctantly, Elliot agrees to the non-traditional portrayal, despite knowing that it may mean the end of his acting career. Theater critics from numerous New York City television stations and newspapers attend opening night and savage the show, paying special attention to trashing Elliot's performance. The play quickly closes, much to his relief.\nDespite their frequent clashes and Paula's lack of gratitude for Elliot's help, the two fall in love and sleep together. Lucy, despite liking Elliot, grows cautious and sees the affair as a repeat of what happened with Tony. Elliot convinces Paula that he will not be a repeat of their experience with Tony; later he picks up Lucy from school and takes her on a carriage ride, during which the youngster admits she likes Elliot. In response, Elliot explains how much he cares for Lucy and Paula and that he would not do anything to hurt them.\nElliot lands a job at an improvisational theatre, and is soon seen by a well-known film director. He is offered an opportunity for a film role that he cannot turn down, but the job is in Seattle and Elliot will be gone for four weeks. Paula is scared that Elliot is leaving her, never to return, like all the other men in her life. Later, Elliot calls Paula from the phone booth across the street to say his flight was delayed, and at the last minute, he invites Paula to go with him while he is filming, suggesting Lucy stay with Paula's friend Donna until they return. Paula declines but is encouraged by Elliot's invitation. Before hanging up, Elliot asks Paula to restring his prized guitar (which he deliberately left at the apartment), and she realizes this proves he really does love her and will indeed return.\n\nCast\nRichard Dreyfuss as Elliot Garfield\nMarsha Mason as Paula McFadden\nQuinn Cummings as Lucy McFadden\nPaul Benedict as Mark Bodine\nBarbara Rhoades as Donna Douglas\nTheresa Merritt as Mrs. Crosby\nMichael Shawn as Ronnie Burns\nPatricia Pearcy as Rhonda Fontana\nNicol Williamson as Oliver Fry (uncredited)\n\nProduction\nThe film began as a screenplay called Bogart Slept Here (essentially the story of what happened to Dustin Hoffman after he became a star) that was to star Robert De Niro and Mason for Warner Bros. It would have been the film De Niro made immediately after Taxi Driver. Mike Nichols was hired to direct.Simon recalled the original idea for the film:\n\nThe basic idea of the story was that Marsha, an ex-dancer, was married to a very promising but struggling off-Broadway actor who gets discovered in a small play and is whisked out to Hollywood, where he reluctantly moves with his family. He feels very out of place there...and they have trouble adjusting, especially after his first film makes him an international star...and it creates chaos in their marriage. The story was coming out a little darker than I had imagined, but I envisioned the character of the wife as a very good role for Marsha.\nFilming began on Bogart Slept Here but it became apparent that De Niro was not right for the role. Simon recalled: \"...it was clear that any of the humor I had written was going to get lost. It's not that De Niro is not funny, but his humor comes mostly from his nuances, a bemused expression on his face or the way he would look at a character, smile and then look up at the ceiling.\" Nichols insisted on recasting De Niro. Soon after, Nichols left the project.Dreyfuss was brought in to audition with Mason. At the end of the reading, Simon decided the chemistry was there, but the script needed work. He rewrote the screenplay in six weeks.\n\n[The screenplay] had to be funnier, more romantic, the way Marsha and I first imagined the picture would be. What I wanted to do was a prequel. In other words, instead of an off-Broadway actor, married with a child, why don't I start from the beginning? I'd start when they first meet. Not liking each other at first and then falling in love.\nThe film's exteriors were filmed in New York City and the interiors were shot on sets in Los Angeles. Warner Bros. was less than enthused about Simon's script and considered selling the project to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, but the studio ultimately decided to partner with MGM on the film instead. With the 1996 acquisition of Turner Entertainment Company, which owned the pre-May 1986 MGM film library by Time Warner, Warner Bros. now owns the rights and distribution of the film.\n\nSoundtrack\nThe title song, \"Goodbye Girl\", was written and performed by David Gates in 1977, and was a top 20 hit on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in 1977/78, peaking at #15.\n\nReception\nRoger Ebert gave the film a mostly favorable review, awarding three stars out of four. He was unimpressed with Mason's performance and the character as written, calling it \"hardly ever sympathetic.\" However, he praised Dreyfuss and cited his Richard III scenes as \"the funniest in a movie since Mel Brooks staged Springtime for Hitler.\" Ebert criticized the beginning as \"awkward at times and never quite involving,\" but \"enjoyed its conclusion so much that we almost forgot our earlier reservations.\" Gene Siskel awarded an identical three-star grade and said, \"Make no mistake about it, the very best thing about 'The Goodbye Girl' is the character of Elliot Garfield as played by Dreyfuss, a character that comes very close to Dreyfuss' own self-and-profession centered lifestyle. But like Dreyfuss himself, Elliott Garfield, who initially comes off as [a] pushy, prickly type, ultimately wins you over.\" Vincent Canby of The New York Times found the film to be \"exhausting without being much fun\" and \"relentlessly wisecracked.\" Charles Champlin of The Los Angeles Times lauded it as \"the best and most blissfully satisfying romantic comedy of the year and then some.\" Arthur D. Murphy of Variety called the film \"another feather in Herbert Ross' directorial cap,\" with Dreyfuss giving \"his best screen performance to date.\" Gary Arnold of The Washington Post wrote that the film \"evolves into the most satisfying comedy Simon has written directly for the movies. One tolerates the plot mechanics for the sake of the genuinely amusing aspects of his script, the bright remarks and the distinctive or appealing character traits that provide good performers with live ammunition.\" Pauline Kael of The New Yorker was negative, commenting, \"It's not Neil Simon's one-liners that get you down in The Goodbye Girl, it's his two-liners. The snappiness of the exchanges is so forced it's almost macabre.\" David Ansen of Newsweek wrote, \"It's pure formula, and Simon plays it straight, all cards on the table, with the conservative professionalism of a gambler used to winning. As directed by the ubiquitous Herbert Ross, The Goodbye Girl is a modest, bittersweet comedy that will delight Simon fans and leave his critics staunchly unconverted.\"On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 80% of 25 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 6.8/10.\n\nAwards and nominations\nRichard Dreyfuss was 30 when he won the Academy Award for Best Actor, making him the youngest actor ever to win the category. This record stood for 25 years until 2002 when Adrien Brody\u2014just one month shy of his 30th birthday\u2014won for The Pianist.\nAmerican Film Institute\n\nAFI's 100 Years...100 Movies \u2013 Nominated\nAFI's 100 Years...100 Laughs \u2013 Nominated\nAFI's 100 Years...100 Passions \u2013 #81\nAFI's 100 Years...100 Songs:\nThe Goodbye Girl \u2013 Nominated\nAFI's 10 Top 10 \u2013 Nominated Romantic Comedy\n\nMusical and remake\nThere were three failed attempts to turn The Goodbye Girl into a half-hour, television sitcom, according to Lee Goldberg's book Unsold Television Pilots. The first pilot, aired on NBC in May 1982 and titled Goodbye Doesn't Mean Forever, starred Karen Valentine and Michael Lembeck, and was directed by James Burrows from a script by Allan Katz. The second, unaired pilot was produced a year later starring JoBeth Williams and was directed by Charlotte Brown from a script by Brown and Pat Nardo. The third pilot, which never aired, again starred Valentine and was directed by Jay Sandrich.\nThe Goodbye Girl was developed into a 1993 Broadway musical of the same name starring Martin Short and Bernadette Peters.\nA 2004 remake with Jeff Daniels and Patricia Heaton keeps the screenplay from the original version.\n\nHome media\nThe VHS format has been released several times over the years.

It peaked at No. 11 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in the United States and was their third No. 1 hit on the easy listening chart, (following \"If\" and \"Baby I'm-a Want You\").\nRecord World called it a \"superfine superhit\" with a \"beautiful tune, apt lyric, full, rich production.\" Cash Box said \"this ballad proves [Bread's] versatility\nand ability to handle a lyric that says a bit more than 'I love you.'\"  Cash Box also said that the song \"is about performers, but is bound to be a listener's dream.\n\nChart performance\nPersonnel\nDavid Gates - lead vocals, bass, violin\nJames Griffin - acoustic guitar, harmony vocals\nLarry Knechtel - lead guitar\nMike Botts - drums\n\nCover versions\nThe song has been covered by David J on his 2003 album Estranged, Cake on their 2004 album Pressure Chief, Starflyer 59 on their 2007 vinyl collection Ghosts of the Future, and Bobby Bare Jr. on his American Bread EP.

The film, produced by Ray Stark, centers on an odd trio of characters: a struggling actor who has sublet a Manhattan apartment from a friend, the current occupant (his friend's ex-girlfriend, who has just been abandoned), and her precocious young daughter.\nRichard Dreyfuss won the 1977 Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance as Elliot Garfield. At the time, he became the youngest man (at age 30) to win an Oscar for Best Actor. Both Mason and Cummings were nominated for Oscars.\nThe film became the first romantic comedy to earn $100 million in box-office grosses.\n\nPlot\nDancer and divorcee Paula McFadden (Marsha Mason) and her ten-year-old daughter Lucy (Quinn Cummings) live in a Manhattan apartment with her married boyfriend, Tony DeForrest. Coming home from shopping, Paula finds Tony gone as he had suddenly deserted her to travel to Italy for a film role. Prior to his departure (and unbeknownst to Paula), Tony sublet the apartment to Elliot Garfield (Richard Dreyfuss), a neurotic but sweet aspiring actor from Chicago, who shows up in the middle of the night expecting to move in. Paula, who is demanding, cynical, and neurotic, makes it clear from the start that she does not like Elliot, but reluctantly lets him move in. They argue about boundaries, with Elliot agreeing to allow Paula and Lucy to stay.\nPaula is struggling to get back into shape so she can resume her career as a dancer. Meanwhile, Elliot has landed the title role in an off-off-Broadway production of Richard III, but the director, Mark (Paul Benedict), wants him to play Richard III of England as an exaggerated homosexual stereotype\u2014in Mark's words, \"the queen who wanted to be king.\" Reluctantly, Elliot agrees to the non-traditional portrayal, despite knowing that it may mean the end of his acting career. Theater critics from numerous New York City television stations and newspapers attend opening night and savage the show, paying special attention to trashing Elliot's performance. The play quickly closes, much to his relief.\nDespite their frequent clashes and Paula's lack of gratitude for Elliot's help, the two fall in love and sleep together. Lucy, despite liking Elliot, grows cautious and sees the affair as a repeat of what happened with Tony. Elliot convinces Paula that he will not be a repeat of their experience with Tony; later he picks up Lucy from school and takes her on a carriage ride, during which the youngster admits she likes Elliot. In response, Elliot explains how much he cares for Lucy and Paula and that he would not do anything to hurt them.\nElliot lands a job at an improvisational theatre, and is soon seen by a well-known film director. He is offered an opportunity for a film role that he cannot turn down, but the job is in Seattle and Elliot will be gone for four weeks. Paula is scared that Elliot is leaving her, never to return, like all the other men in her life. Later, Elliot calls Paula from the phone booth across the street to say his flight was delayed, and at the last minute, he invites Paula to go with him while he is filming, suggesting Lucy stay with Paula's friend Donna until they return. Paula declines but is encouraged by Elliot's invitation. Before hanging up, Elliot asks Paula to restring his prized guitar (which he deliberately left at the apartment), and she realizes this proves he really does love her and will indeed return.\n\nCast\nRichard Dreyfuss as Elliot Garfield\nMarsha Mason as Paula McFadden\nQuinn Cummings as Lucy McFadden\nPaul Benedict as Mark Bodine\nBarbara Rhoades as Donna Douglas\nTheresa Merritt as Mrs. Crosby\nMichael Shawn as Ronnie Burns\nPatricia Pearcy as Rhonda Fontana\nNicol Williamson as Oliver Fry (uncredited)\n\nProduction\nThe film began as a screenplay called Bogart Slept Here (essentially the story of what happened to Dustin Hoffman after he became a star) that was to star Robert De Niro and Mason for Warner Bros. It would have been the film De Niro made immediately after Taxi Driver. Mike Nichols was hired to direct.Simon recalled the original idea for the film:\n\nThe basic idea of the story was that Marsha, an ex-dancer, was married to a very promising but struggling off-Broadway actor who gets discovered in a small play and is whisked out to Hollywood, where he reluctantly moves with his family. He feels very out of place there...and they have trouble adjusting, especially after his first film makes him an international star...and it creates chaos in their marriage. The story was coming out a little darker than I had imagined, but I envisioned the character of the wife as a very good role for Marsha.\nFilming began on Bogart Slept Here but it became apparent that De Niro was not right for the role. Simon recalled: \"...it was clear that any of the humor I had written was going to get lost. It's not that De Niro is not funny, but his humor comes mostly from his nuances, a bemused expression on his face or the way he would look at a character, smile and then look up at the ceiling.\" Nichols insisted on recasting De Niro. Soon after, Nichols left the project.Dreyfuss was brought in to audition with Mason. At the end of the reading, Simon decided the chemistry was there, but the script needed work. He rewrote the screenplay in six weeks.\n\n[The screenplay] had to be funnier, more romantic, the way Marsha and I first imagined the picture would be. What I wanted to do was a prequel. In other words, instead of an off-Broadway actor, married with a child, why don't I start from the beginning? I'd start when they first meet. Not liking each other at first and then falling in love.\nThe film's exteriors were filmed in New York City and the interiors were shot on sets in Los Angeles. Warner Bros. was less than enthused about Simon's script and considered selling the project to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, but the studio ultimately decided to partner with MGM on the film instead. With the 1996 acquisition of Turner Entertainment Company, which owned the pre-May 1986 MGM film library by Time Warner, Warner Bros. now owns the rights and distribution of the film.\n\nSoundtrack\nThe title song, \"Goodbye Girl\", was written and performed by David Gates in 1977, and was a top 20 hit on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in 1977/78, peaking at #15.\n\nReception\nRoger Ebert gave the film a mostly favorable review, awarding three stars out of four. He was unimpressed with Mason's performance and the character as written, calling it \"hardly ever sympathetic.\" However, he praised Dreyfuss and cited his Richard III scenes as \"the funniest in a movie since Mel Brooks staged Springtime for Hitler.\" Ebert criticized the beginning as \"awkward at times and never quite involving,\" but \"enjoyed its conclusion so much that we almost forgot our earlier reservations.\" Gene Siskel awarded an identical three-star grade and said, \"Make no mistake about it, the very best thing about 'The Goodbye Girl' is the character of Elliot Garfield as played by Dreyfuss, a character that comes very close to Dreyfuss' own self-and-profession centered lifestyle. But like Dreyfuss himself, Elliott Garfield, who initially comes off as [a] pushy, prickly type, ultimately wins you over.\" Vincent Canby of The New York Times found the film to be \"exhausting without being much fun\" and \"relentlessly wisecracked.\" Charles Champlin of The Los Angeles Times lauded it as \"the best and most blissfully satisfying romantic comedy of the year and then some.\" Arthur D. Murphy of Variety called the film \"another feather in Herbert Ross' directorial cap,\" with Dreyfuss giving \"his best screen performance to date.\" Gary Arnold of The Washington Post wrote that the film \"evolves into the most satisfying comedy Simon has written directly for the movies. One tolerates the plot mechanics for the sake of the genuinely amusing aspects of his script, the bright remarks and the distinctive or appealing character traits that provide good performers with live ammunition.\" Pauline Kael of The New Yorker was negative, commenting, \"It's not Neil Simon's one-liners that get you down in The Goodbye Girl, it's his two-liners. The snappiness of the exchanges is so forced it's almost macabre.\" David Ansen of Newsweek wrote, \"It's pure formula, and Simon plays it straight, all cards on the table, with the conservative professionalism of a gambler used to winning. As directed by the ubiquitous Herbert Ross, The Goodbye Girl is a modest, bittersweet comedy that will delight Simon fans and leave his critics staunchly unconverted.\"On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 80% of 25 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 6.8/10.\n\nAwards and nominations\nRichard Dreyfuss was 30 when he won the Academy Award for Best Actor, making him the youngest actor ever to win the category. This record stood for 25 years until 2002 when Adrien Brody\u2014just one month shy of his 30th birthday\u2014won for The Pianist.\nAmerican Film Institute\n\nAFI's 100 Years...100 Movies \u2013 Nominated\nAFI's 100 Years...100 Laughs \u2013 Nominated\nAFI's 100 Years...100 Passions \u2013 #81\nAFI's 100 Years...100 Songs:\nThe Goodbye Girl \u2013 Nominated\nAFI's 10 Top 10 \u2013 Nominated Romantic Comedy\n\nMusical and remake\nThere were three failed attempts to turn The Goodbye Girl into a half-hour, television sitcom, according to Lee Goldberg's book Unsold Television Pilots.

The second, unaired pilot was produced a year later starring JoBeth Williams and was directed by Charlotte Brown from a script by Brown and Pat Nardo. The third pilot, which never aired, again starred Valentine and was directed by Jay Sandrich.\nThe Goodbye Girl was developed into a 1993 Broadway musical of the same name starring Martin Short and Bernadette Peters.\nA 2004 remake with Jeff Daniels and Patricia Heaton keeps the screenplay from the original version.\n\nHome media\nThe VHS format has been released several times over the years.

It relies on various melodic resources such as orchestral strings, acoustic guitar, celeste, and orchestra bells. In the lyrics, the singer talks about a longing for a girl named Aubrey for whom he had unrequited love (\"the hearts that never played in tune\"); perhaps a first love.\n\nChart history\nCover versions\n\"Aubrey\" was covered by jazz saxophonist Grover Washington, Jr. on his 1973 album Soul Box.\"Aubrey\" was later recorded by Perry Como and included on his 1973 album  And I Love You So.Scarborough Faire included an instrumental version of \"Aubrey\" on their self-titled album in 2011.\n\nSamples\nA soul-jazz interpretation of the main melody from Washington's cover was sampled on the 1998 song \"Step to My Girl\" by Oakland-based hip-hop group Souls of Mischief. This version provided inspiration in turn for the song \"Step\" by American indie rock band Vampire Weekend.\n\nLegacy\nActress Aubrey Plaza is named after this song.\nPassage 6:\nThe Guitar Man\n\"The Guitar Man\" is a song written by David Gates and originally recorded by the rock group Bread. It first appeared on Bread's 1972 album, Guitar Man. It is a mixture of the sounds of soft rock, including strings and acoustic guitar, and the addition of a wah-wah effect electric guitar, played by Larry Knechtel. It peaked at No. 11 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in the United States and was their third No. 1 hit on the easy listening chart, (following \"If\" and \"Baby I'm-a Want You\").\nRecord World called it a \"superfine superhit\" with a \"beautiful tune, apt lyric, full, rich production.\" Cash Box said \"this ballad proves [Bread's] versatility\nand ability to handle a lyric that says a bit more than 'I love you.'\"  Cash Box also said that the song \"is about performers, but is bound to be a listener's dream.\n\nChart performance\nPersonnel\nDavid Gates - lead vocals, bass, violin\nJames Griffin - acoustic guitar, harmony vocals\nLarry Knechtel - lead guitar\nMike Botts - drums\n\nCover versions\nThe song has been covered by David J on his 2003 album Estranged, Cake on their 2004 album Pressure Chief, Starflyer 59 on their 2007 vinyl collection Ghosts of the Future, and Bobby Bare Jr. on his American Bread EP.

{"prompt": "Answer the question based on the given passages. Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\nKentucky Route 160\nKentucky Route 160, also known as KY 160, is a state highway in the U.S. state of Kentucky. It runs from the Virginia state line, where the roadway continues east to Appalachia, Virginia as State Route 160, north via Lynch, Benham, Clutts, Cumberland, Sand Hill, Gordon, Linefork, Kings Creek, Premium, and Hot Spot to Kentucky Route 15 at Van. KY 160 overlaps KY 15 through Isom to Cody, where it splits to run via Carr Creek, Brinkley, and Hindman, ending at Kentucky Route 1087 at Vest. Due to the mountainous terrain and numerous tight bends. KY 160 is signposted closed to tractor-trailers from Lynch to the Virginia state line. \n\nKY 160 is part of the State Primary System from Virginia to the U.S. Highway 119 interchange in Cumberland, the State Secondary System from US 119 to KY 15 at Van and from KY 15 at Cody to Kentucky Route 80 north of Hindman, and the Rural Secondary System from KY 80 to KY 1087 at Vest.\n\nMajor intersections\nPassage 2:\nKentucky Route 686\nKentucky Route 686 (KY 686) is a 6.333-mile (10.192 km) state highway around the city of Mount Sterling, Kentucky. The route begins at Kentucky Route 11 and U.S. Route 460 north of the city and goes counter-clockwise, ending at U.S. Route 60 east of downtown. The western portion of the bypass from KY 11 south of the city to US 460 north of the city was completed in late 1985 as a four-lane highway. East of the southern junction with US 460 to the eastern terminus at US 60, KY 686 is a 2.827-mile (4.550 km) two-lane highway on a four-lane right-of-way and was completed in the early 2000s.\n\nRoute description\nKY 686 begins at an intersection with US 460/KY 11 in the northern part of Mount Sterling, heading west on four-lane divided Indian Mound Drive. The road passes through business areas, curving to the south. The route intersects KY 713 before coming to a junction with US 60. Past US 60, KY 686 heads through residential areas with some businesses, turning to the east. The road intersects KY 11 again and passes more development in the southern part of Mount Sterling before coming to another junction with US 460. Following this intersection, the route heads northeast into agricultural areas and narrows into a two-lane undivided road, crossing KY 713 again. KY 686 curves to the north and passes through more rural areas before heading near residential and commercial development and ending at another intersection with US 60 to the east of Mount Sterling.\n\nMajor intersections\nThe entire route is in Montgomery County.\nPassage 3:\nOldham County, Kentucky\nOldham County is a county located in the north central part of the U.S. state and commonwealth of Kentucky. As of the 2020 census, the population was 67,607. Its county seat is La Grange. The county is named for Colonel William Oldham.\nOldham County is part of the Louisville/Jefferson County, KY\u2013IN Metropolitan Statistical Area.\nOldham County is the wealthiest county in Kentucky and 47th-wealthiest county in the U.S. and ranks as the most educated county in Kentucky  While the causes for this are complicated, areas east of Louisville have long been popular with wealthy residents, initially as summer residences and eventually as year-round suburban estates and bedroom communities. Oldham County lies northeast of the best known of these areas, Anchorage, just outside Louisville's pre-merger East End.\n\nHistory\nOldham County was established on December 15, 1823, from parts of Henry, Jefferson, and Shelby Counties. It was the 74th Kentucky county, and was named in honor of Col. William Oldham of Jefferson County, a Revolutionary War officer.Initially, it was mainly a rural county with small, scattered developments in places like Westport which was founded in 1800 and served as the county seat early on. When the Louisville and Frankfort Railroad Company introduced rail lines in the area in the 1850s, many new towns and communities sprang up. Eventually the railroad ceased operating as a form of public transportation, but the more rural nature of the county continued to draw residents away from the metropolitan areas in Jefferson County. Since the early 1970s and the completion of Interstate 71, which connects Oldham County to Downtown Louisville and shopping in Eastern Jefferson County, Oldham County has increasingly become suburban in nature, a natural extension of Louisville's wealthy East End as it ran out of large tracts of undeveloped land.\n\nGeography\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the county has a total area of 196 square miles (510 km2), of which 187 square miles (480 km2) are land and 9.2 square miles (24 km2) (4.7%) are covered by water. It is the 13th-smallest county in Kentucky. The county's northern border with Indiana is formed by the Ohio River.\n\nAdjacent counties\nClark County, Indiana (northwest)\nTrimble County (northeast)\nHenry County (east)\nShelby County (southeast)\nJefferson County (southwest)\n\nDemographics\nAs of the census of 2000, there were 46,178 people, 14,856 households, and 12,196 families residing in the county. The population density was 244 per square mile (94/km2). There were 15,541 housing units at an average density of 82 per square mile (32/km2). The racial makeup of the county was 93.62% White, 4.21% Black or African American, 0.21% Native American, 0.44% Asian, 0.01% Pacific Islander, 0.55% from other races, and 0.97% from two or more races. 1.30% of the population were Hispanic or Latino of any race.\nThere were 14,856 households, out of which 44.10% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 71.50% were married couples living together, 7.80% had a female householder with no husband present, and 17.90% were non-families. 14.90% of all households were made up of individuals, and 4.80% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.85 and the average family size was 3.17.\nThe age distribution was 27.40% under the age of 18, 6.90% from 18 to 24, 33.10% from 25 to 44, 25.60% from 45 to 64, and 7.00% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 37 years. For every 100 females, there were 114.00 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 117.90 males.\nThe median income for a household in the county was $70,171 (2005), and the median income for a family was $70,495. Males had a median income of $46,962 versus $28,985 for females. The per capita income for the county was $25,374.  About 2.90% of families and 4.10% of the population were below the poverty line, including 4.50% of those under age 18 and 6.00% of those age 65 or over. Oldham County is the most affluent county in the state of Kentucky; most residents work in Louisville and choose to live in Oldham County due to the lack of crime and the nationally recognized school system. North Oldham High School in particular, is ranked very highly among state high schools, having been named a national blue ribbon school of excellence, and ranked in the top 250 best schools in the nation through US Weekly. 2006 classes at Oldham County High School were reported as to have a teacher:student ratio of 1:15, but that number does not accurately reflect the ratio of a normal class.  That number includes, for example, the small classes of five to six students in Behavioral Disorders.  The published ratio also includes small classes at the County Career Center, which is located on the same campus.  The actual teacher-student ratios are closer to 1:30.

West of the river, KY 3016 turns northeast onto Paris Pike, on which the highway runs concurrently with US 27 Bus. and KY 32. The route splits onto Old Leesburg Pike, which crosses and then parallels Grays Run and Paris Pike, which runs along the south side of Grays Run on its way to its river crossing and downtown Cynthiana. At Grays Run's confluence with the South Fork Licking River, KY 3016 curves north onto River Road, which the route follows to its northern terminus at a five-way intersection with KY 36, KY 356, and White Oak Pike. KY 36 heads east along Pleasant Street into downtown Cynthiana and north on Williamstown Road, and KY 356 heads west on Pleasant Street. The Kentucky Transportation Cabinet classifies KY 3016 as a state secondary highway along its independent course; its concurrency with US 27 Bus. and KY 32 is a state primary highway.\n\nHistory\nThe Kentucky Transportation Cabinet established KY 3016 as a rural secondary highway between Paris Pike, which then included mainline US 27, and Pleasant Street through a May 4, 1987, official order. The agency reclassified the highway as a state secondary highway via an October 19, 2004, official order. The cabinet extended KY 3016 south from US 27 along Ladish Road and Safety Way to KY 982 after an August 5, 2014, official order.

The route originates at a junction with U.S. Route 31E and US 150 (Bardstown Road) in Louisville, Kentucky. On the other side of intersection, KY 155 becomes a local road called Trevilian Way. KY 155 continues through several Louisville suburbs to Jeffersontown, Kentucky and into Spencer County, where it eventually merges with Kentucky Route 55 a few miles north of Taylorsville, Kentucky.\nIt is known locally as Taylorsville Road from its northern terminus until a junction with Kentucky Route 148 in Jefferson County, where it is known as Taylorsville Lake Road until reaching its southern terminus. Despite what its two local names would suggest, KY 155 itself does not actually reach either Taylorsville Lake or Taylorsville, but through connecting roads it is the primary non-interstate link between Louisville and both of those locations.\nIt is 4 to 6 lanes through much of Jefferson County, and is a major thoroughfare connecting Louisville's inner east side neighborhoods with suburban shopping and business areas, such as the Hurstbourne Parkway corridor. It interchanges with both I-264 and I-265.\n\nHistory\nKY 155's history is relatively lengthy, the intersection with Bardstown Road (once called the Bardstown Turnpike) was originally known as Doup's Point, the home of a major Louisville family. In 1848 legislation was passed authorizing the construction of a spur route from the Bardstown Turnpike near Doup's Point to Taylorsville, by way of Jeffersontown. The route, initially called the Louisville and Taylorsville Pike, was completed by the late 19th century and was expanded to 4 lanes in the 1960s. In the early 1990s, as a part of improvements to I-264 and its interchanges, KY 155 was widened to 6 lanes south of the interchange and local access roads were built parallel to it, to provide easier access for residents whose driveways had previously opened onto the highway.\n\nMajor intersections\nSee also\nRoads in Louisville, Kentucky\nPassage 8:\nKentucky Route 28\nKentucky Route 28 (KY 28) is a 36.217-mile-long (58.286 km) state highway in the U.S. state of Kentucky that travels from KY 11 and KY 30 in Booneville to KY 15 in northern rural Perry County via Cow Creek, Arnett, Buckhorn, and Chavies. KY 28 begins in Booneville by traveling concurrently with KY 30 east while KY 30 west travels through town to the northwest. KY 30 veers off at the official beginning of KY 28 at Mulberry Street. KY 28 heads out of Booneville in Owsley County, heading southeast. About 11 miles (18 km) southeast of Booneville, KY 28 enters Breathitt County. After about 6 miles (9.7 km) through Breathitt County, KY 28 enters Perry County. KY 28 passes through the community of Buckhorn before making a short reentry into Breathitt County.

The southern segment runs from Kentucky Routes 139 and 276 southeast of the unincorporated community of Lamasco to Kentucky Route 810, Kentucky Route 819, and Iuka Ferry Road northwest of \nKuttawa via Lamasco, Confederate, and Eddyville. The northern segment runs from Kentucky Route 917 and Short Drive just east of Iuka to Kentucky Route 453 in rural Livingston County several miles east of Iuka via Iuka. It appears that the two segments were originally or meant to be connected, as both segments are just a few miles apart. It appears that they were to connect at the Cumberland River, at which the northern segment ends on the western bank and a rural road, likely what was or is to be part of KY 93, ends on the east bank.\n\nHistory\nKY 93 previously ran from the Tennessee State line in Trigg County to Fredonia via Cadiz, Eddyville and Kuttawa. KY 93 north of Eddyville is now US 641, while the highway from the Lyon-Caldwell-Trigg County tripoint southward is now signed as KY 139. \nKY 93 was reassigned to US 62's old alignment west of Kuttawa to Iuka via the now-discontinued ferry service when US 62 was reallocated to a new alignment providing a more-direct route to Paducah in the mid-1950s.\n\nMajor intersections\nPassage 10:\nKentucky Route 1065\nKentucky Route 1065 (KY 1065) is a 13.856-mile-long (22.299 km) state highway located in Louisville, Kentucky.

As of the 2020 census, the population was 67,607. Its county seat is La Grange. The county is named for Colonel William Oldham.\nOldham County is part of the Louisville/Jefferson County, KY\u2013IN Metropolitan Statistical Area.\nOldham County is the wealthiest county in Kentucky and 47th-wealthiest county in the U.S. and ranks as the most educated county in Kentucky  While the causes for this are complicated, areas east of Louisville have long been popular with wealthy residents, initially as summer residences and eventually as year-round suburban estates and bedroom communities. Oldham County lies northeast of the best known of these areas, Anchorage, just outside Louisville's pre-merger East End.\n\nHistory\nOldham County was established on December 15, 1823, from parts of Henry, Jefferson, and Shelby Counties. It was the 74th Kentucky county, and was named in honor of Col. William Oldham of Jefferson County, a Revolutionary War officer.Initially, it was mainly a rural county with small, scattered developments in places like Westport which was founded in 1800 and served as the county seat early on. When the Louisville and Frankfort Railroad Company introduced rail lines in the area in the 1850s, many new towns and communities sprang up. Eventually the railroad ceased operating as a form of public transportation, but the more rural nature of the county continued to draw residents away from the metropolitan areas in Jefferson County. Since the early 1970s and the completion of Interstate 71, which connects Oldham County to Downtown Louisville and shopping in Eastern Jefferson County, Oldham County has increasingly become suburban in nature, a natural extension of Louisville's wealthy East End as it ran out of large tracts of undeveloped land.\n\nGeography\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the county has a total area of 196 square miles (510 km2), of which 187 square miles (480 km2) are land and 9.2 square miles (24 km2) (4.7%) are covered by water. It is the 13th-smallest county in Kentucky. The county's northern border with Indiana is formed by the Ohio River.\n\nAdjacent counties\nClark County, Indiana (northwest)\nTrimble County (northeast)\nHenry County (east)\nShelby County (southeast)\nJefferson County (southwest)\n\nDemographics\nAs of the census of 2000, there were 46,178 people, 14,856 households, and 12,196 families residing in the county. The population density was 244 per square mile (94/km2). There were 15,541 housing units at an average density of 82 per square mile (32/km2). The racial makeup of the county was 93.62% White, 4.21% Black or African American, 0.21% Native American, 0.44% Asian, 0.01% Pacific Islander, 0.55% from other races, and 0.97% from two or more races. 1.30% of the population were Hispanic or Latino of any race.\nThere were 14,856 households, out of which 44.10% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 71.50% were married couples living together, 7.80% had a female householder with no husband present, and 17.90% were non-families. 14.90% of all households were made up of individuals, and 4.80% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.85 and the average family size was 3.17.\nThe age distribution was 27.40% under the age of 18, 6.90% from 18 to 24, 33.10% from 25 to 44, 25.60% from 45 to 64, and 7.00% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 37 years. For every 100 females, there were 114.00 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 117.90 males.\nThe median income for a household in the county was $70,171 (2005), and the median income for a family was $70,495. Males had a median income of $46,962 versus $28,985 for females. The per capita income for the county was $25,374.  About 2.90% of families and 4.10% of the population were below the poverty line, including 4.50% of those under age 18 and 6.00% of those age 65 or over. Oldham County is the most affluent county in the state of Kentucky; most residents work in Louisville and choose to live in Oldham County due to the lack of crime and the nationally recognized school system. North Oldham High School in particular, is ranked very highly among state high schools, having been named a national blue ribbon school of excellence, and ranked in the top 250 best schools in the nation through US Weekly. 2006 classes at Oldham County High School were reported as to have a teacher:student ratio of 1:15, but that number does not accurately reflect the ratio of a normal class.  That number includes, for example, the small classes of five to six students in Behavioral Disorders.  The published ratio also includes small classes at the County Career Center, which is located on the same campus.  The actual teacher-student ratios are closer to 1:30. Regardless of population swelling and diminishing student-teacher ratios, which have led to a slight decline as of late, Oldham county is still widely recognized as the best public school system in the state.\n\nCommunities\nCities\nCensus-designated places\nBuckner\nWestport\n\nOther unincorporated places\nPolitics\nGovernment\nAt the federal level, Oldham County overlaps two congressional districts in the House of Representatives, the third district, represented by Democrat John Yarmuth, and the fourth district, represented by Republican Thomas Massie.\n\nNotable people\nD.

Despite what its two local names would suggest, KY 155 itself does not actually reach either Taylorsville Lake or Taylorsville, but through connecting roads it is the primary non-interstate link between Louisville and both of those locations.\nIt is 4 to 6 lanes through much of Jefferson County, and is a major thoroughfare connecting Louisville's inner east side neighborhoods with suburban shopping and business areas, such as the Hurstbourne Parkway corridor. It interchanges with both I-264 and I-265.\n\nHistory\nKY 155's history is relatively lengthy, the intersection with Bardstown Road (once called the Bardstown Turnpike) was originally known as Doup's Point, the home of a major Louisville family. In 1848 legislation was passed authorizing the construction of a spur route from the Bardstown Turnpike near Doup's Point to Taylorsville, by way of Jeffersontown. The route, initially called the Louisville and Taylorsville Pike, was completed by the late 19th century and was expanded to 4 lanes in the 1960s. In the early 1990s, as a part of improvements to I-264 and its interchanges, KY 155 was widened to 6 lanes south of the interchange and local access roads were built parallel to it, to provide easier access for residents whose driveways had previously opened onto the highway.\n\nMajor intersections\nSee also\nRoads in Louisville, Kentucky\nPassage 8:\nKentucky Route 28\nKentucky Route 28 (KY 28) is a 36.217-mile-long (58.286 km) state highway in the U.S. state of Kentucky that travels from KY 11 and KY 30 in Booneville to KY 15 in northern rural Perry County via Cow Creek, Arnett, Buckhorn, and Chavies. KY 28 begins in Booneville by traveling concurrently with KY 30 east while KY 30 west travels through town to the northwest. KY 30 veers off at the official beginning of KY 28 at Mulberry Street. KY 28 heads out of Booneville in Owsley County, heading southeast. About 11 miles (18 km) southeast of Booneville, KY 28 enters Breathitt County. After about 6 miles (9.7 km) through Breathitt County, KY 28 enters Perry County. KY 28 passes through the community of Buckhorn before making a short reentry into Breathitt County. After returning to Perry County, KY 28 passes through the community of Chavies before ending at KY 15 at Grapevine in Perry County.\n\nMajor intersections\nOwsley County + Breathitt County = 18.154\n\nSee also\n U.S. Roads portal\n United States portal\nPassage 9:\nKentucky Route 93\nKentucky Route 93 (KY 93) is a 27.734-mile (44.634 km) state highway in western Kentucky.\n\nRoute description\nThe route is separated into two segments. The southern segment runs from Kentucky Routes 139 and 276 southeast of the unincorporated community of Lamasco to Kentucky Route 810, Kentucky Route 819, and Iuka Ferry Road northwest of \nKuttawa via Lamasco, Confederate, and Eddyville. The northern segment runs from Kentucky Route 917 and Short Drive just east of Iuka to Kentucky Route 453 in rural Livingston County several miles east of Iuka via Iuka. It appears that the two segments were originally or meant to be connected, as both segments are just a few miles apart. It appears that they were to connect at the Cumberland River, at which the northern segment ends on the western bank and a rural road, likely what was or is to be part of KY 93, ends on the east bank.\n\nHistory\nKY 93 previously ran from the Tennessee State line in Trigg County to Fredonia via Cadiz, Eddyville and Kuttawa. KY 93 north of Eddyville is now US 641, while the highway from the Lyon-Caldwell-Trigg County tripoint southward is now signed as KY 139. \nKY 93 was reassigned to US 62's old alignment west of Kuttawa to Iuka via the now-discontinued ferry service when US 62 was reallocated to a new alignment providing a more-direct route to Paducah in the mid-1950s.\n\nMajor intersections\nPassage 10:\nKentucky Route 1065\nKentucky Route 1065 (KY 1065) is a 13.856-mile-long (22.299 km) state highway located in Louisville, Kentucky. The western terminus of the route is at Kentucky Route 907 a short distance west of Kentucky Route 841 (Gene Snyder Freeway) exit 6 in the Louisville neighborhood of Auburndale. The eastern terminus is at Kentucky Route 1819 in Fern Creek.\nThe route is known as the Outer Loop, Beulah Church Road, Seatonville Road, and Lovers Lane. It passes by what was the Louisville Motor Speedway and intersects Interstate 65 and the U.S. Route 31E/U.S. Route 150 concurrency.\n\nRoute description\nKY 1065 begins at an intersection with KY 907 in the Auburndale section of Louisville, heading east on two-lane undivided Outer Loop. The road crosses a CSX railroad line and heads between homes to the north and commercial establishments to the south. The route passes near shopping centers and comes to an intersection with KY 1865. KY 1065 continues through wooded areas with some nearby homes and commercial areas, reaching the KY 1020 junction. Past this, the route becomes a four-lane divided highway and heads through areas of businesses and industry, coming to a bridge over a CSX railroad line. The road passes through more industrial areas and heads to the south of a landfill as a four-lane undivided road before becoming a divided highway again as it comes to an interchange with I-65.  Past this interchange, KY 1065 passes near residential neighborhoods prior to reaching an intersection with KY 61 in a commercial area. The road continues east past several shopping centers and passes to the south of Jefferson Mall. The route heads through residential areas with some businesses and intersects the southern terminus of KY 2052.\n\nKY 1065 becomes a three-lane road with a center left-turn lane and heads east through more suburban development. The route curves northeast and intersects KY 864, at which point it turns southeast to form a concurrency with that route on Beulah Church Road. The road curves east, and KY 864 splits to the south. KY 1065 continues east on two-lane Beulah Church Road and passes through wooded residential neighborhoods, curving to the northeast. The route turns east and comes to an intersection with US 31E/US 150. Past this intersection, the road becomes Seatonville Road and heads east through more wooded areas of homes. KY 1065 turns east onto Lovers Lane and winds north and east through areas of fields and homes. The route continues north through more homes and woodland, coming to its eastern terminus at KY 1819.\n\nMajor intersections\nThe entire route is in Louisville, Jefferson County.\n\nSee also\nRoads in Louisville, Kentucky", "answers": ["Oldham County, Kentucky"], "length": 3650, "dataset": "hotpotqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "6ad3ed1320a952efd9df47137729d6f27f4fb720739dc5be", "pred": " Oldham County.

Amongst other motor racing events, it has hosted the German Grand Prix, most recently in 2019. The circuit has very little differences in elevation. The circuit has an FIA Grade 1 license.\n\nHistory\n1932\u20131938\nOriginally called \"Dreieckskurs\" (triangle course), the Hockenheimring was built in 1932. The man behind it is Ernst Christ, a young timekeeper who felt that a racing track should be built in his hometown of Hockenheim. He submitted the plans to the mayor and they were approved on Christmas day, in 1931. This first layout of the track was around twelve kilometres long and consisted of a large triangle-like section, a hairpin in the city and two straights connecting them.\n\n1938\u20131965\nIn 1938, the circuit dramatically shortened, from twelve kilometres down to just over seven and a half, and the Ostkurve corner, which lasted until 2001, was introduced for the first time.  In that year, the track was also renamed to \"Kurpfalzring\".  The track was damaged by tanks during World War II. After the war, the track was repaired, and renamed to \"Hockenheimring\". Former DKW and NSU factory rider and world record setter Wilhelm Herz became the manager of the track in 1954 and promoted the track successfully; Grand Prix motorcycle racing events were held, with the German motorcycle Grand Prix alternating between the Hockenheimring and other tracks.  This version of the circuit was just over seven and a half kilometres long and consisted of the original two long straights, with the Ostkurve in the forest and the original hairpin inside Hockenheim joining them together.\n\n1965\u20132001\nIn 1965, when the new Autobahn A 6 separated the village from the main part of the track, a new version of Hockenheim circuit was built, with the \"Motodrom\" stadium section, designed by John Hugenholtz, who also designed Suzuka. After Jim Clark was killed on 7 April 1968 in a Formula 2 racing accident, two fast chicanes were added and the track was lined with crash barriers in 1970. A small memorial was placed near the first chicane (which was named after him), at the site of his accident. In 1982, another chicane was added at the Ostkurve (east curve), after Patrick Depailler was killed there in 1980, and the first chicane was made slower as well. For the 1992 German Grand Prix, the Ostkurve was changed yet again, from a quick left turn into a more complex right-left-right chicane, after \u00c9rik Comas crashed there in 1991. The second chicane was renamed after Ayrton Senna, after his death at the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix.\nThis version used to be quite large, with a very long and very fast section going through forests essentially consisting of four straights of roughly 1.3 km (0.81 mi), separated by a chicane sequence, followed by a more tight and twisty \"stadium\" section (so called because of all the grandstands situated there) named Motodrom. This made the setting up of racing cars difficult, since a choice had to be made \u2013 whether to run low downforce to optimize speed through the straights and compromise grip in the stadium section, or vice versa. The long track length also meant that a typical Formula One race had only 45 laps, limiting the spectators' experience of the race to only that many passes through the stadium.\nDuring the mid-1980s \"turbo era\" of Formula One where fuel was restricted to either 220 (1984\u20131985), 195 (1986\u20131987) or 150 (1988) litres for races for the turbo powered cars, Hockenheim also saw drivers, including World Champion Alain Prost, at times fail to finish due to simply running out of fuel near the end of the race. Prost ran out at the end of the 1986 race, pushing his McLaren towards the line before giving up. He was placed 3rd when he ran dry and was eventually classified 6th, gaining a valuable championship point that would help him with his second World Championship.\n\nMany problems came to light during the 2000 German Grand Prix, which was won by Brazilian driver Rubens Barrichello from having started 18th on the grid. The race finished in changeable weather conditions, with pouring rain in the stadium sector and almost completely dry forest straights. All the overtaking moves that took place during the race were in the chicanes of the forest sector, meaning hardly any spectators saw most of the best action. Midway through the race, a former Mercedes-Benz employee, who had been dismissed, breached the track's security barriers on the first forest straight, showing vulnerable security facilities in the forest and leading to the deployment of the safety car that neutralized a comfortable lead for the two Mercedes-powered McLarens. Later on, French driver Jean Alesi collided with Brazilian Pedro Diniz in the braking zone for the third chicane and his car spun uncontrollably down the track, which caused him to suffer dizziness for three days.\nThese events prompted much protest from the FIA to greatly improve spectator viewing, safety, and security at the track, claiming that the track was no longer suited to modern Formula One racing.\n\n2002 redesign\nIn the early 2000s, F1 officials demanded the 6.823 km (4.240 mi) track be shortened and threatened to discontinue racing there, threatening to relocate to other tracks such as the EuroSpeedway Lausitz and sites in Asia. The state government of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg secured the financing for the redesign by Hermann Tilke for the 2002 German Grand Prix. The stadium section remained mostly intact, despite a new surface and a tighter Turn 1 (\"Nordkurve\"). However, the circuit was dramatically shortened, with the long, forested straights section chopped off in favour of more tight corners. More than half of the first straight and almost all of the straight between the Ostkurve and Senna chicane were cut and the rest was connected with a new long straight called the \"Parabolika\", with a small kink being added between the first straight and the new one. A small right-left-right complex was added to the remaining part of the final straight, with a new grandstand overlooking it. In an extremely controversial move, the old forest section was torn up and replanted with trees, eliminating any chance of using the old course either for future F1 events or for historic car events.\nThere was and still remains a great deal of criticism of the track redesign, in terms of ruining the previous unique technical challenges of the old Hockenheim circuit and delivering a new homogenised \"assembly line\" circuit without the character of the previous layout, whilst being beset by the perceived problems of other Tilke circuits. Several drivers and team principals, including Ron Dennis, Jarno Trulli and Juan Pablo Montoya, criticised the changes and stated their preference for the old circuit.The change in the track layout also saw the installation of a new memorial to Jim Clark. This is located at the outside of the current track's turn 2, where the old track continued out into the forests, and the new shortened track turns to the right.The new track has a seating capacity of 120,000, due to new large grandstands sponsored by Mercedes-Benz. The complex also features a quarter-mile track for drag racing. It hosts one of the largest drag racing events in Europe, known as the NitrOlympx, and was one of the last Top Fuel circuits to race to 0.25 miles (0.40 km) before the FIA switched the nitro categories to the now-recognised 1,000 feet (300 m) distance in 2012.\n\nFormula One\nThe Hockenheim Circuit hosted the German Grand Prix for the first time in 1970 when the F1 drivers decided at the French Grand Prix to boycott the allegedly dangerous N\u00fcrburgring unless major changes were made. The next year the German Grand Prix went back to the N\u00fcrburgring until the 1976 German Grand Prix. From 1977 to 2006, the Hockenheimring hosted the German Grand Prix with the exception of 1985, when the race was held at the reconfigured N\u00fcrburgring.\nIn July 2006, Bernie Ecclestone announced that from 2007 onwards, there would be only one Grand Prix per year in Germany. Since 1995, there had been two Grands Prix every year in Germany; the German Grand Prix at Hockenheim, plus either the European Grand Prix or the Luxembourg Grand Prix at the N\u00fcrburgring. From 2007, the N\u00fcrburgring and Hockenheimring alternated hosting the German Grand Prix, starting with the N\u00fcrburgring in 2007.\n\nOngoing deficits of the Formula One races, amounting to up to 5.3 million Euro per race that had to be covered by the local communities, made it likely the contract between the Hockenheimring and Formula One Management would not be extended after the Grand Prix of 2010. However, in October 2009 the contract for the circuit to hold the German GP was extended to 2018, with the FOA agreeing to cover any losses the event incurs. Neither Hockenheim nor the N\u00fcrburgring hosted a Grand Prix in 2015 or 2017 after the N\u00fcrburgring failed to complete an agreement with Formula 1's commercial rights holder Bernie Ecclestone.\n\nDrag racing (NitrolympX \u2013 Rico Anthes Quartermile)\nFrom 1986 to 1988, the start\u2013finish straight was used for 1/8 mile drag racing. In 1989, a proper drag strip was built by connecting the Opel-Kurve and the first turn entering the Motodrom section. The finish line was at the beginning of the forest, with a very long run-off on the straight in the forest. Competitors had to travel around the full race track in opposite direction to return to the paddock.\nThe drag strip is only used for two events in August, the Public Race Days and the NitrolympX main event a week later. Originally named the Nitrolympics and featuring Top Fuel dragsters, it was renamed to NitrolympX.\nWhen the Hockenheimring was shortened in 2002, the drag strip was moved back, closer to the new tall Tower stands that allow an unusual view along the drag strip. Even though the run off was cut in half it remains one of the longest in drag racing. The NitrolympX usually host most European Drag Racing Championship, sanctioned by FIA or FIM, plus jet dragsters and other entertaining events on the Saturday night show that draws 40,000 spectators.The drag strip in 2008 was christened Rico Anthes Quartermile after the German former Top Fuel driver and long-time organizer of the NitrolympX had retired in 2007. As the dragstrip can only be prepared for professional drag racing after the last major circuit event, mainly the Formula One race, the grip is often sub par compared to permanent drag strips that host two Euro Championship events each year, like Santa Pod Raceway in England or Tierp Arena in Sweden. The best performances on the full quarter-mile were significantly below those in Santa Pod, and the best ET was set in 2005: 4.873 sec. and 458 km/h by Brady Kalivoda (USA).In 2012, some Pro classes could not find traction as Formula One had demanded a new surface. In subsequent years, the organizers provided a better track, with support from Santa Pod personnel and machinery. In 2016, Hockenheim, and mainland Europe, finally saw the first 3-second Top Fuel 1000 ft passes, with 3.939 sec. and 486.91 km/h by Anita M\u00e4kel\u00e4 (FIN). An overall European record for Super Street Bike was set by Garry Bowe (GB) with 7.04s 340,69 km/h.\n\nDTM\nThe DTM (Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters) series has regularly raced at the Hockenheimring since its revival in 2000. In most years, the DTM has competed there twice during a season.\n\nRallycross\nLocated in the stadia section of the track, the rallycross track uses a section of track from turns 11 to 16, combined with a dirt section in front of the grandstands. It hosted first ever World RX of Hockenheim, round 2 of FIA World Rallycross Championship in 2015 as supporting event of DTM. WRX also combined with the DTM for an event there in 2017.\n\nLayout history\nCurrent circuit configurations\nPrevious configurations\nLap records\nOfficial record lap times are only set during the race. The fastest ever lap on the track is 1:11.212 set by Sebastian Vettel in a Ferrari SF71H during qualifying at the 2018 German Grand Prix.

Amongst other motor racing events, it has hosted the German Grand Prix, most recently in 2019. The circuit has very little differences in elevation. The circuit has an FIA Grade 1 license.\n\nHistory\n1932\u20131938\nOriginally called \"Dreieckskurs\" (triangle course), the Hockenheimring was built in 1932. The man behind it is Ernst Christ, a young timekeeper who felt that a racing track should be built in his hometown of Hockenheim. He submitted the plans to the mayor and they were approved on Christmas day, in 1931. This first layout of the track was around twelve kilometres long and consisted of a large triangle-like section, a hairpin in the city and two straights connecting them.\n\n1938\u20131965\nIn 1938, the circuit dramatically shortened, from twelve kilometres down to just over seven and a half, and the Ostkurve corner, which lasted until 2001, was introduced for the first time.  In that year, the track was also renamed to \"Kurpfalzring\".  The track was damaged by tanks during World War II. After the war, the track was repaired, and renamed to \"Hockenheimring\". Former DKW and NSU factory rider and world record setter Wilhelm Herz became the manager of the track in 1954 and promoted the track successfully; Grand Prix motorcycle racing events were held, with the German motorcycle Grand Prix alternating between the Hockenheimring and other tracks.  This version of the circuit was just over seven and a half kilometres long and consisted of the original two long straights, with the Ostkurve in the forest and the original hairpin inside Hockenheim joining them together.\n\n1965\u20132001\nIn 1965, when the new Autobahn A 6 separated the village from the main part of the track, a new version of Hockenheim circuit was built, with the \"Motodrom\" stadium section, designed by John Hugenholtz, who also designed Suzuka. After Jim Clark was killed on 7 April 1968 in a Formula 2 racing accident, two fast chicanes were added and the track was lined with crash barriers in 1970. A small memorial was placed near the first chicane (which was named after him), at the site of his accident. In 1982, another chicane was added at the Ostkurve (east curve), after Patrick Depailler was killed there in 1980, and the first chicane was made slower as well. For the 1992 German Grand Prix, the Ostkurve was changed yet again, from a quick left turn into a more complex right-left-right chicane, after \u00c9rik Comas crashed there in 1991. The second chicane was renamed after Ayrton Senna, after his death at the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix.\nThis version used to be quite large, with a very long and very fast section going through forests essentially consisting of four straights of roughly 1.3 km (0.81 mi), separated by a chicane sequence, followed by a more tight and twisty \"stadium\" section (so called because of all the grandstands situated there) named Motodrom. This made the setting up of racing cars difficult, since a choice had to be made \u2013 whether to run low downforce to optimize speed through the straights and compromise grip in the stadium section, or vice versa. The long track length also meant that a typical Formula One race had only 45 laps, limiting the spectators' experience of the race to only that many passes through the stadium.\nDuring the mid-1980s \"turbo era\" of Formula One where fuel was restricted to either 220 (1984\u20131985), 195 (1986\u20131987) or 150 (1988) litres for races for the turbo powered cars, Hockenheim also saw drivers, including World Champion Alain Prost, at times fail to finish due to simply running out of fuel near the end of the race. Prost ran out at the end of the 1986 race, pushing his McLaren towards the line before giving up. He was placed 3rd when he ran dry and was eventually classified 6th, gaining a valuable championship point that would help him with his second World Championship.\n\nMany problems came to light during the 2000 German Grand Prix, which was won by Brazilian driver Rubens Barrichello from having started 18th on the grid. The race finished in changeable weather conditions, with pouring rain in the stadium sector and almost completely dry forest straights. All the overtaking moves that took place during the race were in the chicanes of the forest sector, meaning hardly any spectators saw most of the best action. Midway through the race, a former Mercedes-Benz employee, who had been dismissed, breached the track's security barriers on the first forest straight, showing vulnerable security facilities in the forest and leading to the deployment of the safety car that neutralized a comfortable lead for the two Mercedes-powered McLarens. Later on, French driver Jean Alesi collided with Brazilian Pedro Diniz in the braking zone for the third chicane and his car spun uncontrollably down the track, which caused him to suffer dizziness for three days.\nThese events prompted much protest from the FIA to greatly improve spectator viewing, safety, and security at the track, claiming that the track was no longer suited to modern Formula One racing.\n\n2002 redesign\nIn the early 2000s, F1 officials demanded the 6.823 km (4.240 mi) track be shortened and threatened to discontinue racing there, threatening to relocate to other tracks such as the EuroSpeedway Lausitz and sites in Asia. The state government of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg secured the financing for the redesign by Hermann Tilke for the 2002 German Grand Prix. The stadium section remained mostly intact, despite a new surface and a tighter Turn 1 (\"Nordkurve\"). However, the circuit was dramatically shortened, with the long, forested straights section chopped off in favour of more tight corners. More than half of the first straight and almost all of the straight between the Ostkurve and Senna chicane were cut and the rest was connected with a new long straight called the \"Parabolika\", with a small kink being added between the first straight and the new one. A small right-left-right complex was added to the remaining part of the final straight, with a new grandstand overlooking it. In an extremely controversial move, the old forest section was torn up and replanted with trees, eliminating any chance of using the old course either for future F1 events or for historic car events.\nThere was and still remains a great deal of criticism of the track redesign, in terms of ruining the previous unique technical challenges of the old Hockenheim circuit and delivering a new homogenised \"assembly line\" circuit without the character of the previous layout, whilst being beset by the perceived problems of other Tilke circuits. Several drivers and team principals, including Ron Dennis, Jarno Trulli and Juan Pablo Montoya, criticised the changes and stated their preference for the old circuit.The change in the track layout also saw the installation of a new memorial to Jim Clark. This is located at the outside of the current track's turn 2, where the old track continued out into the forests, and the new shortened track turns to the right.The new track has a seating capacity of 120,000, due to new large grandstands sponsored by Mercedes-Benz. The complex also features a quarter-mile track for drag racing. It hosts one of the largest drag racing events in Europe, known as the NitrOlympx, and was one of the last Top Fuel circuits to race to 0.25 miles (0.40 km) before the FIA switched the nitro categories to the now-recognised 1,000 feet (300 m) distance in 2012.\n\nFormula One\nThe Hockenheim Circuit hosted the German Grand Prix for the first time in 1970 when the F1 drivers decided at the French Grand Prix to boycott the allegedly dangerous N\u00fcrburgring unless major changes were made. The next year the German Grand Prix went back to the N\u00fcrburgring until the 1976 German Grand Prix. From 1977 to 2006, the Hockenheimring hosted the German Grand Prix with the exception of 1985, when the race was held at the reconfigured N\u00fcrburgring.\nIn July 2006, Bernie Ecclestone announced that from 2007 onwards, there would be only one Grand Prix per year in Germany. Since 1995, there had been two Grands Prix every year in Germany; the German Grand Prix at Hockenheim, plus either the European Grand Prix or the Luxembourg Grand Prix at the N\u00fcrburgring. From 2007, the N\u00fcrburgring and Hockenheimring alternated hosting the German Grand Prix, starting with the N\u00fcrburgring in 2007.\n\nOngoing deficits of the Formula One races, amounting to up to 5.3 million Euro per race that had to be covered by the local communities, made it likely the contract between the Hockenheimring and Formula One Management would not be extended after the Grand Prix of 2010. However, in October 2009 the contract for the circuit to hold the German GP was extended to 2018, with the FOA agreeing to cover any losses the event incurs. Neither Hockenheim nor the N\u00fcrburgring hosted a Grand Prix in 2015 or 2017 after the N\u00fcrburgring failed to complete an agreement with Formula 1's commercial rights holder Bernie Ecclestone.\n\nDrag racing (NitrolympX \u2013 Rico Anthes Quartermile)\nFrom 1986 to 1988, the start\u2013finish straight was used for 1/8 mile drag racing. In 1989, a proper drag strip was built by connecting the Opel-Kurve and the first turn entering the Motodrom section. The finish line was at the beginning of the forest, with a very long run-off on the straight in the forest. Competitors had to travel around the full race track in opposite direction to return to the paddock.\nThe drag strip is only used for two events in August, the Public Race Days and the NitrolympX main event a week later. Originally named the Nitrolympics and featuring Top Fuel dragsters, it was renamed to NitrolympX.\nWhen the Hockenheimring was shortened in 2002, the drag strip was moved back, closer to the new tall Tower stands that allow an unusual view along the drag strip. Even though the run off was cut in half it remains one of the longest in drag racing. The NitrolympX usually host most European Drag Racing Championship, sanctioned by FIA or FIM, plus jet dragsters and other entertaining events on the Saturday night show that draws 40,000 spectators.The drag strip in 2008 was christened Rico Anthes Quartermile after the German former Top Fuel driver and long-time organizer of the NitrolympX had retired in 2007. As the dragstrip can only be prepared for professional drag racing after the last major circuit event, mainly the Formula One race, the grip is often sub par compared to permanent drag strips that host two Euro Championship events each year, like Santa Pod Raceway in England or Tierp Arena in Sweden. The best performances on the full quarter-mile were significantly below those in Santa Pod, and the best ET was set in 2005: 4.873 sec. and 458 km/h by Brady Kalivoda (USA).In 2012, some Pro classes could not find traction as Formula One had demanded a new surface. In subsequent years, the organizers provided a better track, with support from Santa Pod personnel and machinery. In 2016, Hockenheim, and mainland Europe, finally saw the first 3-second Top Fuel 1000 ft passes, with 3.939 sec. and 486.91 km/h by Anita M\u00e4kel\u00e4 (FIN). An overall European record for Super Street Bike was set by Garry Bowe (GB) with 7.04s 340,69 km/h.\n\nDTM\nThe DTM (Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters) series has regularly raced at the Hockenheimring since its revival in 2000. In most years, the DTM has competed there twice during a season.\n\nRallycross\nLocated in the stadia section of the track, the rallycross track uses a section of track from turns 11 to 16, combined with a dirt section in front of the grandstands. It hosted first ever World RX of Hockenheim, round 2 of FIA World Rallycross Championship in 2015 as supporting event of DTM. WRX also combined with the DTM for an event there in 2017.\n\nLayout history\nCurrent circuit configurations\nPrevious configurations\nLap records\nOfficial record lap times are only set during the race. The fastest ever lap on the track is 1:11.212 set by Sebastian Vettel in a Ferrari SF71H during qualifying at the 2018 German Grand Prix.
