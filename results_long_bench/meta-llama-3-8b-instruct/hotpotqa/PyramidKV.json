Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\nLake Ercina\nLake Ercina is a small highland lake in Asturias, Spain. It is located in the Picos de Europa, in the Cantabrian Mountains. Situated next to Lake Enol, together, they forms the group known as Lakes of Covadonga within the Picos de Europa National Park. Lake Ercina is smaller than Lake Enol. It is situated at an altitude of 1,108 metres (3,635 ft) and its maximum depth is just over 2 metres (6 ft 7 in). The eutrophic lake covers approximately 8 hectares (20 acres). Its characteristics are tied to its glacier origin and geographic location.\nPassage 2:\nCu\u00f1aba\nCu\u00f1aba is one of eight parishes (administrative divisions) in Pe\u00f1amellera Baja, a municipality within the province and autonomous community of Asturias, in northern Spain. It is located in the Picos de Europa National Park.\nThe population is 47 (INE 2011).\nPassage 3:\nLake Enol\nLake Enol is a small highland lake in the Principality of Asturias, Spain. It is located in the Picos de Europa Western Massif, Cantabrian Mountains. It is next to Lake Ercina and together, they form the group known as Lakes of Covadonga, inside the Picos de Europa National Park. Lake Enol is the larger of the two. It is situated approximately 10 km from Covadonga and 25 km from Cangas de On\u00eds. A curving road is available from Arriondas to the lake. Measuring 0.1 square kilometres (0.039 sq mi), it is one of the biggest lakes in the area. Lake Enol is situated 1,070 metres (3,510 ft) above sea level, in the Picos de Europa). It was formed by the withdrawal of a front glacier.\n\nCulture\nA submerged image of the Virgin Mary is elevated every year on 8 September and then taken out for a procession. Regional dancing occurs at Lake Enol during the Fiesta del Pastor on 25 July.\nPassage 4:\nTrescares\nTrescares is one of eight parishes (administrative divisions) in Pe\u00f1amellera Alta, a municipality within the province and autonomous community of Asturias, in northern Spain. It is located in the Picos de Europa National Park.\nThe population is 55 (INE 2007).\nIn this village, there are two of the most important buildings of this autonomy: the church and, the most important, La Vidre bridge (El Puente La Vidre), built in the romanic time over another bridge that was constructed by the Romans. Today's bridge is known worldwide, and so, a lot of spots are made in it.\nHere it pass one of the most important rivers of Asturias, the Cares river (El R\u00edo Cares), which ends in the river Deva that separates the community of Asturias and Cantabria. One of the sports more played is the fishing,\nLike another village, Trescares has its feast: Saint Fausto.  This is celebrated on the following Saturday of The Pilar (national feast), in which the Trescares people wear asturian dresses and offer a two metres high bouquet to the Saint.\nPassage 5:\nTimanfaya National Park\nTimanfaya National Park (Spanish: Parque Nacional de Timanfaya) is a Spanish national park in the southwestern part of the island of Lanzarote, in the Canary Islands. It covers parts of the municipalities Tinajo and Yaiza. The area is 51.07 square kilometres (19.72 sq mi), and the parkland is entirely made up of volcanic soil.\nThe statue El Diablo by C\u00e9sar Manrique is its symbol.\nIt is the only National Park in Spain which is entirely geological. Timanfaya National Park represents a sign of recent and historical volcanism in the Macaronesian Region. The last volcanic eruptions occurred during the 18th century as well as on the 19th century.\n\nVolcanic activity\nThe greatest recorded eruptions occurred between 1730 and 1736. The volcanic activity continues as the surface temperature in the core ranges from 100 to 600 \u00b0C (212 to 1,112 \u00b0F) at the depth of 13 metres (43 ft), which is demonstrated by pouring water into the ground, resulting in a geyser of steam which is an attraction for tourists. There is only one active volcano, Timanfaya volcano, after which the park is named.\n\nEcological value\nIn 1993, UNESCO designated a Biosphere reserve covering the whole of Lanzarote. The national park is one of the core areas of the biosphere reserve.\nAccess to the park by the public is strictly regulated to protect the delicate flora and fauna. There are one or two footpaths, and a popular short route where one can visit by camel. There is a public car park from which one can tour the volcanic landscape by coach using a road that is otherwise closed to the public.\nPassage 6:\nLakes of Covadonga\nThe Lakes of Covadonga (el. 1134 m.) are composed of two glacial lakes located on the region of Asturias, Spain. These lakes, often also called Lakes of Enol or simply Los Lagos, are Lake Enol and Lake Ercina located in the Picos de Europa range and they are the original center of the Picos de Europa National Park, created in 1918. They are near Covadonga Sanctuary.\n\nVuelta a Espa\u00f1a\nThe road ascending from Covadonga to the lakes is a popular climb in professional road bicycle racing, having been used by Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a many times in the last 25 years.\nTogether with Alto de l'Angliru, Lagos de Covadonga is the most important climb in the modern history of the Vuelta. The road that leads to the lakes starts at Covadonga and is 12.6 kilometres long at an average gradient of 7.3% (height gain: 1056 m).[1] The most demanding section is La Huesera, 7 kilometres from the top of the climb, with an average gradient of 15% during 800 meters. It was featured for the first time in 1983 with the victory of Marino Lejarreta, who was in a fierce battle with Bernard Hinault for overall victory. This was the same Vuelta that saw Hinault, Greg LeMond and Laurent Fignon all riding on the same team.  Stage 7 of the 2023 La Vuelta Femenina ended at Lagos de Covadonga, with Dutch cyclist Demi Vollering placing first.\n\nWinners of the Lakes of Covadonga stage - Men\nWinners of the Lakes of Covadonga stage - Women\nExternal links\nLagos de Covadonga climb details (in Spanish)\nInformation and profile of the Covadonga by Climbbybike.com\nCycling up to Lagos de Covadonga: data, profile, map, photos and description\nPassage 7:\nTobes\nTobes is one of eight parishes (administrative divisions) in Pe\u00f1amellera Baja, a municipality within the province and autonomous community of Asturias, in northern Spain. It is located in the Picos de Europa National Park.\nThe population is 123 (INE 2011).\nPassage 8:\nPicos de Europa National Park\nThe Picos de Europa National Park (Spanish: Parque Nacional de Picos de Europa) is a National Park in the Picos de Europa mountain range, in northern Spain. It is within the boundaries of three autonomous communities, Asturias, Cantabria and Castile and Le\u00f3n, which are represented on the body which runs the park. The park is also a popular destination for hikers and trekkers.\n\nHistory\nIt was the first of the National Parks of Spain. When it was created 22 July 1918 with help from Pedro Pidal, 1st Marquess of Villaviciosa de Asturias, it covered the western part of today's national park, centered on the Lakes of Covadonga.\nThe Parque Nacional de la Monta\u00f1a de Covadonga, as it then was called, had an area of 169.25 km\u00b2. On 30 May 1995 and then on 3 December 2014, the park was extended to include its current total area of 671.27 km\u00b2.\nOn 9 July 2003, UNESCO approved Biosphere Reserve status for the National Park.  Picos de Europa is one of several biosphere reserves in the Cantabrian Mountains which are being integrated into a single super-reserve to be known as \"Gran Cant\u00e1brica\".\n\nGeography\nThe total area of the park is 671 km\u00b2 and is shared by  Castilla y Le\u00f3n, Asturias, and Cantabria. The highest point of the park is in Torre de Cerredo peak,  2,648 m AMSL and the lowest point is 75 m AMSL in the Deva River, that is, a vertical drop of 2,573 m.\nThe geological features of the park show the effects of glacial erosion on the limestone massifs that form the Cantabrian Mountains.\nThe human population is about 1300.Vega de Liordes, an enclave in the Le\u00f3n sector of Picos de Europa belonging to the municipality of Posada de Valde\u00f3n registered \u221235.8 \u00b0C (\u221232.4 \u00b0F), a record low temperature, on January 7, 2021.\n\nFlora and fauna\nSeveral types of woods can be found in the area; trees include beeches and Cantabrian Holm Oaks.\nThere are many protected animal species, like the Cantabrian capercaillie (Tetrao urogallus cantabricus), the Bearded vulture (Gypaetus barbatus), the Cantabrian brown bear and the Iberian wolf (Canis lupus signatus). The most representative animal of the Picos de Europa is the Cantabrian chamois (Rupicapra pyrenaica parva) or rebeco, of which there are many sculptures around the park.\n\nSee also\nRedes Natural Park\nSan Glorio\nFlora of Cantabria\nPassage 9:\nNaranjo de Bulnes\nThe Naranjo de Bulnes (known as Picu Urriellu in Asturian) is a limestone peak dating from the Paleozoic Era, located in the Macizo Central region of the Picos de Europa, Asturias (Spain). Its name Picu Urriellu is believed to be derived from the term Los Urrieles, which is used to describe the Macizo Central. Naranjo de Bulnes is part of the Cabrales region of Asturias, and lies within the Picos de Europa National Park.\nThe first written reference to \"Picu Urriellu\" as \"Naranjo de Bulnes\" is credited to the German geologist and engineer, Wilhelm Schulz, who, in 1855, published the first topographic and geological map of Asturias. As far as is known the etymology of this name is not clear, because, historically, the local inhabitants always referred to the mountain as \"Picu Urriellu\". It has been suggested that the name can be attributed to the orange hue of the limestone from which the peak is formed. The local residents of Bulnes have a saying concerning the contentious name: \"No me llameis Naranjo, pues fruto no puedo dar, llamadme Picu Urriellu que es mi nombre natural\". (Don't call me Orange tree, because fruit I cannot bear, call me Picu Urriellu which is my natural name).\nIt has an altitude of 2,529 metres and although it is by no means the highest peak of the Cantabrian mountain range, it can be considered the best-known summit in the world of Spanish mountaineering, especially the 550m high vertical wall of the west face for big wall climbing. At its foot lies Vega Urriellu, a glacial valley from the quaternary period.\n\nHistoric ascents\nThis mountain was first scaled via the north face (by the route now known as the V\u00eda Pidal) on 5 August 1904 by Pedro Pidal, 1st Marquess of Villaviciosa de Asturias, accompanied by the shepherd Gregorio Perez, called \"El Cainejo\" based on his place of birth, Ca\u00edn in Le\u00f3n.The German geology professor and expert mountain climber Gustav Schulze made the second ascent of Urriellu on 1 October 1906, also via the north face, making him the first man to make the climb solo. He was also the first to use climbing pins to rappel down the south face. Accustomed to the large cliffs of the Alps and the Dolomites, Schulze described the climb as short and difficult.\nUsing the same face and route as Pidal, Victor Mart\u00ednez Campillo, a local of the nearby town of Bulnes, made the ascent on 31 August 1916. On this climb, Campillo recovered parts of the rope that Pidal and Perez had left attached to the rock during their descent from the peak. He made the same climb again on 22 September 1923, and on 19 August 1924, also opened a more gentle route, located to the left of the south face and now known as V\u00eda Victor.\nOn 7 July 1928, the mountaineer Andr\u00e9s Espinosa from Biscay scaled the south face alone without ropes. This was only the second climb of this kind on the mountain and the first at a national standard.\nOne month later, on 8 August, Manuel Martinez Campillo (a cousin of Victor) opened a new path known as the Horizontal Pass. This route was created to the right of the south face and has since become one of the most used routes.\nOn 13 August 1944, two sons of Victor Mart\u00ednez, Alfonso and Juan, opened the route on the south face known as the \"V\u00eda Sur\", or the \"Mart\u00ednez Direct Line\", which is one of the most used and safest routes.\nOn 23 March 1954, Antonio Moreno, Rafael Pell\u00fas, M\u00e1ximo Serna and Agust\u00edn Faus from the Pe\u00f1alara High Mountain Group tried to make the first winter climb. This attempt was called off due to the threat of avalanches. On 8 March 1956, \u00c1ngel Landa Bidarte from the Baracaldo Alpine tourism group and Pedro Udaondo from the Bilbao Juventus mountain group were the first to succeed in reaching the summit in winter conditions.\nOn 21 August 1962, the Aragonese mountaineers Alberto Rabad\u00e1 and Ernesto Navarro completed the first ascent via the difficult West Face.\nOn 8 February 1973, two parties, one formed by Miguel \u00c1ngel Garc\u00eda Gallego (from Murcia) and Jos\u00e9 \u00c1ngel Lucas, and the other formed by C\u00e9sar P\u00e9rez de Tudela and Pedro Antonio Ortega (from Ardilla), made the first winter climb using the \"V\u00eda Rabad\u00e1 y Navarro\" on the West Face. This ascent was followed closely by the media as that winter had already claimed several lives and a few spectacular rescues had been required.\nOn 4 September 2009, the brothers Iker and Eneko Pou conquered Urriellu in 8 hours via the Orbayu route, a path with one of the most difficult cliff faces in the world with a gradient of 8c+/9a.\nThe \"Pand\u00e9bano Col\" can also be reached from the town of Bulnes; however, this town can only be reached using a footpath or the Funicula railway. Although the most direct way of getting to the \"Vega Urriellu\" from Bulnes would be along the Balcos\u00edn channel and the \"Majada de Camburero\", this path is more difficult.\n\nClimbing routes\nA list of the most important routes (most of which are for big wall climbing):\nWest Face\n-Rabad\u00e1 y Navarro (750m, MD+, 6a, A1 [6c+])\n-Leiva.

On 8 March 1956, \u00c1ngel Landa Bidarte from the Baracaldo Alpine tourism group and Pedro Udaondo from the Bilbao Juventus mountain group were the first to succeed in reaching the summit in winter conditions.\nOn 21 August 1962, the Aragonese mountaineers Alberto Rabad\u00e1 and Ernesto Navarro completed the first ascent via the difficult West Face.\nOn 8 February 1973, two parties, one formed by Miguel \u00c1ngel Garc\u00eda Gallego (from Murcia) and Jos\u00e9 \u00c1ngel Lucas, and the other formed by C\u00e9sar P\u00e9rez de Tudela and Pedro Antonio Ortega (from Ardilla), made the first winter climb using the \"V\u00eda Rabad\u00e1 y Navarro\" on the West Face. This ascent was followed closely by the media as that winter had already claimed several lives and a few spectacular rescues had been required.\nOn 4 September 2009, the brothers Iker and Eneko Pou conquered Urriellu in 8 hours via the Orbayu route, a path with one of the most difficult cliff faces in the world with a gradient of 8c+/9a.\nThe \"Pand\u00e9bano Col\" can also be reached from the town of Bulnes; however, this town can only be reached using a footpath or the Funicula railway. Although the most direct way of getting to the \"Vega Urriellu\" from Bulnes would be along the Balcos\u00edn channel and the \"Majada de Camburero\", this path is more difficult.\n\nClimbing routes\nA list of the most important routes (most of which are for big wall climbing):\nWest Face\n-Rabad\u00e1 y Navarro (750m, MD+, 6a, A1 [6c+])\n-Leiva.
