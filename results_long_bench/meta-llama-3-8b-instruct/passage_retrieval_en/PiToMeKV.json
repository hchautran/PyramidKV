{"prompt": "Here are 30 paragraphs from Wikipedia, along with an abstract. Please determine which paragraph the abstract is from.\n\nParagraph 1: The story opens with an unknown narrator addressing a letter to someone referred to as \"V\". The narrator writes his letter from New York having obtained \"V\" 's address from a mutual acquaintance, Gleb Alexandrovich Gekko, who finds \"V\"'s writings to be anti-nationalist. Both \"V\" and the narrator are revealed to be Russian born immigrants who spent time together in France and the narrator recalls his literary excursions with \"V\" but admits he is no longer a poet. The narrator explains that after \"V\"'s departure from France he married a much younger woman. Although the narrator states he has papers to prove matrimony he is certain his wife was not a real entity and he is therefore \"...able to speak of her with as much detachment as I would of a character in a story...\" Due to the narrator's published criticism of Germany he admits attempting to expatriate from occupied France using his wife's relatives in New York but they never responded. Through other contacts, the narrator reveals he was able secure passage towards Paris to await the necessary papers for full departure to the United States. The narrator and his wife depart and travel by train across the country, spending their honeymoon witnessing refugees and destitution. During this period the narrator's wife laments what conditions their dog would have to endure should they have bought a dog and left that dog behind to face its own death. Traveling to Nice by railway the narrator is separated from his wife when he briefly departs at a stop for food, having both tickets with him. Unable to locate his wife the narrator decides to travel to the following stop in Montpellier sending telegrams for her hoping he will find her having traveled ahead to their destination. After arriving in Nice the narrator receives little help from police as he reflects on his misfortune in comparison to the stories he hears concerning people of Jewish descent from his fellow Russian immigrants. A week passes and the narrator discovers his wife by chance at a nearby market. His wife explains she sought help from the Commissariat and a few elderly women refugees who provided the means to reach her and her husband's destination. Soon after the wife changes her story during an intimate moment to reveal she spent her time with another man in Montpellier with whom she had relations with. The narrator demands to be given every detail of her memories during the days that follow while awaiting paperwork that will allow for escape from the country. His wife states while upset that it is possible she did not do it, it is possible that she did it to test him, and it is possible there is a multiplicity in her experience.\n\nParagraph 2: Nas also attacks Jay-Z's street cred, claiming, \"In '88, you was gettin' chased to your buildin'/ Callin' my crib, and I ain't even give you my numbers/ All I did was give you a style for you to run with.\" He also accuses Jay of selling out, \"Y'all niggas deal with emotions like bitches/ What's sad is I love you cause you're my brother, you traded your soul for riches.\" Nas also criticized him for copying KRS-One ideas on the name of Jay-Z's current album at the time, The Blueprint, which was quite similar to the Boogie-Down Production's album, Ghetto Music: The Blueprint of Hip Hop, with the line \"KRS already made an album called Blueprint.\" He had lines calling Jay unattractive and accusing him of misogyny, as well as having an affair with Foxy Brown in the late 1990s (which she would confirm years later in her track \"Let em Know\") rapping, \"You seem to be only concerned with dissin' women/ Were you abused as a child, scared to smile, they called you ugly?\" and \"Foxy kept you hot, kept your face in her puss/ What you think you gettin' girls now because of your looks?\", \"started cocking up my weapon slowly loading up this ammo to explode it on a Camel and his soldiers I can handle \". He also accuses Jay of brown nosing other rappers for fame: \"Your ass went from Jaz to hangin' with Kane, to Irv to Big/ And, Eminem murdered you on your own shit.\" Not only does he criticize the usage of other rappers' influence for increased fame, he mentions that Eminem outshined him on his song, \"Renegade\". Finally, Nas insults Jay-Z's biting of Big's lyrics claiming that Jay-Z stole his rhyming skills off Biggie, \"How much of Biggie's rhymes gonna come out your fat lips?\". The intro of Ether starts with gunshots from Notorious B.I.G.'s \"Who Shot Ya?\", immediately followed by a screwed voice of 2Pac saying \"Fuck Jay-Z\", originally taken from the song \"Fuck Friendz\". In the outro of \"Ether\", Nas mocks the chorus of \"Takeover\", which Jay-Z raps \"R-O-C, we runnin' this rap shit\", Nas changes it to \"R-O-C, get gunned up and clapped quick\" and so on.\n\nParagraph 3: Each of the three main areas of the game has four levels, three of them contain pieces of that area's Fairy Spirit Stone, and the fourth a Castle where that area's king is imprisoned. Each king has the power to put their areas stone back together. In order to reach the Devil all three stones must be repaired. The game for most levels is a standard platform game with jumping and shooting. There are four other levels that are played in different ways. (1) Meet and ride in the pouch of a Kangaroo-like Dinosaur. (2) Race a car in an under water course. (3) Ride on the back of a bird-like dragon that can shoot balls of fire, as enemies fall from the top of the screen. (4) Fly using a hat that has a spinning propeller on its top. The main character that is being used to play can be switched by pausing the game and selecting another character, each has their own unique abilities, a sixth character the princess Corona, whose name also means sun's outer layer Corona, can also be unlocked as a playable character once the game has been beaten. Small voice clips from the cartoon actors can be heard when starting any of the levels or when the character is defeated. Many of the boss enemies come from other cultures such as a Minotaur, Harpy, Centaur, and an evil version of Santa Claus. As the demo story plays a Pentagram is seen as the Devil is released form is barrier. The text of the game is entirely in Japanese and appears in a window bar at the bottom of the screen along with an image of the person that it speaking, the image changes when the person is happy, sad, or another person is talking.\n\nParagraph 4: He was educated at Eduardo Mondlane University (Diploma in Development Studies), the University of East Anglia (Diploma in Development Economics, 1991, and MA Industrial Development, 1992), the University of Oxford (MSc Development Economics, 1997) and SOAS, University of London (PhD Economics, 2002). He was an associate professor in industrialization and development economics at Eduardo Mondlane University, from 1992 to 2019, when he retired, was the director of the Instituto de Estudos Sociais e Econ\u00f3micos (Institute for Social and Economic Studies) (IESE) from 2007 to 2012, and coordinator of IESE's research group on economics and development, from 2007 to 2017. He is, currently, a visiting professor at the Lisbon School of Economics and Management, ISEG, of the University of Lisbon (https://www.iseg.ulisboa.pt), and a researcher of ISEG's Centre for African and Development Studies, CEsA (https://web.archive.org/web/20180213201026/http://pascal.iseg.utl.pt/~cesa/). His research is focused on the political economy of economic crisis and transformation and systems of capital accumulation in Africa. Within this broad area, he is working, currently, on crisis and dependent capitalism, public debt and financialization, and financialization and premature deindustrialization in the African context. With CEsA, IESE and the Centro de Estudos Sociais (Centre for Social Studies), CES, of the Coimbra University, he is involved in two studies focused on the political economy of African Socialisms and the political economy of African capitalisms in the era of global financialization and of crisis of and in neoliberalism. In 2015, he was awarded the Ruth First prize for the best article on political economy of African development by the Review of African Political Economy, ROAPE, as well as two prizes for dedication to major public causes, one by the city of Quelimane, Zamb\u00e9zia, Mozambique (by which he was made honorary citizen of the city) and another by the civil society coordination mechanism, MASC, also in Mozambique. He is a member of the Mozambican Academy of Sciences, the Mozambican Association of Economists (AMECON), the Portuguese Association of Political Economy (APEP) and of the editorial board of the Journal for Southern African Studies (JSAS), and a member of the group of reviewers of ROAPE. Information about his work and publications (most of which can be accessed online for free) is available from Research Gate, a data base of scientific research and publications, https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Carlos_Castel-Branco/stats/profile_views. He has recently co-edited, with Elisa Greco, a special issue of the Review of African Political Economy (RoAPE, vol 49, Issue 171, March 2022) titled \"Capital accumulation, financialization and social reproduction in Mozambique\", https://www.tandfonline.com/toc/crea20/current, in which he also published two articles, \"The historical logic of the mode of capital accumulation in Mozambique\" and, co-authored with Diogo Maia, \"Financialization, narrow specialisation of production and capital accumulation in Mozambique\" (both articles, and the editorial of the special issue, \"Mozambique - neither miracle nor mirage\", co-authored with Elisa Greco, can be freely accessed from his research gate website).\n\nParagraph 5: The band's name (meaning \"dancing manias\" in German) came about by randomly pointing to words in a German dictionary, the same technique Stipe had employed to find the R.E.M. moniker (except with an English dictionary). The band toured the U.S. southeast and recorded a single for David Healy's Dasht Hopes label. In his book \"It crawled from the South\", Marcus Grey writes: \"Determined to pursue his art-noise interests parallel to his more conventional activities with R.E.M., Michael hooked up with William Lee Self, Neil McArthur and David Pierce in Tanzplagen. The connection was strengthened when Oh-OK Lynda Stipe and Linda Hopper contributed backing vocals at a 40 Watt Club appearance that was taped to provide a rough-and ready three track demo. It includes the Self compositions 'Living By the Neck' and 'Peter Pan', and the Stipe-Self song 'meeting'. In addition to further occasional appearances in town and one short local tour Tanzplagen even got as far as recording tracks for a single, intended for release on David Healys ill-fated Dasht Hopes label. The studio chosen was Bombay in Smyrna where back in February R.E.M. had made its first recordings. Neil McArthur had left by the time of the session, and so William Lee Self, the groups real leader, doubled on bass while Lynda Stipe supplied vocals. However it is Michaels contribution to the two songs recorded ('meeting' and Self's 'treason') that Producer Joe Perry remembers: 'Micheal would sing and bang on a Farfisa organ creating a large explosion. It was a different time. Experimental stuff'\". Soon later, R.E.M. were signed to IRS and released the Chronic Town EP (which had been recorded for Healy's label's debut release), but the Tanzplagen single went unreleased until 1991 when Strangeways Records brought it out as their inaugural release. The CD includes a duet with Stipe and his sister Lynda and some improvised live recordings that include Linda Hopper, her bandmate at the time in the band Oh-OK. Self describes the contents of \"The Lost Single and Live at the 40 Watt club, Athens Georgia 1981\": \"thus I wrote the song 'Living By The Neck' but had no title for it, Stipe came up with the title only meaning 'living by the guitar neck'. We also intentionally booked all our in town shows on full moon nights - this truly made a drastic but wonderful difference in the atmosphere and audiences behaviour.\" Tanzplagen dissolved in late 1982 when Self relocated to Germany. David Pierce went on to form Buzz Of Delight with Mathew Sweet. Neil McArthur continued his studies at the University of Georgia.\n\nParagraph 6: At the start, race starter Pat Vidan erroneously threw the green flag a lap early, triggering an 11-car accident which unfolded on the main stretch approximately 200 yards past the start/finish line, which halted the race immediately. As the green flag fell, Steve Krisiloff's car developed ignition problems and slowed on the front straightaway, falling back to parallel with the fifth row by the time he crossed the start/finish line. This caused the rest of the field behind Krisiloff to shuffle towards the outside to avoid the slowing car. Seconds later in the sixth row, just past the start/finish line, Salt Walther tangled wheels with Jerry Grant, climbed over Grant's left-front wheel, overturned in the air and slammed into the catch fence. The car cut a  chunk out of the fence on impact, breaking two 4 inch steel stanchions before being thrown back onto the track by the reinforcing cables positioned behind the fence. The impact ripped open both of Walther's fuel tanks, sending 75 gallons of flaming methanol in a massive pale blue fireball (not apparent on TV or film footage) and dousing many spectators; with the blast of heat felt at least 100 yards away in the Paddock grandstand and Track Boxes, per eyewitness accounts. Eleven grandstand spectators were injured, and nine required hospitalization. As the front of Walther's car dug into the fence, the nose was also sheared off and Walther's legs were exposed. The car landed back on the racing surface upside-down, and spun wildly down the main stretch, spraying burning fuel in all directions. The spinning car was hit by at least two other cars, and a total of at least ten other cars became involved in the crash, including: Wally Dallenbach, Mike Hiss, Lee Kunzman, John Martin, David Hobbs, Mike Mosley, Jim McElreath and Dick Simon. Several cars were damaged extensively, and debris and burning fuel now littered the track. Kunzman later recalled that he thought he had been blinded by hitting the burning fuel until his car stopped and he flipped up his visor, as the intense heat had crinkled it so severely, he could not see where he was going.\n\nParagraph 7: The Return of Ishtar is an adventure game that requires two players. It was also the first game from Namco to have a password feature, to give players the opportunity to continue from where they left off, and their first to not feature a scoring system. Player 1 controls the priestess Ki who fights with magic, while Player 2 controls the sword-wielding Prince Gilgamesh. This sequel starts off directly after Gilgamesh has saved Ki from Druaga, and focuses on their escape from the tower (and its inhabitants) who are after Gilgamesh and Ki to avenge their former master. There are a total of 128 rooms in the sixty-floor tower, and the screen will only scroll according to Ki's location, so the second player will have to stay close to their partner as they traverse the tower. Ki attacks by casting spells at the enemies, while Gilgamesh automatically draws his sword whenever an enemy gets close enough to him, allowing him to attack the enemy by bumping into it with his blade (similar to Adol from the Ys games). However, colliding with enemies will also damage Gilgamesh, and the counter in the bottom-right of the screen will decrease by a preset amount, depending on what enemy type it was. If the counter reaches 0, he will disappear, and the game will be over for both players (which will also happen if Ki is touched by any enemy at all). There are also several different items that can be found in the rooms and collected to aid Gilgamesh and Ki in their quest. As an easter egg, the game's designer, Masanobu End\u014d, appears unconscious at his desk in the \"Dead End\" room. Ki can use the Blue Crystal Rod spell on him to wake him up; he will then proceed to warp her and Gilgamesh to the \"Calvary Prison\" room.\n\nParagraph 8:  McCartney has enjoyed a successful solo career releasing four albums, and spawning three top ten singles. He's appeared on many television shows, including Disney's Hannah Montana and The Suite Life of Zack & Cody, as well as a 2008 episode of Law & Order: Special Victims Unit. McCartney had a starring role on The WB's show Summerland, alongside future stars like Zac Efron, and was set to star in Locke and Key; however, the pilot was not picked up for an entire season. In 2008, McCartney was cast as the lead role in the independent film Keith. McCartney had a recurring role in Season 4 of the ABC Family series, Greek, and appeared as a lead in the 2012 movie Chernobyl Diaries, which was a moderate box office success. In June 2011, McCartney released a fragrance for women, \"Wanted\".  McCartney has also forayed into voice acting, performing as Dick Grayson/Robin on the show Young Justice, Terence in the Tinker Bell films, Theodore in the Alvin and the Chipmunks films, and voicing Roxas and Ventus in the popular (English versions) of Kingdom Hearts series of video games. He starred on the hit series Young & Hungry as Cooper. In 2020, he was named the runner-up on the third season of The Masked Singer as the \"Turtle\".\n\nParagraph 9: CDI triggered by two sets of points. A basic problem with the rotary engine design is a lack of engine braking, partially due to the mass of the rotor. Leaning of the mixture on overrun also contributes to erratic and \"lumpy\" running. One way to solve the problem is to shut off ignition entirely on overrun, but this leads to excessive contamination of the combustion chamber by unwanted deposits, which can cause the apex seals to stick. Suzuki opted for a compromise by using two sets of ignition points. One set of points ran on a dual lobe cam for normal operation, firing the rotor every face. The other set ran on a single cam on the same shaft for triggering the spark plug on overrun. The second set (the B points) were triggered by an rpm sensor (the speed relay) and a vacuum switch, which meant that they worked on engine deceleration (high vacuum) and above 1,700\u00a0rpm. This system fired the rotor every second face. This kept the combustion chambers relatively clean. It also served to smooth the lumpy feel of the bike as RPM reduced on overrun and addressed some issues with backfiring (more correctly, \"afterfiring\"). Engine braking is also significantly improved. The B point system was discontinued on the \"A\". It is believed that the factory also employed mechanics to visit dealerships and disconnect the B points on any \"M\" (1975) models still in the showrooms. Suzuki toyed with the idea of two plugs like the Mazda's, but as with so much of their engineering on this bike, overthought the application, believing that they would require two plugs of different heat ranges. The idea was dropped, and the bike shipped with a single 18\u00a0mm conical seat gold palladium spark plug housed in a copper insert in the rotor housing (NGK A9EFV).\n\nParagraph 10: Lake Hula was historically referred to by different names. The 14th century BCE Egyptians called the lake Samchuna, while the Hebrew Bible records it as Merom. In the 1st century CE, the Jewish-Roman historian Flavius Josephus termed it Semechonitis (), John Lightfoot writing it as Samochonitis, while in the Talmud it is called Yam Sumchi \u2013 i.e. Sea of Sumchi. Currently the lake is called Buheirat el Huleh in Arabic and Agam ha-Hula in Hebrew, stemming from the Aramaic Hulata or Ulata. The \"Waters of Merom\" has sometimes been used in scientific literature, although that term refers specifically to springs on the western side of the valley.\n\nThe following is an abstract.\n\nDuring a race, the starter mistakenly waved the green flag too early, causing a chain reaction accident involving 11 cars. One car had ignition problems and slowed down, causing other cars to shift towards the outside to avoid it. Another car collided with another, overturning and crashing into the catch fence. This impact damaged the fence and caused the car's fuel tanks to rupture, resulting in a massive fireball and injuries to spectators. The car then landed upside-down on the track and spun out of control, hitting several other cars. The intense heat from the fire affected the visibility of some drivers.\n\nPlease enter the number of the paragraph that the abstract is from.

The impact ripped open both of Walther's fuel tanks, sending 75 gallons of flaming methanol in a massive pale blue fireball (not apparent on TV or film footage) and dousing many spectators; with the blast of heat felt at least 100 yards away in the Paddock grandstand and Track Boxes, per eyewitness accounts. Eleven grandstand spectators were injured, and nine required hospitalization. As the front of Walther's car dug into the fence, the nose was also sheared off and Walther's legs were exposed. The car landed back on the racing surface upside-down, and spun wildly down the main stretch, spraying burning fuel in all directions. The spinning car was hit by at least two other cars, and a total of at least ten other cars became involved in the crash, including: Wally Dallenbach, Mike Hiss, Lee Kunzman, John Martin, David Hobbs, Mike Mosley, Jim McElreath and Dick Simon. Several cars were damaged extensively, and debris and burning fuel now littered the track. Kunzman later recalled that he thought he had been blinded by hitting the burning fuel until his car stopped and he flipped up his visor, as the intense heat had crinkled it so severely, he could not see where he was going.\n\nParagraph 7: The Return of Ishtar is an adventure game that requires two players. It was also the first game from Namco to have a password feature, to give players the opportunity to continue from where they left off, and their first to not feature a scoring system. Player 1 controls the priestess Ki who fights with magic, while Player 2 controls the sword-wielding Prince Gilgamesh. This sequel starts off directly after Gilgamesh has saved Ki from Druaga, and focuses on their escape from the tower (and its inhabitants) who are after Gilgamesh and Ki to avenge their former master. There are a total of 128 rooms in the sixty-floor tower, and the screen will only scroll according to Ki's location, so the second player will have to stay close to their partner as they traverse the tower. Ki attacks by casting spells at the enemies, while Gilgamesh automatically draws his sword whenever an enemy gets close enough to him, allowing him to attack the enemy by bumping into it with his blade (similar to Adol from the Ys games). However, colliding with enemies will also damage Gilgamesh, and the counter in the bottom-right of the screen will decrease by a preset amount, depending on what enemy type it was. If the counter reaches 0, he will disappear, and the game will be over for both players (which will also happen if Ki is touched by any enemy at all). There are also several different items that can be found in the rooms and collected to aid Gilgamesh and Ki in their quest. As an easter egg, the game's designer, Masanobu End\u014d, appears unconscious at his desk in the \"Dead End\" room. Ki can use the Blue Crystal Rod spell on him to wake him up; he will then proceed to warp her and Gilgamesh to the \"Calvary Prison\" room.\n\nParagraph 8:  McCartney has enjoyed a successful solo career releasing four albums, and spawning three top ten singles. He's appeared on many television shows, including Disney's Hannah Montana and The Suite Life of Zack & Cody, as well as a 2008 episode of Law & Order: Special Victims Unit. McCartney had a starring role on The WB's show Summerland, alongside future stars like Zac Efron, and was set to star in Locke and Key; however, the pilot was not picked up for an entire season. In 2008, McCartney was cast as the lead role in the independent film Keith. McCartney had a recurring role in Season 4 of the ABC Family series, Greek, and appeared as a lead in the 2012 movie Chernobyl Diaries, which was a moderate box office success. In June 2011, McCartney released a fragrance for women, \"Wanted\".  McCartney has also forayed into voice acting, performing as Dick Grayson/Robin on the show Young Justice, Terence in the Tinker Bell films, Theodore in the Alvin and the Chipmunks films, and voicing Roxas and Ventus in the popular (English versions) of Kingdom Hearts series of video games. He starred on the hit series Young & Hungry as Cooper. In 2020, he was named the runner-up on the third season of The Masked Singer as the \"Turtle\".\n\nParagraph 9: CDI triggered by two sets of points. A basic problem with the rotary engine design is a lack of engine braking, partially due to the mass of the rotor. Leaning of the mixture on overrun also contributes to erratic and \"lumpy\" running. One way to solve the problem is to shut off ignition entirely on overrun, but this leads to excessive contamination of the combustion chamber by unwanted deposits, which can cause the apex seals to stick. Suzuki opted for a compromise by using two sets of ignition points. One set of points ran on a dual lobe cam for normal operation, firing the rotor every face. The other set ran on a single cam on the same shaft for triggering the spark plug on overrun. The second set (the B points) were triggered by an rpm sensor (the speed relay) and a vacuum switch, which meant that they worked on engine deceleration (high vacuum) and above 1,700\u00a0rpm. This system fired the rotor every second face. This kept the combustion chambers relatively clean. It also served to smooth the lumpy feel of the bike as RPM reduced on overrun and addressed some issues with backfiring (more correctly, \"afterfiring\"). Engine braking is also significantly improved. The B point system was discontinued on the \"A\". It is believed that the factory also employed mechanics to visit dealerships and disconnect the B points on any \"M\" (1975) models still in the showrooms. Suzuki toyed with the idea of two plugs like the Mazda's, but as with so much of their engineering on this bike, overthought the application, believing that they would require two plugs of different heat ranges. The idea was dropped, and the bike shipped with a single 18\u00a0mm conical seat gold palladium spark plug housed in a copper insert in the rotor housing (NGK A9EFV).\n\nParagraph 10: Lake Hula was historically referred to by different names. The 14th century BCE Egyptians called the lake Samchuna, while the Hebrew Bible records it as Merom. In the 1st century CE, the Jewish-Roman historian Flavius Josephus termed it Semechonitis (), John Lightfoot writing it as Samochonitis, while in the Talmud it is called Yam Sumchi \u2013 i.e. Sea of Sumchi. Currently the lake is called Buheirat el Huleh in Arabic and Agam ha-Hula in Hebrew, stemming from the Aramaic Hulata or Ulata. The \"Waters of Merom\" has sometimes been used in scientific literature, although that term refers specifically to springs on the western side of the valley.", "answers": ["Paragraph 6"], "length": 3446, "dataset": "passage_retrieval_en_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "f363b5cfe63d7095514d7273aaa2e31dbfa73f10a71fd7d8", "pred": "6\n\nPlease let me know if I'm correct.

{"prompt": "Here are 30 paragraphs from Wikipedia, along with an abstract. Please determine which paragraph the abstract is from.\n\nParagraph 1: On April 21, 2009, during filming of Season 6, Chapman was allegedly shot at with a handgun while his crew, along with bail bondsman Bobby Brown, were attempting to arrest a fugitive named Hoang Nguyen in Colorado Springs, Colorado. The suspect escaped on a motorcycle and was captured by Chapman about six hours later. This is contrary to evidence shown in the A&E airing of the episode titled \"Easy Rider\", on December 16, 2009. According to Chapman's website and TMZ, Nguyen was arrested and charged with attempted murder related to the shooting attempt of Chapman and the Chapman family. On May 15, 2009, the El Paso County, Colorado Assistant District attorney dropped the attempted murder charge against the alleged shooter due to lack of evidence and conflicting statements by Chapman, his son Leland, and bail bondsman Bobby Brown. The prosecutors also state that they have not received the requested video footage from the incident, which was allegedly filmed by the television crew. In March 2011, Nguyen filed a lawsuit against Chapman, Brown, and Chapman's sons Duane Chapman II and Leland Chapman. In the lawsuit, Nguyen claims he lost his job as a result of the incident and had to relocate. He also says he was injured by pepper pellets that were allegedly fired at him. Chapman's attorney, James A. Quadra, told Celebrity Crime Reporter the lawsuit has no basis \"in law or fact\". The lawsuit was in mediation the first week of March 2011 with a trial date on November 28, 2011.\n\nParagraph 2: The history of diamond cuts in Europe can be traced to the late Middle Ages, before which time diamonds were employed in their natural octahedral state\u2014anhedral (poorly formed) diamonds simply were not used in jewelry. The first \"improvements\" on nature's design involved a simple polishing of the octahedral crystal faces to create even and unblemished facets, or to fashion the desired octahedral shape out of an otherwise unappealing piece of rough. This was called the point cut and dates from the mid 14th century; by 1375 there was a guild of diamond polishers at N\u00fcrnberg. By the mid 15th century, the point cut began to be improved upon: the top of the octahedron would be polished or ground off, creating the table cut. The importance of a culet was also realised, and some table-cut stones may possess one. The addition of four corner facets created the old single cut (or old eight cut). Neither of these early cuts would reveal what diamond is prized for today; its strong dispersion or fire. At the time, diamond was valued chiefly for its adamantine lustre and superlative hardness; a table-cut diamond would appear black to the eye, as they do in paintings of the era. For this reason, colored gemstones such as ruby and sapphire were far more popular in jewelry of the era.\n\nParagraph 3: Santa Maria Assunta. This parish church dates from the 6th-7th century, but was rebuilt starting in 1530 by Giovanni Matteo Giberti. However, the construction was stopped due to lack of funds, and the church, dedicated to the Assumption of the Virgin Mary, was completed only in 1764. The door portals (1824) are made with white Veronese stone. The interior consists of a nave and two aisles. The eastern side is divided by on six heavy columns, while the southern side has four lighter ones. They are all connected by round arches. The statues of Saints Peter and Paul (1886) were made by the Veronese sculptor Righetti, while a large wooden crucifix dates from the 14th-15th centuries. Behind the crucifix is the printed edict of Pope Innocent II (November 1138) resolving the allocation of tithes. The side altar of St. Anthony of Padua dates from 1720. The altarpiece was painted by Simone Brentani, while the statues in Carrara marble represent San Fabiano and San Sebastiano. The two walnut confessionals (17th century) were carved by the workshop of Andrea Brustolon in Rococo style. The side altar (1648) in the \"Capella dei Caduti\" contains a wooden statue of \"Madonna and Child\" (in Veronese style, 15th century). In the right aisle is located the side altar with the paintings of Saints Luigi Gonzaga and Vincenzo Ferreri by Gaspare Diziani (1764). The baptismal font dates from the 17th century.  The main altar dates from mid 16th century and stands in front of the organ (1958). Behind the altar on the wall is an Assumption of Mary (17th century). The two statues of angels in front of the altar were sculpted by Francesco Filippini (1600). The pulpit was made out of briar root and walnut.\n\nParagraph 4: After a short campaign in North Africa against a Turkish attack on the Suez Canal in 1915, the SA Scottish were sent to France. Here they took part in the Battle of Delville Wood as part of the Battle of the Somme in 1916. In the days between 15 July and 19 July the total casualty rate was at 74 percent of those who had gone into action. By the end of July the South African Scottish suffered 868 casualties. The final German forces were driven from Delville Wood after an Allied assault on 3 September 1916. After Delville Wood the shattered SA Scottish were reformed and served on the Western front, in particular at Vimy Ridge, the Somme, the Battle of Passchendaele, Marrieres Wood and the Battle of Messines. During its time on the Western Front, the South African Brigade and its Scottish heritage 4th Battalion, first served a lengthy stint with the British 9th (Scottish) Division, and following the Brigade's decimation in March 1918, was reconstituted and incorporated in September into the 66th (2nd East Lancashire) Division until the end of the war.\n\nParagraph 5: The 1962 World Series was the championship series of Major League Baseball's (MLB) 1962 season. The 59th edition of the World Series, it was a best-of-seven playoff that matched the defending American League (AL) and World Series champion New York Yankees against the National League (NL) champion San Francisco Giants. The Yankees won the series in seven games for the 20th championship in team history. It is best remembered for its dramatic conclusion in Game 7; with runners on second and third base and two outs in the bottom of the ninth inning, the Giants\u2019 Willie McCovey hit a hard line drive that was caught by Yankees second baseman Bobby Richardson to preserve New York's one-run victory. Yankees pitcher Ralph Terry was named the World Series Most Valuable Player.\n\nParagraph 6: The use of the name Murray Park significantly reduced after the club was sold to Craig Whyte in 2011. Moreover, after the liquidation of the company running the club and its assets, many fans held David Murray partly or wholly responsible, and so began calling the facility Auchenhowie (after the geographic area where it is based). In June 2012, the then Rangers Chief executive Charles Green stated he would ask Rangers season ticket holders to vote on renaming the club's training ground. Green proposed that it could be renamed the Moses McNeil Academy or the Davie Cooper Academy after former Rangers players. In June 2016, then chairman Dave King revisited the issue of the renaming of Murray Park and asked Rangers fans to suggest an alternative name.\n\nParagraph 7: Built in 1963, Zolder hosted the Formula One Belgian Grand Prix on 10 separate occasions in the 1970s and 1980s, as well as the 1980 Belgian motorcycle Grand Prix. F1 moved to Zolder in 1973 and with the exception of a race at Nivelles-Baulers in 1974, Zolder was the location of the Belgian Grand Prix until 1982. That year, Canadian driver Gilles Villeneuve was killed during qualifying at the 1982 Belgian Grand Prix. Villeneuve's Ferrari 126C2 collided at speed with the March 821 of Jochen Mass. The Ferrari was torn up in the accident and when rolling, Villeneuve was thrown from the car.\n\nParagraph 8: Lucas Hay is the son of Ste Hay (Kieron Richardson) and Amy Barnes (Ashley Slanina-Davies), and the brother of Leah Barnes (El\u00e0-May Demircan) and Hannah Hay-O'Connor and was played by a child actor William Hall since 2013. He was born on 3 April 2009 and was delivered by Ste and his friend Daniel Raven's (Chris Hargreaves) wife, Abi Raven (Elaine Glover). His name was chosen by Ste. After his birth, Josh Ashworth (Sonny Flood) tried to stop Ste seeing Lucas, but Amy's sister Sarah Barnes (Loui Batley) blackmails Josh into handing Lucas over to Ste and Lucas moves in with Ste. In July, Amy and Sarah's father, Mike (Tony Hirst) found Ste asleep whilst caring for Lucas. As a result, Mike took Lucas and decided to look after him. Ste found Mike and taunted him about his family, Mike then hit him. The next day, Mike approached Abi about her interests in Ste and Lucas. Ste then told Mike that he would no longer be seeing Lucas and he was going to a solicitor. In August 2009, after weeks of drugging Ste, Daniel went behind Abi's back and interviewed a couple who hoped to adopt Lucas. Ste was pushed to the limit and almost shook Lucas, Daniel used this as an excuse to give him to the adopters. Sarah and Mike's ex-girlfriend Zoe Carpenter (Zo\u00eb Lister) help Ste as Abi took Lucas. Abi then made the decision to hand Lucas back to Ste. When a fire is set in Il Gnosh while Lucas and Leah are being looked after by Amy in the flat above, Steph Cunningham (Carley Stenson) saves them after the fire spreads. In 2012, Amy moves away from the village and takes Lucas and Leah to live with her. Lucas and Leah return to the village in December 2012 to stay with Ste, while Amy goes abroad with her new fianc\u00e9e. Amy returns to the village in February 2013 after discovering Ste's relationship with Brendan Brady (Emmett J. Scanlan) she then leaves once more with Leah and Lucas, leaving Ste upset. Ste begins a relationship with John Paul McQueen (James Sutton) and they later get married in December 2014. They later separated and Ste later begins a relationship with Harry Thompson (Parry Glasspool). In August 2016, Amy returns with her fianc\u00e9 Ryan Knight (Duncan James) and they begin battling custody of Leah and Lucas with Ste and Harry. In December 2016, Amy and Ryan won full custody and they keep Leah and Lucas away from Ste when they tell them not to see Ste. In March 2017, Amy and Ryan get married. The next day, Amy gets murdered by an unknown person and Ste gets arrested for Amy's murder. After Mike returned, he tells Leah and Lucas that Amy has died. In August 2017, when being looked after by Tegan, Lucas tells her that he saw Ryan with Kyle Kelly (Adam Rickitt), and Ryan lies to Lucas that he wasn't with Kyle. In September 2017, Amy's mother, Kathy Barnes (Sarah Jane Buckley), decides to take Leah and Lucas but they stay with Ryan, which leads to Kathy leaving the village. In November 2017, Ryan and Ste's half-sister Tegan Lomax (Jessica Ellis) tell Leah and Lucas that they are in a relationship and Leah and Lucas are worried when Tegan is going to replace Amy. \n\nParagraph 9:  Powerful Stuff: An Electricity safety film from 1988, based on the same principles as Play Safe. It shows of a group of boys, Darren, his brother Tom and Andy walking to school together. On the way they set off a gang of teenagers who chase them all the way to an electricity substation. Tom spots a football in there which Darren tries to break in and get, despite there being danger signs and foolishly believing you only have to touch what's inside to get hurt, but a reluctant Andy talks him out of it; instead, they play football with other friends to school. Once they enter the class, Mr. Jones who works for the electricity board, teaches them the dangers of electricity like touching overhead cables, being careless around cables and climbing pylons, showing clips of what happened when people ignored or did not know the danger that could be present in the situation, even stating that electricity can easily kill you, just by being near it, never mind touching it. Darren ignores all of this by listening to his Walkman and daydreaming of going on a motorcycle that his friend was using earlier in the beginning. On the way back from school, the boys see the friend's motorcycle. They come over until Darren sees his friend's ball is deflated, thus making Darren remember the football in the substation and takes Tom with him. Darren breaks through a fence while Tom keeps lookout. Darren runs up to the ball, and as Andy sees the deflated ball he realises that Darren has broken inside the substation to get the football. Darren throws the football but it gets him electrocuted. Tom runs in to help him but gets electrocuted as well, much to the horror of Andy and his friends. Later, the fire brigade, ambulances and the police arrive at the scene at night as Andy remembers Mr. Jones' lecture to the class about dangers of electricity followed by the song \"Yesterday's Men\" by Madness in the background along with the news report of the incident as Andy and his friends mourn for the deceased boys.\n\nParagraph 10: The Constitution of Medina, written shortly after hijra, addressed some points regarding the civil and religious situation for the Jewish communities living within the city from an Islamic perspective. For example, the constitution stated that the Jews \"will profess their religion, and the Muslims theirs\", and they \"shall be responsible for their expenditure, and the Muslims for theirs\". After the Battle of Badr, the Jewish tribe of Banu Qaynuqa breached treaties and agreements with Muhammad. Muhammad regarded this as casus belli and besieged the Banu Qaynuqa. Upon surrender the tribe was expelled. The following year saw the expulsion of the second tribe, the Banu Nadir, accused of planning to kill the prophet Muhammad. The third major Jewish tribe in Medina, Banu Qurayza was eliminated after  betraying the Muslims during the Battle of the Trench. However, there were many Jewish communities in Medina who continued to live in Medina peacefully after these events such as Banu Awf, Banu Harith, Banu Jusham Banu Alfageer, Banu Najjar, Banu Sa'ida, and Banu Shutayba.\n\nParagraph 11: On the July 3 SmackDown, Ziggler defeated Alex Riley to qualify for a spot in the World Heavyweight Championship Money in the Bank ladder match. On July 13, Ziggler, Zack Ryder and Justin Roberts were involved in a car accident in San Diego while driving from Comic-Con; none of them suffered severe injuries. Two days later at the Money in the Bank pay-per-view, Ziggler won the Money in the Bank ladder match to guarantee him the opportunity to challenge for the World Heavyweight Championship at a time of his choosing within the next year. Later that night, Ziggler attempted to cash in the briefcase on Sheamus after Alberto Del Rio attacked him after their match, but Del Rio stopped Ziggler from cashing in. On the following episode of SmackDown, Ziggler again attempted to cash in the briefcase on Sheamus following a tag team match with Del Rio, but was laid out by Rey Mysterio and Sheamus before he could do so. During this time, Ziggler began a feud with Chris Jericho after claiming he had lost his touch, which resulted in Jericho attacking him on two occasions, and defeating him in a singles match at SummerSlam on August 19. The night after SummerSlam, Ziggler defeated Jericho in a rematch; as a result Ziggler retained his Money in the Bank contract and Jericho's WWE contract was terminated. Following this, Ziggler began feuding with Randy Orton on SmackDown four days later, after Orton hit him with an RKO when Ziggler tried to cash his Money in the Bank contract on a vulnerable Sheamus. The following week on SmackDown, Ziggler faced Orton in a match that was won by Orton, Ziggler defeated him in a rematch on Raw by pinning him while holding his tights. Ziggler faced Orton again at Night of Champions on September 16 where he lost again, ending the feud. On November 18 at Survivor Series, Ziggler captained the traditional 5-on-5 elimination tag team match opposite Mick Foley and won the match by last pinning Orton, making him the sole survivor of the match.\n\nParagraph 12: Plesiosaurs showed two main morphological types. Some species, with the \"plesiosauromorph\" build, had (sometimes extremely) long necks and small heads; these were relatively slow and caught small sea animals. Other species, some of them reaching a length of up to seventeen metres, had the \"pliosauromorph\" build with a short neck and a large head; these were apex predators, fast hunters of large prey. The two types are related to the traditional strict division of the Plesiosauria into two suborders, the long-necked Plesiosauroidea and the short-neck Pliosauroidea. Modern research, however, indicates that several \"long-necked\" groups might have had some short-necked members or vice versa. Therefore, the purely descriptive terms \"plesiosauromorph\" and \"pliosauromorph\" have been introduced, which do not imply a direct relationship. \"Plesiosauroidea\" and \"Pliosauroidea\" today have a more limited meaning. The term \"plesiosaur\" is properly used to refer to the Plesiosauria as a whole, but informally it is sometimes meant to indicate only the long-necked forms, the old Plesiosauroidea.\n\nParagraph 13: The Canadian forces began their advance on Falaise, planning to meet up with the Americans with the goal of encircling and destroying most of the German forces in Normandy. The Hitlerjugend division was holding the northern point of what became known as the Falaise pocket. After several days of fighting Meyer's unit was reduced to about 1,500 men, whom he led in an attempt to break out of the pocket. Meyer described the conditions in the pocket in his memoirs: \"Concentrated in such a confined space, we offer unique targets for the enemy air power.\u00a0[...] Death shadows us at every step\". Meyer was wounded during the fight with the 3rd Canadian Division, but escaped from the Falaise pocket with the division's rearguard. The remnants of the division joined the retreat across the Seine and into Belgium. On 27August, Meyer was awarded the Swords to the Knight's Cross with Oak Leaves and promoted to SS-Brigadef\u00fchrer. He led his retreating unit as far as the Meuse, where he and his headquarters were ambushed by an American armoured column on 6September. The division's staff fled into a nearby village, where Meyer and his driver hid in a barn. A farmer discovered them, and informed the Belgian resistance. Meyer surrendered to local partisans, who handed him over to the Americans on 7September.\n\nParagraph 14: Born in Liverpool, he represented Everton at junior level before signing for Blackburn Rovers where he made his professional debut. He spent five seasons with the Lancashire club, playing for them in the Premier League, but was unable to hold a regular first team place. He was sold to Derby County in January 2007, became a regular starter for the team, but he struggled through injuries; In summer 2010 he was released. He subsequently spent two seasons each with Barnsley and Swindon Town before joining Sheffield United in 2014. During his career, McEveley also spent short spells on loan with a number of clubs; Burnley, Gillingham, Ipswich Town, Preston North End, Charlton Athletic and a brief spell at Swindon Town before his permanent switch.\n\nThe following is an abstract.\n\nIn April 2009, during the filming of Season 6, Duane Chapman, also known as Dog the Bounty Hunter, was allegedly shot at by a fugitive named Hoang Nguyen in Colorado Springs. Chapman's crew, along with bail bondsman Bobby Brown, were attempting to arrest Nguyen when the incident occurred. Nguyen managed to escape on a motorcycle but was captured by Chapman several hours later. However, the A&E airing of the episode, titled \"Easy Rider\", contradicted this version of events. According to Chapman's website and TMZ, Nguyen was arrested and charged with attempted murder in relation to the shooting attempt. However, on May 15, 2009, the charges were dropped by the El Paso County Assistant District attorney due to a lack of evidence and conflicting statements from Chapman, his son Leland, and Bobby Brown. The prosecutors also mentioned that they did not receive the requested video footage from the incident, which was allegedly filmed by the television crew. In March 2011, Nguyen filed a lawsuit against Chapman, Brown, and Chapman's sons, claiming that he lost his job and had to relocate as a result of the incident. He also alleged that he was injured by pepper pellets fired at him. Chapman's attorney disputed the lawsuit, stating that it had no legal or factual basis.

The side altar (1648) in the \"Capella dei Caduti\" contains a wooden statue of \"Madonna and Child\" (in Veronese style, 15th century). In the right aisle is located the side altar with the paintings of Saints Luigi Gonzaga and Vincenzo Ferreri by Gaspare Diziani (1764). The baptismal font dates from the 17th century.  The main altar dates from mid 16th century and stands in front of the organ (1958). Behind the altar on the wall is an Assumption of Mary (17th century). The two statues of angels in front of the altar were sculpted by Francesco Filippini (1600). The pulpit was made out of briar root and walnut.\n\nParagraph 4: After a short campaign in North Africa against a Turkish attack on the Suez Canal in 1915, the SA Scottish were sent to France. Here they took part in the Battle of Delville Wood as part of the Battle of the Somme in 1916. In the days between 15 July and 19 July the total casualty rate was at 74 percent of those who had gone into action. By the end of July the South African Scottish suffered 868 casualties. The final German forces were driven from Delville Wood after an Allied assault on 3 September 1916. After Delville Wood the shattered SA Scottish were reformed and served on the Western front, in particular at Vimy Ridge, the Somme, the Battle of Passchendaele, Marrieres Wood and the Battle of Messines. During its time on the Western Front, the South African Brigade and its Scottish heritage 4th Battalion, first served a lengthy stint with the British 9th (Scottish) Division, and following the Brigade's decimation in March 1918, was reconstituted and incorporated in September into the 66th (2nd East Lancashire) Division until the end of the war.\n\nParagraph 5: The 1962 World Series was the championship series of Major League Baseball's (MLB) 1962 season. The 59th edition of the World Series, it was a best-of-seven playoff that matched the defending American League (AL) and World Series champion New York Yankees against the National League (NL) champion San Francisco Giants. The Yankees won the series in seven games for the 20th championship in team history. It is best remembered for its dramatic conclusion in Game 7; with runners on second and third base and two outs in the bottom of the ninth inning, the Giants\u2019 Willie McCovey hit a hard line drive that was caught by Yankees second baseman Bobby Richardson to preserve New York's one-run victory. Yankees pitcher Ralph Terry was named the World Series Most Valuable Player.\n\nParagraph 6: The use of the name Murray Park significantly reduced after the club was sold to Craig Whyte in 2011. Moreover, after the liquidation of the company running the club and its assets, many fans held David Murray partly or wholly responsible, and so began calling the facility Auchenhowie (after the geographic area where it is based). In June 2012, the then Rangers Chief executive Charles Green stated he would ask Rangers season ticket holders to vote on renaming the club's training ground. Green proposed that it could be renamed the Moses McNeil Academy or the Davie Cooper Academy after former Rangers players. In June 2016, then chairman Dave King revisited the issue of the renaming of Murray Park and asked Rangers fans to suggest an alternative name.\n\nParagraph 7: Built in 1963, Zolder hosted the Formula One Belgian Grand Prix on 10 separate occasions in the 1970s and 1980s, as well as the 1980 Belgian motorcycle Grand Prix. F1 moved to Zolder in 1973 and with the exception of a race at Nivelles-Baulers in 1974, Zolder was the location of the Belgian Grand Prix until 1982. That year, Canadian driver Gilles Villeneuve was killed during qualifying at the 1982 Belgian Grand Prix. Villeneuve's Ferrari 126C2 collided at speed with the March 821 of Jochen Mass. The Ferrari was torn up in the accident and when rolling, Villeneuve was thrown from the car.\n\nParagraph 8: Lucas Hay is the son of Ste Hay (Kieron Richardson) and Amy Barnes (Ashley Slanina-Davies), and the brother of Leah Barnes (El\u00e0-May Demircan) and Hannah Hay-O'Connor and was played by a child actor William Hall since 2013. He was born on 3 April 2009 and was delivered by Ste and his friend Daniel Raven's (Chris Hargreaves) wife, Abi Raven (Elaine Glover). His name was chosen by Ste. After his birth, Josh Ashworth (Sonny Flood) tried to stop Ste seeing Lucas, but Amy's sister Sarah Barnes (Loui Batley) blackmails Josh into handing Lucas over to Ste and Lucas moves in with Ste. In July, Amy and Sarah's father, Mike (Tony Hirst) found Ste asleep whilst caring for Lucas. As a result, Mike took Lucas and decided to look after him. Ste found Mike and taunted him about his family, Mike then hit him. The next day, Mike approached Abi about her interests in Ste and Lucas. Ste then told Mike that he would no longer be seeing Lucas and he was going to a solicitor. In August 2009, after weeks of drugging Ste, Daniel went behind Abi's back and interviewed a couple who hoped to adopt Lucas. Ste was pushed to the limit and almost shook Lucas, Daniel used this as an excuse to give him to the adopters. Sarah and Mike's ex-girlfriend Zoe Carpenter (Zo\u00eb Lister) help Ste as Abi took Lucas. Abi then made the decision to hand Lucas back to Ste. When a fire is set in Il Gnosh while Lucas and Leah are being looked after by Amy in the flat above, Steph Cunningham (Carley Stenson) saves them after the fire spreads. In 2012, Amy moves away from the village and takes Lucas and Leah to live with her. Lucas and Leah return to the village in December 2012 to stay with Ste, while Amy goes abroad with her new fianc\u00e9e. Amy returns to the village in February 2013 after discovering Ste's relationship with Brendan Brady (Emmett J. Scanlan) she then leaves once more with Leah and Lucas, leaving Ste upset. Ste begins a relationship with John Paul McQueen (James Sutton) and they later get married in December 2014. They later separated and Ste later begins a relationship with Harry Thompson (Parry Glasspool). In August 2016, Amy returns with her fianc\u00e9 Ryan Knight (Duncan James) and they begin battling custody of Leah and Lucas with Ste and Harry. In December 2016, Amy and Ryan won full custody and they keep Leah and Lucas away from Ste when they tell them not to see Ste. In March 2017, Amy and Ryan get married. The next day, Amy gets murdered by an unknown person and Ste gets arrested for Amy's murder. After Mike returned, he tells Leah and Lucas that Amy has died. In August 2017, when being looked after by Tegan, Lucas tells her that he saw Ryan with Kyle Kelly (Adam Rickitt), and Ryan lies to Lucas that he wasn't with Kyle. In September 2017, Amy's mother, Kathy Barnes (Sarah Jane Buckley), decides to take Leah and Lucas but they stay with Ryan, which leads to Kathy leaving the village. In November 2017, Ryan and Ste's half-sister Tegan Lomax (Jessica Ellis) tell Leah and Lucas that they are in a relationship and Leah and Lucas are worried when Tegan is going to replace Amy. \n\nParagraph 9:  Powerful Stuff: An Electricity safety film from 1988, based on the same principles as Play Safe. It shows of a group of boys, Darren, his brother Tom and Andy walking to school together. On the way they set off a gang of teenagers who chase them all the way to an electricity substation. Tom spots a football in there which Darren tries to break in and get, despite there being danger signs and foolishly believing you only have to touch what's inside to get hurt, but a reluctant Andy talks him out of it; instead, they play football with other friends to school. Once they enter the class, Mr. Jones who works for the electricity board, teaches them the dangers of electricity like touching overhead cables, being careless around cables and climbing pylons, showing clips of what happened when people ignored or did not know the danger that could be present in the situation, even stating that electricity can easily kill you, just by being near it, never mind touching it. Darren ignores all of this by listening to his Walkman and daydreaming of going on a motorcycle that his friend was using earlier in the beginning. On the way back from school, the boys see the friend's motorcycle. They come over until Darren sees his friend's ball is deflated, thus making Darren remember the football in the substation and takes Tom with him. Darren breaks through a fence while Tom keeps lookout. Darren runs up to the ball, and as Andy sees the deflated ball he realises that Darren has broken inside the substation to get the football. Darren throws the football but it gets him electrocuted. Tom runs in to help him but gets electrocuted as well, much to the horror of Andy and his friends. Later, the fire brigade, ambulances and the police arrive at the scene at night as Andy remembers Mr. Jones' lecture to the class about dangers of electricity followed by the song \"Yesterday's Men\" by Madness in the background along with the news report of the incident as Andy and his friends mourn for the deceased boys.\n\nParagraph 10: The Constitution of Medina, written shortly after hijra, addressed some points regarding the civil and religious situation for the Jewish communities living within the city from an Islamic perspective. For example, the constitution stated that the Jews \"will profess their religion, and the Muslims theirs\", and they \"shall be responsible for their expenditure, and the Muslims for theirs\". After the Battle of Badr, the Jewish tribe of Banu Qaynuqa breached treaties and agreements with Muhammad. Muhammad regarded this as casus belli and besieged the Banu Qaynuqa. Upon surrender the tribe was expelled. The following year saw the expulsion of the second tribe, the Banu Nadir, accused of planning to kill the prophet Muhammad. The third major Jewish tribe in Medina, Banu Qurayza was eliminated after  betraying the Muslims during the Battle of the Trench. However, there were many Jewish communities in Medina who continued to live in Medina peacefully after these events such as Banu Awf, Banu Harith, Banu Jusham Banu Alfageer, Banu Najjar, Banu Sa'ida, and Banu Shutayba.\n\nParagraph 11: On the July 3 SmackDown, Ziggler defeated Alex Riley to qualify for a spot in the World Heavyweight Championship Money in the Bank ladder match. On July 13, Ziggler, Zack Ryder and Justin Roberts were involved in a car accident in San Diego while driving from Comic-Con; none of them suffered severe injuries. Two days later at the Money in the Bank pay-per-view, Ziggler won the Money in the Bank ladder match to guarantee him the opportunity to challenge for the World Heavyweight Championship at a time of his choosing within the next year. Later that night, Ziggler attempted to cash in the briefcase on Sheamus after Alberto Del Rio attacked him after their match, but Del Rio stopped Ziggler from cashing in. On the following episode of SmackDown, Ziggler again attempted to cash in the briefcase on Sheamus following a tag team match with Del Rio, but was laid out by Rey Mysterio and Sheamus before he could do so. During this time, Ziggler began a feud with Chris Jericho after claiming he had lost his touch, which resulted in Jericho attacking him on two occasions, and defeating him in a singles match at SummerSlam on August 19. The night after SummerSlam, Ziggler defeated Jericho in a rematch; as a result Ziggler retained his Money in the Bank contract and Jericho's WWE contract was terminated. Following this, Ziggler began feuding with Randy Orton on SmackDown four days later, after Orton hit him with an RKO when Ziggler tried to cash his Money in the Bank contract on a vulnerable Sheamus. The following week on SmackDown, Ziggler faced Orton in a match that was won by Orton, Ziggler defeated him in a rematch on Raw by pinning him while holding his tights. Ziggler faced Orton again at Night of Champions on September 16 where he lost again, ending the feud. On November 18 at Survivor Series, Ziggler captained the traditional 5-on-5 elimination tag team match opposite Mick Foley and won the match by last pinning Orton, making him the sole survivor of the match.\n\nParagraph 12: Plesiosaurs showed two main morphological types. Some species, with the \"plesiosauromorph\" build, had (sometimes extremely) long necks and small heads; these were relatively slow and caught small sea animals. Other species, some of them reaching a length of up to seventeen metres, had the \"pliosauromorph\" build with a short neck and a large head; these were apex predators, fast hunters of large prey. The two types are related to the traditional strict division of the Plesiosauria into two suborders, the long-necked Plesiosauroidea and the short-neck Pliosauroidea. Modern research, however, indicates that several \"long-necked\" groups might have had some short-necked members or vice versa. Therefore, the purely descriptive terms \"plesiosauromorph\" and \"pliosauromorph\" have been introduced, which do not imply a direct relationship. \"Plesiosauroidea\" and \"Pliosauroidea\" today have a more limited meaning. The term \"plesiosaur\" is properly used to refer to the Plesiosauria as a whole, but informally it is sometimes meant to indicate only the long-necked forms, the old Plesiosauroidea.\n\nParagraph 13: The Canadian forces began their advance on Falaise, planning to meet up with the Americans with the goal of encircling and destroying most of the German forces in Normandy. The Hitlerjugend division was holding the northern point of what became known as the Falaise pocket. After several days of fighting Meyer's unit was reduced to about 1,500 men, whom he led in an attempt to break out of the pocket. Meyer described the conditions in the pocket in his memoirs: \"Concentrated in such a confined space, we offer unique targets for the enemy air power.\u00a0[...] Death shadows us at every step\". Meyer was wounded during the fight with the 3rd Canadian Division, but escaped from the Falaise pocket with the division's rearguard. The remnants of the division joined the retreat across the Seine and into Belgium. On 27August, Meyer was awarded the Swords to the Knight's Cross with Oak Leaves and promoted to SS-Brigadef\u00fchrer. He led his retreating unit as far as the Meuse, where he and his headquarters were ambushed by an American armoured column on 6September. The division's staff fled into a nearby village, where Meyer and his driver hid in a barn. A farmer discovered them, and informed the Belgian resistance. Meyer surrendered to local partisans, who handed him over to the Americans on 7September.\n\nParagraph 14: Born in Liverpool, he represented Everton at junior level before signing for Blackburn Rovers where he made his professional debut. He spent five seasons with the Lancashire club, playing for them in the Premier League, but was unable to hold a regular first team place. He was sold to Derby County in January 2007, became a regular starter for the team, but he struggled through injuries; In summer 2010 he was released. He subsequently spent two seasons each with Barnsley and Swindon Town before joining Sheffield United in 2014. During his career, McEveley also spent short spells on loan with a number of clubs; Burnley, Gillingham, Ipswich Town, Preston North End, Charlton Athletic and a brief spell at Swindon Town before his permanent switch.", "answers": ["Paragraph 1"], "length": 3490, "dataset": "passage_retrieval_en_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "721b6ef6b4641a7517d4228be3a141ddb2e698348da36083", "pred": "1."}
{"prompt": "Here are 30 paragraphs from Wikipedia, along with an abstract. Please determine which paragraph the abstract is from.\n\nParagraph 1: On a train bound for Bombay from Surat, a Police Inspector questions a young man named Farhaan, who has just obtained his law degree, for his reason to go to Bombay, and whether he has any alliance with Pakistanis. Farhaan answers that he is going to Bombay to live with his father, and he does not know anyone from Pakistan. Farhaan finds out that Bombay Police have been targeting the Muslim community, and in the name of fighting terrorism, have been killing innocent Muslim men, women and children. He discovers that Joint Commissioner of Police, Dev Pratap Singh, is involved in this witch-hunt, and he would like to kill him. Farhaan joins hands with the local Muslim political leader, Latif, and he is provided training in handling guns, and is subsequently made ready for this task. Unfortunately, Farhaan is unable to kill Dev, who escapes unhurt, albeit a little shaken. Chief Minister Bhandarkar views this incident seriously, and instructs the police to root out terrorist elements in the city, which they do so ruthlessly. Farhaan is told to deliver a package to a man near a Hindu temple, and he does so. While at a stop to buy some snacks, the package explodes, killing several people. Since this incident occurred near a Hindu temple, a right-wing political party member, Mangal Rao, organizes riots against the Muslim community. Riots take place, and the police are instructed to observe and not prevent the violence. As a result, hundreds are killed. Latif organizes his men to target and attack Hindus and Hindu establishments, rendering the region unsafe, with people being killed in the name of religion. When Hindus and Muslims have had enough, they publicly ask for peace, it is only then Latif and Mangal Rao agree on a truce, on the condition that no Muslim male, female or child will file a FIR (First Information Report) in any police station, to which Latif agrees. Latif then warns everyone in the Muslim community not to complain against anyone. Period. It is then Farhaan finds out that he has been treated as a pawn by Latif, and decides to trust Dev and become an informer.\n\nParagraph 2: Escape from Samsara - the name being a reference to the Hindu concept of Sa\u1e43s\u0101ra - held its first event at The Fridge on 15 September 1995. Formed from the club Megatripolis, they also held occasional events at the Brixton Academy & Bagleys in London; Spain, Morocco, Germany, Czech Republic, Egypt, Israel and Australia. The resident DJs at their events were Beamish and Oberon and there was usually a live performance by an electronic music artist or group, the most frequent appearances being by Cybernaut, Lab 4, The Secret and Audio Pancake. The upstairs balcony area was home to a market which sold fluoro clothing accessories, chai tea, etc. Also noteworthy is the admission and pricing policy where clubbers paid only \u00a33 for entry (compared to the standard price of \u00a310 or more) if they brought a \"drum or didge\", thus encouraging punters to contribute musically and supporting those who could not afford the full price.  Escape From Samsara then went on to run every Friday night for a number of years at The Fridge with DJs such at Rubec, Tim Samsara, Darren Shambhala, Chris Liberator, Mark EG, Blu Peter and Mark Sinclair all playing behind the decks.  Escape From Samsara became a world-renowned brand that was known for its extraordinary friendly ambience, non profit ethos, whacky performers, free bananas at the end of the night, stunning decorations, giant balloons, confetti drops and pyrotechnic shows. For many it was an introduction into an alternative lifestyle.\n\nParagraph 3: Unlike closed-box loudspeakers, which are nearly airtight, a bass reflex system has an opening called a port or vent cut into the cabinet, generally consisting of a pipe or duct (typically circular or rectangular cross section). The air mass in this opening resonates with the \"springiness\" of the air inside the enclosure in exactly the same fashion as the air in a bottle resonates when a current of air is directed across the opening. Another metaphor often used is to think of the air like a spring or rubber band. The frequency at which the box/port system resonates, known as the Helmholtz resonance, depends upon the effective length and cross sectional area of the duct, the internal volume of the enclosure, and the speed of sound in air. In the early years of ported speakers, speaker designers had to do extensive experimentation to determine the ideal diameter of the port and length of the port tube or pipe; however, more recently, there are numerous tables and computer programs that calculate, for a given size of cabinet, how large the port should be and how long the tube should be. Even with these programs, however, some experimentation with prototypes is still necessary to determine if the enclosure sounds good.\n\nParagraph 4: In 1946 Trans World Airlines (TWA) and Pennsylvania Central Airlines, the predecessor of Capital Airlines, served Williamsport; All American Aviation, the predecessor of Allegheny Airlines, joined them in 1949. In 1950 Capital Airlines was flying Douglas DC-3s to Baltimore, Buffalo, NY, Philadelphia, Rochester, NY and Washington D.C. National Airport. In 1961 Capital was merged into United Airlines which continued at Williamsport. In 1964 TWA Lockheed Constellations flew Boston - Albany, NY - Binghamton - Wilkes-Barre/Scranton - Williamsport - Pittsburgh - Columbus, OH - Indianapolis - St. Louis - Kansas City.  TWA left IPT in 1965. In early 1966 United Airlines Vickers Viscounts flew nonstop to Philadelphia, Harrisburg and Elmira and direct to New York Newark Airport, Washington National Airport and Buffalo.  United left the airport later in 1966; Allegheny continued nonstop flights to Erie, New York LaGuardia Airport, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Philipsburg, PA and Wilkes-Barre/Scranton and direct to Boston, Cleveland, Detroit, Dubois, PA, Hartford, CT, New York Newark Airport and Providence, RI operated with Convair 440s and Convair 580s. In the mid 1970s Allegheny BAC One-Elevens and McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30s flew nonstop to Binghamton, Ithaca and Pittsburgh and direct to Chicago O'Hare Airport, Cleveland, Dayton and Utica, NY Allegheny Commuter took over in 1979 with Beechcraft and Nord 262 flying nonstop from Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, New York Newark Airport, Harrisburg and Wilkes-Barre/Scranton, and was the only airline at the airport in fall 1979. Allegheny Commuter service continued for Allegheny successor USAir.  In early 1985 Allegheny Commuter had three weekday nonstops from Philadelphia and four weekday nonstops from Pittsburgh with Short 330s and Short 360s. In fall 1994 USAir Express, successor to Allegheny Commuter, flew Beechcraft 1900C and Short 360s to Philadelphia and BAe Jetstream 31s and Embraer EMB-120 Brasilias to Pittsburgh.  USAir changed its name to US Airways and in 2004 its affiliate US Airways Express ended flights to Pittsburgh International Airport. US Airways merged with American Airlines in 2015; in June 2016 American Eagle typically had three regional jet flights a day for American Airlines to its hub in Philadelphia. On August 18, 2020 American Eagle service was switched from Philadelphia to two daily flights to Charlotte, NC however all service ended on October 7, 2020. American Eagle resumed service on January 5, 2021 with one daily flight to Philadelphia however this flight ended on September 30, 2021.\n\nParagraph 5: William Irvine (November 3, 1741July 29, 1804) was an Irish-American physician, soldier, and statesman from Carlisle, Pennsylvania. He practiced medicine as a ship's surgeon for the Royal Navy before he sympathized with the American Revolution and fought against the British during the American Revolutionary War. As tensions escalated between the American colonies and the British government during the 1770s, Irvine sympathized and allied himself with the revolutionary cause. He subsequently served as a brigadier general in the American Revolutionary War and served in the western theater. After the war he served in the Continental Congress, and later played an active role in ending the Whiskey Rebellion in Pennsylvania. He also served one term in Congress representing Pennsylvania, and was also active in the state's other public affairs.\n\nParagraph 6: The concept of rationality in economics is essentially no different than the manner with which philosophers view practical rationality as it applies to other disciplines in which there exist models of sound judgment, inferencing, and decision-making. Rationality is thus understood as the process through which reasonable conclusions are reached on the basis of thoughtful consideration of demonstrable proof so that the optimal result may be achieved. The fundamental cost-benefit analysis is a typical manifestation of the rationalization process in that the calculated advantages or rewards received will demonstrably outweigh the incurred sacrifice required to obtain those gains. Where the term becomes complicated is the point at which rationality is presumed to label a decision as being successful or unsuccessful, when the reality is that rational decision-making refers to the actual process of making a choice and not the choice itself. When individuals decide what is the best course of action, they do so according to what they perceive is most beneficial and/or fulfilling to them, based on whatever data they have available for consideration. So long as the outcome is consistent with the reasons for electing to behave in that way, the decision is a rational one. The comic book collector who pays thousands of dollars for a collectible issue that completes a long-incomplete series in lieu of buying groceries for the family may not be making a wise choice or even a prudent decision. If this behavior is consistent with the collector's past choices and has been a stated long-term goal, however, then such behavior is nevertheless rational. Rationality is applicable to why a choice was made and what motivated that decision rather than being applied as an evaluative assessment of the choice itself.\n\nParagraph 7: The Wonders of the East is found in three manuscripts. It is in the Beowulf manuscript (also known as the Nowell Codex, London, British Library, Cotton Vitellius A. xv). It is written in Late West Saxon in a Mercian dialect. Other than Beowulf and The Wonders of the East, the other works in this codex include: The Passion of St. Christopher, The Letter of Alexander to Aristotle, and Judith. One scribe is believed to have copied The Passion of St. Christopher, The Letter of Alexander to Aristotle, The Wonders of the East, and first part of Beowulf, and another scribe wrote the remainder of Beowulf and Judith. While the first scribe, known as Scribe A used a more traditional square insular minuscule script, Scribe B uses a newer, round minuscule script. This has made it quite difficult to date the codex, as both scripts originate from slightly different periods of Anglo-Saxon society. The date of this manuscript is usually believed to be \u201cwithin a couple of decades of A.D. 1000,\u201d argued to be no earlier than AD 997 and no later than AD 1016, although other scholars have dated it to be from as early as the 8th century. The earliest known owner of the codex was antiquarian Laurence Nowell, who left his signature in the top margin of several pages from the manuscript. The manuscript is heavily damaged from the fire of Cotton Library in 1731 and so some parts of accompanying texts are missing. The codex may have been intentionally put together because four of the manuscripts discuss monsters. Furthermore, it is a \u201cliber monstrorum, or book of marvels, designed for entertainment along with usual edification. Andy Orchard argues the monsters witnessed in The Wonders of the East are identifiable in other texts of the manuscript. The \"Donestre\", cannibal creatures who lure \"foreigners\" in with \"devious words\" before eating all but their heads. These monsters sit and \"weep over the head\", which scholars such as Orchard have used to show how the creature resembles Grendel's Mother from Beowulf. Orchard further argues that these monsters reflect those who do not conform to Anglo-Saxon norms, and are a construction of the \"other\". Christopher Monk discusses theories focused on the sexuality and femininity of the monsters found in The Wonders of the East. He claims these monsters are depictions of human sexuality, aided by the illuminations which accompany the prose. The Wonders of the East is the only text from the Nowell Codex to be illustrated or \"illuminated\" which some highlight as central to the monster studies applied to the manuscript. Orchard argues that the text is a \"liber monstorum\" or \"book of monsters\" and illustrations aid the reader in studying the creatures described in the prose. Other creatures encountered include the snakes, which may stand for dragon. These creatures are said to have \"horns as large as rams\" and anyone who \"strikes them or touches them\" will die and the area around them \"set ablaze\". Another creature called a \"conopenae\", said to have the head of a dog which some scholars have argued links with Saint Christopher from an earlier text, who may have had the head of a dog according to legend.\n\nParagraph 8: The second avenue of promotion from rating to commissioned officer was to the Special Duties (SD) List.  Petty officers and chief petty officers could, with the approval of their commanding officer, become a CW candidate (an 'SD candidate') and such supply branch senior ratings were similarly specially reported on with a view to promotion to officer, generally between the ages of 28 and 35, though most were in their early 30s when promoted to acting sub-lieutenant on the Special Duties List.  Unlike GL and SL (see below) officers, SD officers retained their former rating branch specialisation; for example the supply officer (cash) of a large warship or shore establishment would typically be a lieutenant (SD)(S)(W), the (W) indicating that he is a commissioned officer from the Writer branch of ratings.  SD officers were, of course, promoted from all supply branches \u2013 writer (W), stores assistant/accountant (S) or (V), cook (CK), officer's steward/steward or caterer (CA).  Once confirmed as a sub-lieutenant, an SD officer was promoted lieutenant after three years; promotion to lieutenant-commander (SD) was by selection and, from these, a very small number were promoted to commander from 1966 onwards.  Retirement was generally compulsory at age 50.  A few SD officers were further selected for transfer to the General List, seniority being adjusted on transfer, so as to level the promotion opportunities (generally these officers were earmarked as likely to reach the rank of commander).  In the 1970s, to make up for certain branch shortages, some chief petty officers, age over 35, from the supply branch were selected and promoted temporary acting sub-lieutenant (SD), a few of whom were later promoted to temporary lieutenant (SD).  By the 1980s, supply officers were no longer necessarily being appointed according to the List they were on (GL, SD or SL); it was not uncommon to find, in different ships in the same squadron or flotilla, a pusser in supply charge from each List.\n\nParagraph 9: PA 441 crosses the Conewago Creek into Londonderry Township in Dauphin County and continues north between farmland and some woods to the east and the Norfolk Southern Royalton Branch and the Susquehanna River to the west. The route passes to the east of Three Mile Island, which is the location of the former Three Mile Island Nuclear Generating Station, the site of a partial nuclear meltdown in 1979. Past the former nuclear power plant, the road curves northwest and then north as it runs through wooded areas of homes with the river and railroad tracks to the west of the road. PA 441 crosses the Royalton Branch at-grade and enters the borough of Royalton, heading northwest through residential areas along Canal Street. The route becomes parallel to Amtrak's Keystone Corridor railroad line to the east and crosses the Swatara Creek into the borough of Middletown. Here, PA 441 follows Ann Street northwest and intersects South Union Street, passing through residential areas. The road curves north and comes to a bridge over Norfolk Southern's Royalton Branch, Amtrak's Keystone Corridor, and the Middletown and Hummelstown Railroad at the Middletown station serving the Amtrak line before it reaches an intersection with PA 230. At this point, PA 441 turns east to form a concurrency with PA 230 along West Main Street, a three-lane road with a center left-turn lane, running along the border between Lower Swatara Township to the north and Middletown to the south. The road passes north of the Middletown station along Amtrak's Keystone Corridor before it heads northeast away from the railroad tracks and fully enters Middletown. PA 230/PA 441 passes businesses before running through residential areas as a two-lane road. PA 441 splits from PA 230 by turning north onto North Union Street. The route passes more homes and heads to the east of a cemetery, becoming the border between Lower Swatara Township to the west and the borough of Middletown to the east as it continues north and comes to a bridge over the Pennsylvania Turnpike (I-76).\n\nParagraph 10: If an external magnetic field is applied horizontally, so that it crosses the flow of electrons (in the wire conductor, or in the electron beam), the two magnetic fields will interact. Michael Faraday introduced a visual analogy for this, in the form of imaginary magnetic lines of force: those in the conductor form concentric circles round the conductor; those in the externally applied magnetic field run in parallel lines. If those on one side of the conductor are running (from the north to south magnetic pole) in the opposite direction to those surrounding the conductor, they will be deflected so that they pass on the other side the conductor (because magnetic lines of force cannot cross or run contrary to each other). Consequently, there will be a large number of magnetic field lines in a small space on that side of the conductor, and a dearth of them on the original side of the conductor. Since the magnetic field lines of force are no longer straight lines, but curved to run around the electrical conductor, they are under tension (like stretched elastic bands), with energy bound up in the magnetic field. Since this energetic field is now mostly unopposed, its build-up or expulsion in one direction creates \u2014 in a manner analogous to Newton's third law of motion \u2014 a force in the opposite direction. Since there is only one moveable object in this system (the electrical conductor) for this force to work upon, the net effect is a physical force working to expel the electrical conductor out of the externally applied magnetic field in the direction opposite to that which the magnetic flux is being redirected to \u2014 in this case (motors), if the conductor is carrying conventional current upwards, and the external magnetic field is moving away from the viewer, the physical force will work to push the conductor to the left. This is the reason for torque in an electric motor. (The electric motor is then constructed so that the expulsion of the conductor out of the magnetic field causes it be placed inside the next magnetic field, and for this switching to be continued indefinitely.)\n\nThe following is an abstract.\n\nA bass reflex system is a type of loudspeaker design that has an opening called a port or vent, which allows air to move in and out of the enclosure. This opening resonates with the air inside the enclosure, similar to the way air in a bottle resonates when air flows across it. The frequency at which this resonance occurs depends on factors such as the size and shape of the port, the volume of the enclosure, and the speed of sound in air. In the past, speaker designers had to experiment to determine the ideal port diameter and length, but now there are computer programs available that can calculate these values. However, even with these programs, some experimentation with prototypes is still necessary to ensure good sound quality.\n\nPlease enter the number of the paragraph that the abstract is from. The answer format must be like \"Paragraph 1\", \"Paragraph 2\", etc.\n\nThe answer is: ", "input": "A bass reflex system is a type of loudspeaker design that has an opening called a port or vent, which allows air to move in and out of the enclosure.

Farhaan answers that he is going to Bombay to live with his father, and he does not know anyone from Pakistan. Farhaan finds out that Bombay Police have been targeting the Muslim community, and in the name of fighting terrorism, have been killing innocent Muslim men, women and children. He discovers that Joint Commissioner of Police, Dev Pratap Singh, is involved in this witch-hunt, and he would like to kill him. Farhaan joins hands with the local Muslim political leader, Latif, and he is provided training in handling guns, and is subsequently made ready for this task. Unfortunately, Farhaan is unable to kill Dev, who escapes unhurt, albeit a little shaken. Chief Minister Bhandarkar views this incident seriously, and instructs the police to root out terrorist elements in the city, which they do so ruthlessly. Farhaan is told to deliver a package to a man near a Hindu temple, and he does so. While at a stop to buy some snacks, the package explodes, killing several people. Since this incident occurred near a Hindu temple, a right-wing political party member, Mangal Rao, organizes riots against the Muslim community. Riots take place, and the police are instructed to observe and not prevent the violence. As a result, hundreds are killed. Latif organizes his men to target and attack Hindus and Hindu establishments, rendering the region unsafe, with people being killed in the name of religion. When Hindus and Muslims have had enough, they publicly ask for peace, it is only then Latif and Mangal Rao agree on a truce, on the condition that no Muslim male, female or child will file a FIR (First Information Report) in any police station, to which Latif agrees. Latif then warns everyone in the Muslim community not to complain against anyone. Period. It is then Farhaan finds out that he has been treated as a pawn by Latif, and decides to trust Dev and become an informer.\n\nParagraph 2: Escape from Samsara - the name being a reference to the Hindu concept of Sa\u1e43s\u0101ra - held its first event at The Fridge on 15 September 1995. Formed from the club Megatripolis, they also held occasional events at the Brixton Academy & Bagleys in London; Spain, Morocco, Germany, Czech Republic, Egypt, Israel and Australia. The resident DJs at their events were Beamish and Oberon and there was usually a live performance by an electronic music artist or group, the most frequent appearances being by Cybernaut, Lab 4, The Secret and Audio Pancake. The upstairs balcony area was home to a market which sold fluoro clothing accessories, chai tea, etc. Also noteworthy is the admission and pricing policy where clubbers paid only \u00a33 for entry (compared to the standard price of \u00a310 or more) if they brought a \"drum or didge\", thus encouraging punters to contribute musically and supporting those who could not afford the full price.  Escape From Samsara then went on to run every Friday night for a number of years at The Fridge with DJs such at Rubec, Tim Samsara, Darren Shambhala, Chris Liberator, Mark EG, Blu Peter and Mark Sinclair all playing behind the decks.  Escape From Samsara became a world-renowned brand that was known for its extraordinary friendly ambience, non profit ethos, whacky performers, free bananas at the end of the night, stunning decorations, giant balloons, confetti drops and pyrotechnic shows. For many it was an introduction into an alternative lifestyle.\n\nParagraph 3: Unlike closed-box loudspeakers, which are nearly airtight, a bass reflex system has an opening called a port or vent cut into the cabinet, generally consisting of a pipe or duct (typically circular or rectangular cross section). The air mass in this opening resonates with the \"springiness\" of the air inside the enclosure in exactly the same fashion as the air in a bottle resonates when a current of air is directed across the opening. Another metaphor often used is to think of the air like a spring or rubber band. The frequency at which the box/port system resonates, known as the Helmholtz resonance, depends upon the effective length and cross sectional area of the duct, the internal volume of the enclosure, and the speed of sound in air. In the early years of ported speakers, speaker designers had to do extensive experimentation to determine the ideal diameter of the port and length of the port tube or pipe; however, more recently, there are numerous tables and computer programs that calculate, for a given size of cabinet, how large the port should be and how long the tube should be. Even with these programs, however, some experimentation with prototypes is still necessary to determine if the enclosure sounds good.\n\nParagraph 4: In 1946 Trans World Airlines (TWA) and Pennsylvania Central Airlines, the predecessor of Capital Airlines, served Williamsport; All American Aviation, the predecessor of Allegheny Airlines, joined them in 1949. In 1950 Capital Airlines was flying Douglas DC-3s to Baltimore, Buffalo, NY, Philadelphia, Rochester, NY and Washington D.C. National Airport. In 1961 Capital was merged into United Airlines which continued at Williamsport. In 1964 TWA Lockheed Constellations flew Boston - Albany, NY - Binghamton - Wilkes-Barre/Scranton - Williamsport - Pittsburgh - Columbus, OH - Indianapolis - St. Louis - Kansas City.  TWA left IPT in 1965. In early 1966 United Airlines Vickers Viscounts flew nonstop to Philadelphia, Harrisburg and Elmira and direct to New York Newark Airport, Washington National Airport and Buffalo.  United left the airport later in 1966; Allegheny continued nonstop flights to Erie, New York LaGuardia Airport, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Philipsburg, PA and Wilkes-Barre/Scranton and direct to Boston, Cleveland, Detroit, Dubois, PA, Hartford, CT, New York Newark Airport and Providence, RI operated with Convair 440s and Convair 580s. In the mid 1970s Allegheny BAC One-Elevens and McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30s flew nonstop to Binghamton, Ithaca and Pittsburgh and direct to Chicago O'Hare Airport, Cleveland, Dayton and Utica, NY Allegheny Commuter took over in 1979 with Beechcraft and Nord 262 flying nonstop from Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, New York Newark Airport, Harrisburg and Wilkes-Barre/Scranton, and was the only airline at the airport in fall 1979. Allegheny Commuter service continued for Allegheny successor USAir.  In early 1985 Allegheny Commuter had three weekday nonstops from Philadelphia and four weekday nonstops from Pittsburgh with Short 330s and Short 360s. In fall 1994 USAir Express, successor to Allegheny Commuter, flew Beechcraft 1900C and Short 360s to Philadelphia and BAe Jetstream 31s and Embraer EMB-120 Brasilias to Pittsburgh.  USAir changed its name to US Airways and in 2004 its affiliate US Airways Express ended flights to Pittsburgh International Airport. US Airways merged with American Airlines in 2015; in June 2016 American Eagle typically had three regional jet flights a day for American Airlines to its hub in Philadelphia. On August 18, 2020 American Eagle service was switched from Philadelphia to two daily flights to Charlotte, NC however all service ended on October 7, 2020. American Eagle resumed service on January 5, 2021 with one daily flight to Philadelphia however this flight ended on September 30, 2021.\n\nParagraph 5: William Irvine (November 3, 1741July 29, 1804) was an Irish-American physician, soldier, and statesman from Carlisle, Pennsylvania. He practiced medicine as a ship's surgeon for the Royal Navy before he sympathized with the American Revolution and fought against the British during the American Revolutionary War. As tensions escalated between the American colonies and the British government during the 1770s, Irvine sympathized and allied himself with the revolutionary cause. He subsequently served as a brigadier general in the American Revolutionary War and served in the western theater. After the war he served in the Continental Congress, and later played an active role in ending the Whiskey Rebellion in Pennsylvania. He also served one term in Congress representing Pennsylvania, and was also active in the state's other public affairs.\n\nParagraph 6: The concept of rationality in economics is essentially no different than the manner with which philosophers view practical rationality as it applies to other disciplines in which there exist models of sound judgment, inferencing, and decision-making. Rationality is thus understood as the process through which reasonable conclusions are reached on the basis of thoughtful consideration of demonstrable proof so that the optimal result may be achieved. The fundamental cost-benefit analysis is a typical manifestation of the rationalization process in that the calculated advantages or rewards received will demonstrably outweigh the incurred sacrifice required to obtain those gains. Where the term becomes complicated is the point at which rationality is presumed to label a decision as being successful or unsuccessful, when the reality is that rational decision-making refers to the actual process of making a choice and not the choice itself. When individuals decide what is the best course of action, they do so according to what they perceive is most beneficial and/or fulfilling to them, based on whatever data they have available for consideration. So long as the outcome is consistent with the reasons for electing to behave in that way, the decision is a rational one. The comic book collector who pays thousands of dollars for a collectible issue that completes a long-incomplete series in lieu of buying groceries for the family may not be making a wise choice or even a prudent decision. If this behavior is consistent with the collector's past choices and has been a stated long-term goal, however, then such behavior is nevertheless rational. Rationality is applicable to why a choice was made and what motivated that decision rather than being applied as an evaluative assessment of the choice itself.\n\nParagraph 7: The Wonders of the East is found in three manuscripts. It is in the Beowulf manuscript (also known as the Nowell Codex, London, British Library, Cotton Vitellius A. xv). It is written in Late West Saxon in a Mercian dialect. Other than Beowulf and The Wonders of the East, the other works in this codex include: The Passion of St. Christopher, The Letter of Alexander to Aristotle, and Judith. One scribe is believed to have copied The Passion of St. Christopher, The Letter of Alexander to Aristotle, The Wonders of the East, and first part of Beowulf, and another scribe wrote the remainder of Beowulf and Judith. While the first scribe, known as Scribe A used a more traditional square insular minuscule script, Scribe B uses a newer, round minuscule script. This has made it quite difficult to date the codex, as both scripts originate from slightly different periods of Anglo-Saxon society. The date of this manuscript is usually believed to be \u201cwithin a couple of decades of A.D. 1000,\u201d argued to be no earlier than AD 997 and no later than AD 1016, although other scholars have dated it to be from as early as the 8th century. The earliest known owner of the codex was antiquarian Laurence Nowell, who left his signature in the top margin of several pages from the manuscript. The manuscript is heavily damaged from the fire of Cotton Library in 1731 and so some parts of accompanying texts are missing. The codex may have been intentionally put together because four of the manuscripts discuss monsters. Furthermore, it is a \u201cliber monstrorum, or book of marvels, designed for entertainment along with usual edification. Andy Orchard argues the monsters witnessed in The Wonders of the East are identifiable in other texts of the manuscript. The \"Donestre\", cannibal creatures who lure \"foreigners\" in with \"devious words\" before eating all but their heads. These monsters sit and \"weep over the head\", which scholars such as Orchard have used to show how the creature resembles Grendel's Mother from Beowulf. Orchard further argues that these monsters reflect those who do not conform to Anglo-Saxon norms, and are a construction of the \"other\". Christopher Monk discusses theories focused on the sexuality and femininity of the monsters found in The Wonders of the East. He claims these monsters are depictions of human sexuality, aided by the illuminations which accompany the prose. The Wonders of the East is the only text from the Nowell Codex to be illustrated or \"illuminated\" which some highlight as central to the monster studies applied to the manuscript. Orchard argues that the text is a \"liber monstorum\" or \"book of monsters\" and illustrations aid the reader in studying the creatures described in the prose. Other creatures encountered include the snakes, which may stand for dragon. These creatures are said to have \"horns as large as rams\" and anyone who \"strikes them or touches them\" will die and the area around them \"set ablaze\". Another creature called a \"conopenae\", said to have the head of a dog which some scholars have argued links with Saint Christopher from an earlier text, who may have had the head of a dog according to legend.\n\nParagraph 8: The second avenue of promotion from rating to commissioned officer was to the Special Duties (SD) List.  Petty officers and chief petty officers could, with the approval of their commanding officer, become a CW candidate (an 'SD candidate') and such supply branch senior ratings were similarly specially reported on with a view to promotion to officer, generally between the ages of 28 and 35, though most were in their early 30s when promoted to acting sub-lieutenant on the Special Duties List.  Unlike GL and SL (see below) officers, SD officers retained their former rating branch specialisation; for example the supply officer (cash) of a large warship or shore establishment would typically be a lieutenant (SD)(S)(W), the (W) indicating that he is a commissioned officer from the Writer branch of ratings.  SD officers were, of course, promoted from all supply branches \u2013 writer (W), stores assistant/accountant (S) or (V), cook (CK), officer's steward/steward or caterer (CA).  Once confirmed as a sub-lieutenant, an SD officer was promoted lieutenant after three years; promotion to lieutenant-commander (SD) was by selection and, from these, a very small number were promoted to commander from 1966 onwards.  Retirement was generally compulsory at age 50.  A few SD officers were further selected for transfer to the General List, seniority being adjusted on transfer, so as to level the promotion opportunities (generally these officers were earmarked as likely to reach the rank of commander).  In the 1970s, to make up for certain branch shortages, some chief petty officers, age over 35, from the supply branch were selected and promoted temporary acting sub-lieutenant (SD), a few of whom were later promoted to temporary lieutenant (SD).  By the 1980s, supply officers were no longer necessarily being appointed according to the List they were on (GL, SD or SL); it was not uncommon to find, in different ships in the same squadron or flotilla, a pusser in supply charge from each List.\n\nParagraph 9: PA 441 crosses the Conewago Creek into Londonderry Township in Dauphin County and continues north between farmland and some woods to the east and the Norfolk Southern Royalton Branch and the Susquehanna River to the west. The route passes to the east of Three Mile Island, which is the location of the former Three Mile Island Nuclear Generating Station, the site of a partial nuclear meltdown in 1979. Past the former nuclear power plant, the road curves northwest and then north as it runs through wooded areas of homes with the river and railroad tracks to the west of the road. PA 441 crosses the Royalton Branch at-grade and enters the borough of Royalton, heading northwest through residential areas along Canal Street. The route becomes parallel to Amtrak's Keystone Corridor railroad line to the east and crosses the Swatara Creek into the borough of Middletown. Here, PA 441 follows Ann Street northwest and intersects South Union Street, passing through residential areas. The road curves north and comes to a bridge over Norfolk Southern's Royalton Branch, Amtrak's Keystone Corridor, and the Middletown and Hummelstown Railroad at the Middletown station serving the Amtrak line before it reaches an intersection with PA 230. At this point, PA 441 turns east to form a concurrency with PA 230 along West Main Street, a three-lane road with a center left-turn lane, running along the border between Lower Swatara Township to the north and Middletown to the south. The road passes north of the Middletown station along Amtrak's Keystone Corridor before it heads northeast away from the railroad tracks and fully enters Middletown. PA 230/PA 441 passes businesses before running through residential areas as a two-lane road. PA 441 splits from PA 230 by turning north onto North Union Street. The route passes more homes and heads to the east of a cemetery, becoming the border between Lower Swatara Township to the west and the borough of Middletown to the east as it continues north and comes to a bridge over the Pennsylvania Turnpike (I-76).\n\nParagraph 10: If an external magnetic field is applied horizontally, so that it crosses the flow of electrons (in the wire conductor, or in the electron beam), the two magnetic fields will interact. Michael Faraday introduced a visual analogy for this, in the form of imaginary magnetic lines of force: those in the conductor form concentric circles round the conductor; those in the externally applied magnetic field run in parallel lines. If those on one side of the conductor are running (from the north to south magnetic pole) in the opposite direction to those surrounding the conductor, they will be deflected so that they pass on the other side the conductor (because magnetic lines of force cannot cross or run contrary to each other). Consequently, there will be a large number of magnetic field lines in a small space on that side of the conductor, and a dearth of them on the original side of the conductor. Since the magnetic field lines of force are no longer straight lines, but curved to run around the electrical conductor, they are under tension (like stretched elastic bands), with energy bound up in the magnetic field. Since this energetic field is now mostly unopposed, its build-up or expulsion in one direction creates \u2014 in a manner analogous to Newton's third law of motion \u2014 a force in the opposite direction. Since there is only one moveable object in this system (the electrical conductor) for this force to work upon, the net effect is a physical force working to expel the electrical conductor out of the externally applied magnetic field in the direction opposite to that which the magnetic flux is being redirected to \u2014 in this case (motors), if the conductor is carrying conventional current upwards, and the external magnetic field is moving away from the viewer, the physical force will work to push the conductor to the left. This is the reason for torque in an electric motor. (The electric motor is then constructed so that the expulsion of the conductor out of the magnetic field causes it be placed inside the next magnetic field, and for this switching to be continued indefinitely.)", "answers": ["Paragraph 3"], "length": 3315, "dataset": "passage_retrieval_en_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "871d9417ba06b98b501a20f626a0744f6ba0713376630258", "pred": "3."}

In 1937, he and his mother came to the Soviet Union. In 1939, his mother was arrested and died in imprisonment. He left a high school in Omsk. From 1947 to 1950, he studied at the Omsk Army Medical School. In 1950, he left the Omsk Army Medical School with honours. In 1960, he graduated from the army medical faculty of the Kharkiv Medical Institute with honours as well. In 1969, he graduated from an extramural faculty of the Moscow Literature Institute. He worked as a pharmacist.\n\nParagraph 2:  The education of an architect in the early years of the 20th century was quite different from what it is today, and the ambitious prospective architect could take many avenues to acquire it. In April 1905, for example, Seyfarth attended his first meeting as a member of the Chicago Architectural Club, which had been founded in 1885 as the Chicago Architectural Sketch Club by James H. Carpenter, a prominent Chicago draftsman, with the support of the magazine Inland Architect, whose first issue had been published in February 1883.  The club was formed in Chicago during a period when architecture there was in its ascendancy - after the Great Fire of 1871 a large population of some of the country's best architectural talent had come to rebuild a modern city using the most advanced and progressive techniques of the day.  Even so, the community was taxed trying to perform all of the work that was necessary to keep up with the task. Chicago was developing at a rate that astounded anyone who was paying attention to its growth, such that \"one unfamiliar with the city would find ... fresh subject for astonishment, daily, in [its] ever-changing and ever-extending boundary lines.\" As the Chicago architect John Wellborn Root recalled years later: \"The conditions attending the development of architecture in the West have been, in almost every respect, without precedent. At no time in the history of the world has a community covering such vast and yet homogeneous territory developed with such amazing rapidity, and under conditions of civilization so far advanced. Few times in history have ever presented so impressive a sight as this resistless wave of progress, its farthermost verge crushing down primeval obstacles in nature and desperate resistance from the inhabitants; its deeper and calmer waters teeming with life and full of promise more significant than has ever yet been known.\"The club was an effort to help develop the talents of the city's many draftsmen so that they could become qualified architects themselves, at a time when a formal education for architects was generally unavailable and not required.  (The first architectural school in the United States was founded by architect William Robert Ware at MIT in 1868 with nine students, and even by 1896, the year after Seyfarth's graduation, there were only nine schools in the country with a combined student body of 273.)  Seyfarth joined during the time he worked for Maher, who over the years was an active member of the club as a speaker, writer, exhibitor and judge in its annual competitions.  Seyfarth is known to have entered his work at two of these exhibitions  - the first time in 1903 (before he became a member), when his submission was listed as a \"Library\", and again in 1905, where the subject of the entry was his own house in Blue Island. The preface to the catalogue of the 1905 exhibition was devoted to what the noted architect Elmer Grey (1872\u20131963) called \"Inventive and Indigeonous Architecture\", a phrase which perfectly reflected Seyfarth's design for this particular house and may have been one of the reasons why images of it were included.\n\nParagraph 3: On the war god's interplanetary base on the planet Mars, the Duke of Deception operates the Lie Factory, which uses slaves, spirits from different planets such as Earth and Saturn that inhabit bodies, to craft deceptions for a variety of stratagems. Other slaves are used for gladiator conflicts. When Wonder Woman's astral form traveled to Mars to rescue Steve Trevor, the Duke of Deception recognized her and revealed her identity to Mars after she won in the arena. He gave advice to Mars to pretend not to know who she was to trap her. However, Wonder Woman was able to rescue Steve, overcome Mars and his soldiers, and escape to Earth. The Duke of Deception was the second of Mars' lieutenants sent to capture Wonder Woman, refusing at first as he said his servants were writing propaganda for the Nazis and Japanese and he could not capture Wonder Woman without their help. Wonder Woman was captured by an agent of his, Naha, with her magic lasso after being given a fake lasso. She was taken onto a ship, where she was left bound hand and foot, along with being gagged and blindfolded with plaster. Wonder Woman was able to escape with the help of Etta Candy, who she telepathically contacted. The Duke of Deception tried to convince Hirohito to cause more war in Hawaii by disguising himself as a General, but Wonder Woman foiled his plan to cause further war with the help of Etta Candy and sent his phantom form fleeing back to Mars in the form of a slave girl. He was then imprisoned by Mars, his imprisonment causing Hirohito to speak truthfully to the Italian Ambassador. The Duke of Deception was released when Wonder Woman was brought back in chains by the Count of Conquest. The Duke of Deception enlists the aid of the women-hating Doctor Psycho after finding women are being used in the War Effort, hoping to continue the practice of inequality. After repeated failures, Mars strips him of his mighty appearance, leaving him a weak, toothless man. He was imprisoned with the female slaves, but convinced them to rebel and briefly ruled Mars, imprisoning the god Mars. He took over the Moon and was able to drug the goddess Diana, but was defeated by Wonder Woman.\n\nParagraph 4: During the trip, d'Artagnan fights off repeated attacks by Febre's henchmen. He and Francesca become intimate, only to have Febre discover them and kidnap her and the queen. Febre forces the queen to write a letter to Buckingham asking him to meet her at a heavily fortified castle of his choosing, using the queen's ring to convince him of the authenticity of the message. Richelieu finally realizes just how far Febre is willing to go: he means to start a war between France, England and Spain, a war that will cripple France. Knowing that he has lost control of his chief henchman, Richelieu secretly visits d'Artagnan and tells him of Febre's plans and pleads for his help to stop Febre. D'Artagnan agrees, but only because Febre is holding Francesca. D'Artagnan returns to Paris and convinces the surviving musketeers that their responsibility to the crown remains their highest priority, and they join him at the castle where Francesca, the queen, and Lord Buckingham are being held. They charge the castle on horseback, losing several of their number in the process, but the diversion they create allows Planchet to drive his carriage in front of the castle gates below the field of cannon fire from the castle. This enables him to fire a mortar directly into the castle gates.\n\nParagraph 5: Most Rev. Joseph Osei-Bonsu was born on 8 February 1948 in Jamasi, Ashanti.\u00a0He studied at the St. Teresa's Minor Seminary at Amisano from 1962 to 1969.\u00a0In 1969 he entered the St. Peter's Regional Seminary, Pedu, Cape Coast, from where he proceeded in 1970 to Ushaw College, a Catholic Major Seminary in Durham, England, to continue his training for the priesthood. While at Ushaw College he obtained a B.A. (Hons) in Theology at the University of Durham in 1974. On completion of his studies at Ushaw College in 1975, he returned to Ghana and was ordained a priest at the St. Peter's Cathedral, Kumasi, on 3 August 1975 by the Most Rev. Peter Kwasi Sarpong. He worked at the St. Mary's Church, South Suntreso, Kumasi, for one year as an Assistant Parish Priest. During this time he looked after 49 outstations of the St. Mary's Parish.\u00a0In September 1976 he went for further studies in the United Kingdom. He obtained a Ph.D in New Testament Exegesis at the University of Aberdeen, Scotland, in December 1980. In April 1981 he was appointed lecturer in the Department for the Study of Religions, University of Ghana, Legon, where he taught New Testament Studies, New Testament Greek and Early Church History. From October 1992 to January 1995 he was the Head of the Department for the Study of Religions, University of Ghana.\u00a0He also taught New Testament at St. Paul's Seminary, Sowutuom, Accra, on a part-time basis.\u00a0In 1992 he was appointed by the Pope to be a member of the International Theological Commission based in Rome.\u00a0He held this post until October 1997. Pastorally he worked as Chaplain to the Catholic community at the University of Ghana and at Kwabenya from 1981 to 1995.\u00a0For over ten years he was the National Chaplain of the International Movement of Catholic Students (Pax Romana), Ghana Federation. Apart from a year's sabbatical at St. John's University, Collegeville, Minnesota, U.S.A., in 1987-1988, he worked at the University of Ghana from April 1981 till January, 1995. Granted a year's sabbatical leave by the University of Ghana in January 1995, he went to Rome lecture in New Testament Exegesis at the Pontifical Beda College, a seminary for late vocation students. While he was at the Pontifical Beda College, he was appointed the first Bishop of the newly-erected Diocese of Konongo-Mampong on 17 March 1995. He was ordained bishop on 28 May 1995 along with four others in Accra.\u00a0He was installed the first bishop of the Konongo-Mampong Diocese on 11 June 1995. He is the Chairman of the Board of the Trustees of the Otumfuo Education Fund, Kumasi, Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the Catholic University College of Ghana at Fiapre, near Sunyani, and a former member of the Ghana Education Service Council of the Ministry of Education. From 1992 to 1997 he was a member of the International Theological Commission based in Rome and at that time under the presidency of Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, now Pope Benedict XVI. He is currently a member of the Methodist-Catholic Dialogue Commission which comes under the Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity in Rome.\u00a0He is the Chairman of the Ghana Association of Biblical Exegetes (GABES).He was once the president of Ghana Catholic Bishop's conference (G.C.B.C)\n\nParagraph 6: Five years after serving in the missions, Ferrer swore the solemn vows. She was subsequently transferred from Long Island to Cabo Rojo per request of Ponce's Bishop. Upon arriving, she was received by a procession. As part of this mission, She and the nuns organized baseball teams and sewing schools. She continued working in this convent for 11 years, until she was promoted to abbess. As Mother Superior, Ferr\u00e9 remained in Cabo Rojo for six more years, which is the time limit that a Mother Superior can work within the a mission before receiving another assignment. She was then sent to Hato Rey, where she was assigned to a religious school. Here she replaced part of the institution's materials with new ones, using part of a savings account created by the previous directory. Shortly after she contracted Sepsis, and was removed from the position. Some time later Ferr\u00e9 traveled to the Bronx, where several of the nuns that studied with her in Philadelphia resided. This congregation focused their attention in discouraging street crime. One day, Ferr\u00e9 was forced to dress a gang member in nun's clothing, to confuse the members of a rival gang. Due to her actions, she was promoted to abbess of the convent. She led the other nuns in an effort to revitalize the city's landscape. New York's governor Nelson Rockefeller, awarded her the city's \"Republican Woman\" recognition. The community elected her as their official representative in New York's \"Committee Against Poverty\", but she declined the offer and granted the position to another Puerto Rican resident. She did this because Mayor John Lindsay had previously appointed her as his personal representative. Ferr\u00e9 focused her work in promoting education among street gangs. The convent, interested in promoting community acceptance regardless of religion, was originally called \"Dr. White Catholic Center\" was renamed \"Dr. White Center\". During this timeframe she continued her education, briefly attending Holly Family College and completing her bachelor's degree at St. Joseph's College for Women. After a stint as a teacher in Philadelphia, she was sent back to New York in order to complete and further her studies. Ferr\u00e9 completed a sociology master's degree at Fordham University, submitting a thesis based in the strengths and weaknesses of Puerto Rican families that faced conditions of discrimination and poverty after migrating to the city. Her final work in the United States took place in Chicago, where she coached a group of Puerto Rican community leaders.\n\nParagraph 7: De Witt was appointed in 1807 by the state legislature, at the request of the New York City Common Council, to a three-man commission which was to determine how the city's future streets would be laid out.  Frustrated by opposition from landowners, who wanted to determine for themselves where streets would go as they developed their properties, and interference from various political factions, the Council had called on the state for assistance.  The Commission was given \"exclusive power to lay out streets, roads, and public squares, of such width, extent, and direction, as to them shall seem most conducive to public good, and to shut up, or direct to be shut up, any streets or parts thereof which have been heretofore laid out... [but] not accepted by the Common Council.\"  The commissioners were authorized to be paid $4 a day for their work () \u2013 although De Witt was the only one who was actually compensated; the other two commissioners, Gouvernor Morris and John Rutherfurd, were rich men and waived their fees.  De Witt, however, also wanted additional compensation for the days he spent traveling from his home in Albany to New York City, and for Sundays he was required, because of Commission business, to stay in the city; he was reluctantly given travel payment, but was refused additional payment for his Sundays in New York City.\n\nParagraph 8: In the congressional elections of 1830 Jenifer was elected in the first constituency of Maryland in the US House of Representatives in Washington, DC, where he succeeded on 4 March 1831, the successor to Clement Dorsey. Since he was not re-elected in 1832, he was initially only able to complete only one term in Congress until March 3, 1833. This was marked by discussions about the policies of President Andrew Jackson. In these years, the Nullification Crisis reached its peak with the state of South Carolina. In 1834 Jenifer was re-elected to Congress in the seventh district of his state, where he was able to complete three more legislative periods between March 4, 1835, and March 3, 1841. There he experienced until 1837 the final phase of the term of President Jackson.\n\nParagraph 9: Creative Assembly was founded in 1987 by Tim Ansell. Ansell had begun professional computer programming in 1985, working on video games for the Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64, and Atari 8-bit family. Initially, Ansell kept the company small so he could personally work on computer programming. The company's early work, often produced personally by Ansell, involved porting games from the Amiga platform to DOS, such as the 1989 titles Geoff Crammond's Stunt Car Racer and Shadow of the Beast by Psygnosis. Creative Assembly began work with Electronic Arts in 1993, producing titles under the EA Sports label, starting with the DOS version of the early FIFA games. With EA Sports,  Creative Assembly was able to produce low development risk products bearing official league endorsements. The company's products included Rugby World Cup titles for 1995 and 2001, the game for the 1999 Cricket World Cup and the Australian Football League games for 1998 and 1999, of which the AFL 98 title was particularly successful in the Australian market. When it became clear that the company needed to expand further, Ansell employed Michael Simpson in 1996 as creative director. Simpson, a microchip designer turned video game designer, later became the driving force for the creative design of the Total War series. Ansell left Creative Assembly after Sega acquired the developer in 2005, later on, Tim Heaton took over as studio director.\n\nParagraph 10: Greg of PunkNews.org writes that \"Compared to the first Acoustic split, Vol. 2 is more slick sounding, but not in a bad way\", replacing the first album's synth strings with real stringed instruments and digital keyboards with an acoustic piano, making the album \"sound more lush, but never overdone.\" Cape's half of the album includes \"Resolve\" which \"translates pretty well to the acoustic and slower tempo, also including some tasteful tremolo electric [guitar] and something that may be an electric with an ebow. But you're really in for a treat after the tempo change, when it gets downright bluegrass, giving a whole new life to the song, perhaps signifying Joey coming to terms with his friend's death seven years later\"; \"I Must Be Hateful\" which involves \"beautiful fingerpicking and light padding keys, gelling well with Joey's voice\"; \"Know It All\" which \"sounds odd in particular coming from a 40-something instead of a 20-something\" but is \"still a fantastic melody and works well here outside of perhaps the lyrics\"; and \"Broken Record\", an original song to this album \"with simply guitar and Joey's voice\" which is \"very intimate and effective, only building to more aggressive strumming.\" While Greg prefers Cape's songwriting, he says that Sly's arrangements do \"a more thoughtful job of fleshing out his half.\" His half of the album includes \"Black Box\", by which Greg was \"won over by the chorus melody, and the cello, piano, guitar and accordion work[ing] together tastefully without being busy\"; \"Soulmate\", which Sly keeps \"peppy, thank goodness, preserving the bounce with the acoustic providing the backbeat and shaker giving the downbeat\" and which includes a bass that \"even has a punk tone, as chunky piano chords keep a spring in the song's step\"; \"Chasing Rainbows\" \"with its Johnny Cash train-chugging drums, more accordion, and a nice acoustic slide solo\"; \"Pre-Medicated Murder\" which \"doesn't do much for me as a song, but the arrangement is interesting with more accordion and organ chording\"; and \"Liver Let Die\", \"a drunken pub-singalong that works nicely to close out the album.\" The album was \"obviously ... crafted for die-hard fans\" of the two artists, \"though I could see it being used as an 'in' with people unfamiliar with them\", and is \"a big improvement in sonics over the first edition, but like the first, is a very enjoyable listen for old fans such as myself. It's a bit of a nostalgia trip, and surely it was for these two men as well.\"\n\nParagraph 11: In 1969, the same year Mo Siegel and friends collected the herbs in the Colorado Rocky Mountains that would be sold in health food stores and eventually become Celestial Seasonings, Siegel read The Urantia Book, which is a spiritual, philosophical, and religious book that originated in Chicago sometime between 1924 and 1955. The authorship is the subject of speculation, as it is written as if directly from one or more celestial beings. The text was published by the Urantia Foundation in 1955, which provides for the dissemination of The Urantia Book and aims to ensure the text remains unaltered. Mo Siegel currently serves as the President of the Urantia Foundation, and he has said that the morals of the Celestial Seasonings company and the quotes printed on the tea packaging were based on the beliefs and practices of The Urantia Book.\n\nThe following is an abstract.\n\nNekipelov was born to a family working for the Chinese Eastern Railway in the Soviet Union.

In April 1905, for example, Seyfarth attended his first meeting as a member of the Chicago Architectural Club, which had been founded in 1885 as the Chicago Architectural Sketch Club by James H. Carpenter, a prominent Chicago draftsman, with the support of the magazine Inland Architect, whose first issue had been published in February 1883.  The club was formed in Chicago during a period when architecture there was in its ascendancy - after the Great Fire of 1871 a large population of some of the country's best architectural talent had come to rebuild a modern city using the most advanced and progressive techniques of the day.  Even so, the community was taxed trying to perform all of the work that was necessary to keep up with the task. Chicago was developing at a rate that astounded anyone who was paying attention to its growth, such that \"one unfamiliar with the city would find ... fresh subject for astonishment, daily, in [its] ever-changing and ever-extending boundary lines.\" As the Chicago architect John Wellborn Root recalled years later: \"The conditions attending the development of architecture in the West have been, in almost every respect, without precedent. At no time in the history of the world has a community covering such vast and yet homogeneous territory developed with such amazing rapidity, and under conditions of civilization so far advanced. Few times in history have ever presented so impressive a sight as this resistless wave of progress, its farthermost verge crushing down primeval obstacles in nature and desperate resistance from the inhabitants; its deeper and calmer waters teeming with life and full of promise more significant than has ever yet been known.\"The club was an effort to help develop the talents of the city's many draftsmen so that they could become qualified architects themselves, at a time when a formal education for architects was generally unavailable and not required.  (The first architectural school in the United States was founded by architect William Robert Ware at MIT in 1868 with nine students, and even by 1896, the year after Seyfarth's graduation, there were only nine schools in the country with a combined student body of 273.)  Seyfarth joined during the time he worked for Maher, who over the years was an active member of the club as a speaker, writer, exhibitor and judge in its annual competitions.  Seyfarth is known to have entered his work at two of these exhibitions  - the first time in 1903 (before he became a member), when his submission was listed as a \"Library\", and again in 1905, where the subject of the entry was his own house in Blue Island. The preface to the catalogue of the 1905 exhibition was devoted to what the noted architect Elmer Grey (1872\u20131963) called \"Inventive and Indigeonous Architecture\", a phrase which perfectly reflected Seyfarth's design for this particular house and may have been one of the reasons why images of it were included.\n\nParagraph 3: On the war god's interplanetary base on the planet Mars, the Duke of Deception operates the Lie Factory, which uses slaves, spirits from different planets such as Earth and Saturn that inhabit bodies, to craft deceptions for a variety of stratagems. Other slaves are used for gladiator conflicts. When Wonder Woman's astral form traveled to Mars to rescue Steve Trevor, the Duke of Deception recognized her and revealed her identity to Mars after she won in the arena. He gave advice to Mars to pretend not to know who she was to trap her. However, Wonder Woman was able to rescue Steve, overcome Mars and his soldiers, and escape to Earth. The Duke of Deception was the second of Mars' lieutenants sent to capture Wonder Woman, refusing at first as he said his servants were writing propaganda for the Nazis and Japanese and he could not capture Wonder Woman without their help. Wonder Woman was captured by an agent of his, Naha, with her magic lasso after being given a fake lasso. She was taken onto a ship, where she was left bound hand and foot, along with being gagged and blindfolded with plaster. Wonder Woman was able to escape with the help of Etta Candy, who she telepathically contacted. The Duke of Deception tried to convince Hirohito to cause more war in Hawaii by disguising himself as a General, but Wonder Woman foiled his plan to cause further war with the help of Etta Candy and sent his phantom form fleeing back to Mars in the form of a slave girl. He was then imprisoned by Mars, his imprisonment causing Hirohito to speak truthfully to the Italian Ambassador. The Duke of Deception was released when Wonder Woman was brought back in chains by the Count of Conquest. The Duke of Deception enlists the aid of the women-hating Doctor Psycho after finding women are being used in the War Effort, hoping to continue the practice of inequality. After repeated failures, Mars strips him of his mighty appearance, leaving him a weak, toothless man. He was imprisoned with the female slaves, but convinced them to rebel and briefly ruled Mars, imprisoning the god Mars. He took over the Moon and was able to drug the goddess Diana, but was defeated by Wonder Woman.\n\nParagraph 4: During the trip, d'Artagnan fights off repeated attacks by Febre's henchmen. He and Francesca become intimate, only to have Febre discover them and kidnap her and the queen. Febre forces the queen to write a letter to Buckingham asking him to meet her at a heavily fortified castle of his choosing, using the queen's ring to convince him of the authenticity of the message. Richelieu finally realizes just how far Febre is willing to go: he means to start a war between France, England and Spain, a war that will cripple France. Knowing that he has lost control of his chief henchman, Richelieu secretly visits d'Artagnan and tells him of Febre's plans and pleads for his help to stop Febre. D'Artagnan agrees, but only because Febre is holding Francesca. D'Artagnan returns to Paris and convinces the surviving musketeers that their responsibility to the crown remains their highest priority, and they join him at the castle where Francesca, the queen, and Lord Buckingham are being held. They charge the castle on horseback, losing several of their number in the process, but the diversion they create allows Planchet to drive his carriage in front of the castle gates below the field of cannon fire from the castle. This enables him to fire a mortar directly into the castle gates.\n\nParagraph 5: Most Rev. Joseph Osei-Bonsu was born on 8 February 1948 in Jamasi, Ashanti.\u00a0He studied at the St. Teresa's Minor Seminary at Amisano from 1962 to 1969.\u00a0In 1969 he entered the St. Peter's Regional Seminary, Pedu, Cape Coast, from where he proceeded in 1970 to Ushaw College, a Catholic Major Seminary in Durham, England, to continue his training for the priesthood. While at Ushaw College he obtained a B.A. (Hons) in Theology at the University of Durham in 1974. On completion of his studies at Ushaw College in 1975, he returned to Ghana and was ordained a priest at the St. Peter's Cathedral, Kumasi, on 3 August 1975 by the Most Rev. Peter Kwasi Sarpong. He worked at the St. Mary's Church, South Suntreso, Kumasi, for one year as an Assistant Parish Priest. During this time he looked after 49 outstations of the St. Mary's Parish.\u00a0In September 1976 he went for further studies in the United Kingdom. He obtained a Ph.D in New Testament Exegesis at the University of Aberdeen, Scotland, in December 1980. In April 1981 he was appointed lecturer in the Department for the Study of Religions, University of Ghana, Legon, where he taught New Testament Studies, New Testament Greek and Early Church History. From October 1992 to January 1995 he was the Head of the Department for the Study of Religions, University of Ghana.\u00a0He also taught New Testament at St. Paul's Seminary, Sowutuom, Accra, on a part-time basis.\u00a0In 1992 he was appointed by the Pope to be a member of the International Theological Commission based in Rome.\u00a0He held this post until October 1997. Pastorally he worked as Chaplain to the Catholic community at the University of Ghana and at Kwabenya from 1981 to 1995.\u00a0For over ten years he was the National Chaplain of the International Movement of Catholic Students (Pax Romana), Ghana Federation. Apart from a year's sabbatical at St. John's University, Collegeville, Minnesota, U.S.A., in 1987-1988, he worked at the University of Ghana from April 1981 till January, 1995. Granted a year's sabbatical leave by the University of Ghana in January 1995, he went to Rome lecture in New Testament Exegesis at the Pontifical Beda College, a seminary for late vocation students. While he was at the Pontifical Beda College, he was appointed the first Bishop of the newly-erected Diocese of Konongo-Mampong on 17 March 1995. He was ordained bishop on 28 May 1995 along with four others in Accra.\u00a0He was installed the first bishop of the Konongo-Mampong Diocese on 11 June 1995. He is the Chairman of the Board of the Trustees of the Otumfuo Education Fund, Kumasi, Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the Catholic University College of Ghana at Fiapre, near Sunyani, and a former member of the Ghana Education Service Council of the Ministry of Education. From 1992 to 1997 he was a member of the International Theological Commission based in Rome and at that time under the presidency of Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, now Pope Benedict XVI. He is currently a member of the Methodist-Catholic Dialogue Commission which comes under the Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity in Rome.\u00a0He is the Chairman of the Ghana Association of Biblical Exegetes (GABES).He was once the president of Ghana Catholic Bishop's conference (G.C.B.C)\n\nParagraph 6: Five years after serving in the missions, Ferrer swore the solemn vows. She was subsequently transferred from Long Island to Cabo Rojo per request of Ponce's Bishop. Upon arriving, she was received by a procession. As part of this mission, She and the nuns organized baseball teams and sewing schools. She continued working in this convent for 11 years, until she was promoted to abbess. As Mother Superior, Ferr\u00e9 remained in Cabo Rojo for six more years, which is the time limit that a Mother Superior can work within the a mission before receiving another assignment. She was then sent to Hato Rey, where she was assigned to a religious school. Here she replaced part of the institution's materials with new ones, using part of a savings account created by the previous directory. Shortly after she contracted Sepsis, and was removed from the position. Some time later Ferr\u00e9 traveled to the Bronx, where several of the nuns that studied with her in Philadelphia resided. This congregation focused their attention in discouraging street crime. One day, Ferr\u00e9 was forced to dress a gang member in nun's clothing, to confuse the members of a rival gang. Due to her actions, she was promoted to abbess of the convent. She led the other nuns in an effort to revitalize the city's landscape. New York's governor Nelson Rockefeller, awarded her the city's \"Republican Woman\" recognition. The community elected her as their official representative in New York's \"Committee Against Poverty\", but she declined the offer and granted the position to another Puerto Rican resident. She did this because Mayor John Lindsay had previously appointed her as his personal representative. Ferr\u00e9 focused her work in promoting education among street gangs. The convent, interested in promoting community acceptance regardless of religion, was originally called \"Dr. White Catholic Center\" was renamed \"Dr. White Center\". During this timeframe she continued her education, briefly attending Holly Family College and completing her bachelor's degree at St. Joseph's College for Women. After a stint as a teacher in Philadelphia, she was sent back to New York in order to complete and further her studies. Ferr\u00e9 completed a sociology master's degree at Fordham University, submitting a thesis based in the strengths and weaknesses of Puerto Rican families that faced conditions of discrimination and poverty after migrating to the city.

They lost in the first round the following season to Revelstoke. But in 2005-06, the Eagles won the league title for a third time, defeating Beaver Valley in the final again. The Eagles have yet to win another league title. The 2006-07 Eagles suffered a considerable drop in form, finishing fourth in the Okanagan-Shushwap Division, and losing in the first round to the Kamloops Storm. The following year, the divisions of the KIJHL were re-organized, and the Eagles were moved to the Eddie Mountain Conference, East Division. They finished second in their division, but lost in the Division finals to the Revelstoke Grizzlies. In 2008-09, the league was again re-sorted, and the Eagles finished second in the new Okanagan Division. They would lose in the first round to Kamloops. The following season, they finished third in the Okanagan Division, before losing in the second round to the Princeton Posse. In 2010-11, the Eagles were sorted into the new Doug Birks Division, and finished third again, losing to Kamloops in the first round. The following season, the Eagles would finish fourth in their division, and lost in the second round to the Kelowna Chiefs. In 2012-13, the Eagles improved to second in the Doug Birks Division, losing to the North Okanagan Knights in the Division final. 2013-14 saw the Eagles drop to fourth in the Division again, losing 4-1 in the opening round to the Kamloops Storm. The next season would see an identical result, with the Eagles fourth and losing 4-1 to Kamloops, and this marked the first time in franchise history that the Eagles lost in the first round of the playoffs in two consecutive years. Another franchise low occurred in 2015-16, as the Eagles missed the playoffs for the first time in their history, compiling a 10-34-2-6 record, fifth in the Doug Birks Division.\n\nParagraph 2: The population of Lansingburgh is composed largely of persons whose business is located in Troy, but the village sustains several manufacturing concerns which contribute greatly to its wealth and prosperity. Even while Troy was yet a comparatively small village Lansingburgh enjoyed an immense trade with Vermont and Northern New York in grain, beef, pork, butter, cheese and other produce. There were many commission merchants or \"middle-men\" in the village. In the beginning of the 19th century there were at least a dozen warehouses on River street for storing grain. Lansingburgh was then the centre of a great grain trade, buying of the farmers for many miles around and selling at Albany, New York and other cities. About 1825, and even before that date, there were several leather tanneries in operation in the village. Frederick Forsyth, Keating Rawson, Cornelius Lansing, Asa Burt and William Guest owned the most important of these. There were also a number of slaughter and packing houses, among them being those of Ives & Wilson, Tobias Loring, Noel Atwood and Thomas Turner. Before the year 1800 there were four or five \"ship yards\" in town, where sailing vessels for navigation on the Hudson were made. Armington & Hawkins and John Stilson were prominent in this line. The oilcloth industry has been a prominent one for many years. Reference to the factory of D. Powers's Sons has been made in preceding pages. P. C. Davenport, Jonathan E. Whipple and Ferrin engaged in the business at an early day. Caswell's rifle factory began business about 1812 or 1813. Twentyfive men were employed for many years in the three shops. Brush manufacturing was also an early industry, David McMurray being the pioneer in the business. All of his five sons-William, John G., Robert, David and Moses-were engaged in the same business. Large numbers of persons were employed in the various works for many years.\n\nParagraph 3: Romani dishes are usually made hot and spicy with the use of spices, such as paprika, garlic and bell peppers. Potatoes are also a staple in their diet. A traditional Romani dessert is pirogo, which is similar to Jewish kugel. The recipe consists of eggs, raisins, walnuts, pineapple, sugar, butter, egg noodles and cottage cheese. Another traditional dish cooked by Romani people is sarma, salmaia or sodmay, which is made from cabbage stuffed with meat and rice. Romani people consume dishes consisting of stuffed peppers, especially on holidays and special occasions. Romani people also cook pufe (made from fried flour), xaritsa (fried cornbread), bogacha (baked bread) and xaimoko (a meal consisting of rabbit meat). They serve their meals with kafa (coffee) and chao (tea) with sugar and milk or fruits such as strawberries, peach slices, apple slices, or lemon. The Roma believe some foods are auspicious and give luck (baxt). American Roma believe red pepper, black pepper, salt, vinegar, garlic, onions and a sacrificed animal such a lamb to be lucky foods. In Maribor, Slovenia, there is a Romani restaurant called Romani Kafenava. Some itinerant European Romani people cook hedgehog stew. Game animals and birds such as rabbits, hares, quails and partridge are consumed by the Roma. Snails are also consumed. Snail soup and pig stomach are Romani delicacies. Bread form an essential part of any meal. Romani food is cooked outdoors in cauldrons atop a wooden flame. Romani cuisine is also, often of necessity, inexpensive and cheap to prepare and uses portable ingredients. Thus, beef and pork are rare inclusions, while chicken and lamb and goat or wild birds and game are the preferred proteins by the Roma. Potato, peppers, cabbage and rice are often the building blocks in Romani cuisine. Rabbit stew is made with rabbit meat, innards, bacon and onions. The Roma consume roasted apples, almond cakes, clay-baked hedgehog and trout, snails in broth, and fig cakes as a snack. Baked hedgehog is flavored with garlic. The hedgehog dish is called hotchi-witchi or niglo, in Romani.  The hedgehog is wrapped in clay and placed on white-hot stones. When the roasting is done, the prickles attached to the clay are pulled off and the hedgehog dish is served wrapped in leaves. Horse meat is forbidden. Cat meat and dog meat are also forbidden. Frog meat and snake meat are considered unlucky by the Roma and are associated with the Devil. Peacock meat is forbidden. The Roma associate peacocks with the evil eye. The Roma tend to not eat at restaurants and avoid food prepared by non-Roma.\n\nParagraph 4: Hardy's time in the legislature was brief.  He was absent from the province for much of 1970, and was hired as the assistant city manager for Terrance, British Columbia late in the year.  Some described his behaviour during this time as erratic.  He was quoted as saying, \"I have to earn a living, and in Manitoba -- it is totally impossible for a politician to do it solely in politics.\"  He left Manitoba in December 1970, and formally resigned his seat in the legislature on February 16, 1971.  In the 1973 provincial election, he endorsed Liberal candidate Dan Kennedy.\n\nParagraph 5: The dam began to fill in December 1974 after construction was commenced in 1969 by the Portuguese colonial government of Mozambique (Portugal), and is  high by  wide at the crest. Before the Cahora Bassa dam underwent construction, the native people protested the dam in order to keep their land. Built in the first half of the 1970s when Mozambique was still a Portuguese territory, long stretches of the power transmission lines were sabotaged during 16 years of Mozambican Civil War which ended in 1992. The lake has reached a maximum length and width of approximately  and  respectively, flooding an area of  with an average depth of .  Today, the Portuguese government owns eighty-two percent of the Cahora Bassa Lake and the Cahora Bassa dam while the Mozambique government owns the remaining 18 percent. When given the order to begin construction in 1969, the colonial government of Portugal forced the native people out of their homes and villages in order for the Portuguese and European workers to have a place to live during construction. The Cahora Bassa dam was built in order for more power to go to South Africa. The Portuguese government built a small town for all the contractors, electricians, and engineers on top of the native Mozambique homes. The evicted native people were not given compensation for their loss of property. The dam was built to produce electricity for South African farms, mines, and cities. Since the dam transfers the electricity that it creates to South Africa, it is taking electricity away from the natives that were able to keep some of their land. The natives now struggle for electricity and a regular supply of clean drinking water. Before 2010, the average annual rainfall was thirty-seven inches. This has been decreasing ever since and in 2016, the average annual rainfall was twenty-five inches.  If this average continues to fall, the dam operators may have to shut off the flow to some or even all the turbines. Doing so will conserve the water and energy until the reservoir is full enough to allow water to spin the turbines and create more electricity. Having some or all turbines will cause parts of South Africa to lose energy. During the plant shutdown, Songo and Apollo will have a fraction of the energy coming into the converter stations. These places will still be able to use electricity due to the energy that has been stored in a device called an accumulator or by using the pumping method. This method is done by pumping water into a reservoir and letting it go through a turbine when energy is needed..\n\nParagraph 6: Critical reaction to Phantom Phorce was generally positive with Uncut stating that the album features an \"inspired overhaul\" of tracks from Phantom Power, the Western Mail describing the record as a \"mind-bending collection that radically re-works each track from the original record to create something entirely different, but equally appealing\" and musicOMH calling it \"an innovative and thoroughly enjoyable set of remixes\". Some reviews pointed out that the album compares favourably with other remix albums with The Guardian calling Phantom Phorce \"stimulating and often rather beautiful, bucking the trend set by most other self-indulgent and pointless remix albums\" and the NME stating that \"hearing a rock band get the remix treatment is usually a mildly diverting experience rather than a life-changing one. So it's an extremely pleasant surprise to be faced with a whole album of the buggers ... and be thoroughly entertained.\" Q stated that the commentary by 'Kurt Stern' was one of the best features of the album and The Times expressed surprise that these \"'amusing interludes' between tracks are actually funny\", however Pitchfork Media found that 'Stern' \"gets in the way more than he helps\" and claimed that, by the time the listener had heard the full album he or she would \"likely consider redubbing it without ['Stern's'] contributions\". Reviewing Phantom Phorce for DiSCORDER magazine, Jordie Yow called it \"good, but not exceptional\" and claimed that the remixes simply made him want to listen to the original versions of the tracks while website Angry Ape was scathing, calling the album a \"bland & uninspiring package to put you off remixes for life\" and suggested that it was merely a \"cash-in\" by the band.\n\nParagraph 7: President Paul Deschanel's massive margin of victory in the presidential election of 17 January 1920 was almost without precedent.   Behind the scenes all was not well, however.   At 23.15 on 23 May 1920, travelling on the presidential train to Montbrison, where he was scheduled to unveil a statue to a war hero the next day, the president felt short of breath.   He got out of bed, went to the carriage window which he opened wide, leaned out and fell through it.   The train had reached a section of track that was being repaired, and was therefore travelling at only around 50 km/h (30 mph):  Deschanel was shaken by the fall, but his physical injuries were only superficial.   Andr\u00e9 Radeau, the railway worker responsible for the stretch of track beside which he had landed, viewed with scepticism the assertion of this elderly confused gentleman in pyjamas that he was the President of France.   Assuming that he had found a lost drunkard who had strayed from the usual path home, Radeau took the man to the home nearby of Gustave Dariot, the level-crossing keeper, who was impressed by Deschanel's dignified bearing and the coherence of his explanations:  the president was put lie down in order that he might, during what remained of the night, recover from his ordeal.   The wife of the level crossing keeper could see that their guest was no run-of-the-mill lost soul.   The pyjamas the old man wore were of good quality and, as she later explained to journalists, \"I could see that he was a proper gentleman:  he had clean feet!\"   Early next morning train staff noticed that the president was missing.   A presidential reception committee headed up by Interior Minister Th\u00e9odore Steeg endured a long wait without news on the platform at Roanne station.   Eventually a message arrived from the local sub-prefect at Montargis, close to where the president's mishap had taken place, explaining in outline what had happened.   A few hours later it was the president himself who telephoned the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace with the necessary reassurances.   Two days after that, Paul Deschanel presided in person at a cabinet meeting.   The government issued a statement seeking to play down the incident.   Nevertheless, the story proved irresistible: press coverage was extensive.  Printed cartoons and hastily adapted popular songs in the music halls were far from respectful.\n\nParagraph 8: The label established Riley as one of the major country female vocalists of the late 1960s and early 1970s with a string of hits for the label and also topping the Billboard country album chart with the Harper Valley PTA album. Grand Ole Opry star Ray Pillow had light success on the label with one top 40 country hit in 1969. David Allan Coe's first two albums were on the Plantation label; Penitentiary Blues and Requiem for a Harlequin, before moving on to a major recording career at Columbia Records. Linda Martell became the first African-American female vocalist to record specifically for the country market, enjoying two top 40 country hits on Plantation in 1969\u201370 including the second hit version of \"Before The Next Teardrop Falls\" which peaked at No. 33. Martell later left the label citing her belief that Singleton's choosing of the name Plantation Records was racist (although he denied this) and his decision to focus on Riley's career at the expense of hers. Additionally, she explained that, when she attempted to sign to other record labels, something that was permitted as she had fulfilled her one year contract with Plantation, Singleton threatened to sue the record companies, causing her to be blackballed from country music and forcing her into complete retirement from the music industry. Other artists on Plantation included Harlow Wilcox and Dee Mullins.\n\nParagraph 9: Champsosaurus was the first member of the Choristodera to be described. Champsosaurus was named by Edward Drinker Cope in 1876, from isolated vertebrae found in Late Cretaceous strata of the Judith River Formation on the banks of the Judith River in Fergus County, Montana. Cope designated C. annectens as the type species rather than the first named C. profundus due to the larger number of vertebrae he attributed to the species. C. annectens was based on 9 isolated vertebral centra (AMNH FR 5696) that were not figured in the paper of which two are now lost. Cope named several other species between 1876 and 1882, also based on isolated vertebrae. Barnum Brown in 1905 described the first complete remains of Champsosaurus, and noted that one of the species attributed to Champsosaurus by Cope in 1876, C. vaccinsulensis actually represented indeterminate plesiosaur remains, and that the vertebrae that Cope used to diagnose his species of Champsosaurus were heavily eroded and the diagnostic features varied substantially along the spinal column, and were not diagnostic to species level, including the remains that Cope attributed to the type species C. annectens. The conclusion that C. annectens was undiagnostic was supported by William Parks in 1933.\n\nParagraph 10: Many Arab-Jewish immigrants have settled in New York City and formed a Sephardi community. The community is centered in Brooklyn and is primarily composed of Syrian Jews. Other Arab Jews in New York City hail from Egypt, Israel, Lebanon, and Morocco. Arab Jews first began arriving in New York City in large numbers between 1880 and 1924. Most Arab immigrants during these years were Christian, while Arab Jews were a minority and Arab Muslims largely began migrating during the mid-1960s. When Syrian Jews first began to arrive in New York City during the late 1800s and early 1900s, Eastern European Ashkenazi Jews on the Lower East Side sometimes disdained their Syrian co-coreligionists as Arabische Yidden, Yiddish for \"Arab Jews\". Some Ashkenazim doubted whether Sephardi/Mizrahi Jews from the Middle East were Jewish at all. In response, some Syrian Jews who were deeply proud of their ancient Jewish heritage, derogatorily dubbed Ashkenazi Jews as \"J-Dubs\", a reference to the first and third letters of the English word \"Jew\". In the 1990 United States Census, there were 11,610 Arab Jews in New York City, comprising 23 percent of the total Arab population of the city. Arab Jews in the city sometimes still face anti-Arab racism. After the September 11 attacks, some Arab Jews in New York City were subjected to arrest and detention because they were suspected to be Islamist terrorists.\n\nParagraph 11: The award was first presented at the conclusion of the , and was named in honor of former Detroit Red Wings, Buffalo Sabres and Washington Capitals goaltender Roger Crozier, a Calder and Conn Smythe Trophy winner who played in the NHL from 1964 to 1977.  It was presented by the MBNA corporation in memory of Crozier, who worked for the MBNA America Bank after retiring as a player, and died on January 11, 1996.  The winner of the trophy received a commemorative crystal trophy and was given US$25,000 to donate to a youth hockey or other educational program of their choice.\n\nParagraph 12: He was appointed manager of Tyrone club Clonoe O'Rahilly's in January 2008. He successfully guided the club to success in the 2008 Tyrone Championship, the club's first title since 1991. They shocked the \"big two\"  of Tyrone club football \u2013 Errigal Ciar\u00e1n and Carrickmore in the first round and quarter-final respectively. Clonoe then defeated Donaghmore to progress to their first Championship final in 17 years. They faced defending champions Dromore in the final, who went in as red-hot favourites. However, Clonoe beat Dromore by a point after extra time. The feat is all the more remarkable, considering Clonoe are a very young team and have no Tyrone county players on the team. They were however beaten by St Eunan's of Donegal in the quarter-final of the 2008 Ulster Club Championship. Cassidy was reappointed manager of Clonoe O'Rahilly's in 2011, where he guided them back into the Tyrone championship final against Dromore, a repeat of the 2008 final, this time Dromore got their revenge winning by a point. In 2012 he guided Clonoe to their first All County Senior League title, defeating Coalisland in the final. In 2013 he once more lead Clonoe O' Rahilly's to senior championship success, beating Carrickmore in the final. He quickly followed this up with winning the U21 county title and then the Ulster U21 championship with Clonoe, defeating Truagh Gaels of Monaghan. 2015 the O' Rahilly's recaptured the All County Senior League title for the second time in their history under Cassidy's stewardship. Cassidy became manager of Erin's Own Cargin in County Antrim in 2018. Winning the senior championship at his first attempt, beating St Galls in a pulsating high scoring semi-final and then beating parish neighbours Creggan, where the rivalry is intense, in a low scoring championship final. In the same season, Cassidy also lead Wolfe Tones, Bellaghy to their first minor championship win since 1994, by beating close rivals Lavey Gac in the Derry minor championship final at Derry GAA Centre of Excellence, Owenbeg. He followed this up by leading the 'Tones' to the Ulster minor club championship, hosted by Belfast club St Pauls on New Years Day, by heavily defeating Crossmaglen Rangers Gac in the final. Cassidy won his second senior club championship with Cargin in 2019 by beating Lamh Dhearg in a final replay and then extra time in a pulsating final. He also won the All County senior league title to do the double. In 2020 in the year of the Covid virus, he led Erin's Own Cargin to their first historic three in a row, by again defeating Creggan in extra time in a classic high scoring game.\n\nParagraph 13: Once the homologation models were produced, a second version named Turbo\u00a02 was introduced using more stock Renault 5 parts replacing many of the light-alloy components in the original 5 Turbo version, and dropping the specific Bertone seats and dashboard for the interior of the R5 Alpine. Many parts also became dark grey rather than the iconic red or blue. The Turbo\u00a02 was less expensive, but had nearly the same levels of performance, with a top speed of  and 0\u2013100 km/h (62 mph) in 6.9 seconds. To differentiate it from the Turbo\u00a02, the original 5 Turbo is often referred as \"Turbo\u00a01\".\n\nThe following is an abstract.\n\nThe Cahora Bassa dam in Mozambique was constructed by the Portuguese colonial government in 1969 and filled in 1974. Native people protested against the dam as it required them to give up their land. During the Mozambican Civil War, the power transmission lines were sabotaged, causing disruptions. The lake created by the dam flooded a large area and is mostly owned by the Portuguese government. The dam was built to provide electricity to South Africa, causing hardships for the displaced natives. The region has also seen a decrease in rainfall, which may lead to the shutdown of some or all of the turbines, affecting energy supply to South Africa. During the shutdown, alternative methods like using accumulators or pumping water into a reservoir are employed to generate electricity.\n\nPlease enter the number of the paragraph that the abstract is from.

They lost in the first round the following season to Revelstoke. But in 2005-06, the Eagles won the league title for a third time, defeating Beaver Valley in the final again. The Eagles have yet to win another league title. The 2006-07 Eagles suffered a considerable drop in form, finishing fourth in the Okanagan-Shushwap Division, and losing in the first round to the Kamloops Storm. The following year, the divisions of the KIJHL were re-organized, and the Eagles were moved to the Eddie Mountain Conference, East Division. They finished second in their division, but lost in the Division finals to the Revelstoke Grizzlies. In 2008-09, the league was again re-sorted, and the Eagles finished second in the new Okanagan Division. They would lose in the first round to Kamloops. The following season, they finished third in the Okanagan Division, before losing in the second round to the Princeton Posse. In 2010-11, the Eagles were sorted into the new Doug Birks Division, and finished third again, losing to Kamloops in the first round.

The next season would see an identical result, with the Eagles fourth and losing 4-1 to Kamloops, and this marked the first time in franchise history that the Eagles lost in the first round of the playoffs in two consecutive years. Another franchise low occurred in 2015-16, as the Eagles missed the playoffs for the first time in their history, compiling a 10-34-2-6 record, fifth in the Doug Birks Division.\n\nParagraph 2: The population of Lansingburgh is composed largely of persons whose business is located in Troy, but the village sustains several manufacturing concerns which contribute greatly to its wealth and prosperity. Even while Troy was yet a comparatively small village Lansingburgh enjoyed an immense trade with Vermont and Northern New York in grain, beef, pork, butter, cheese and other produce. There were many commission merchants or \"middle-men\" in the village. In the beginning of the 19th century there were at least a dozen warehouses on River street for storing grain. Lansingburgh was then the centre of a great grain trade, buying of the farmers for many miles around and selling at Albany, New York and other cities. About 1825, and even before that date, there were several leather tanneries in operation in the village. Frederick Forsyth, Keating Rawson, Cornelius Lansing, Asa Burt and William Guest owned the most important of these. There were also a number of slaughter and packing houses, among them being those of Ives & Wilson, Tobias Loring, Noel Atwood and Thomas Turner. Before the year 1800 there were four or five \"ship yards\" in town, where sailing vessels for navigation on the Hudson were made. Armington & Hawkins and John Stilson were prominent in this line. The oilcloth industry has been a prominent one for many years. Reference to the factory of D. Powers's Sons has been made in preceding pages. P. C. Davenport, Jonathan E. Whipple and Ferrin engaged in the business at an early day. Caswell's rifle factory began business about 1812 or 1813. Twentyfive men were employed for many years in the three shops. Brush manufacturing was also an early industry, David McMurray being the pioneer in the business. All of his five sons-William, John G., Robert, David and Moses-were engaged in the same business. Large numbers of persons were employed in the various works for many years.\n\nParagraph 3: Romani dishes are usually made hot and spicy with the use of spices, such as paprika, garlic and bell peppers. Potatoes are also a staple in their diet. A traditional Romani dessert is pirogo, which is similar to Jewish kugel. The recipe consists of eggs, raisins, walnuts, pineapple, sugar, butter, egg noodles and cottage cheese. Another traditional dish cooked by Romani people is sarma, salmaia or sodmay, which is made from cabbage stuffed with meat and rice. Romani people consume dishes consisting of stuffed peppers, especially on holidays and special occasions. Romani people also cook pufe (made from fried flour), xaritsa (fried cornbread), bogacha (baked bread) and xaimoko (a meal consisting of rabbit meat). They serve their meals with kafa (coffee) and chao (tea) with sugar and milk or fruits such as strawberries, peach slices, apple slices, or lemon.

C. annectens was based on 9 isolated vertebral centra (AMNH FR 5696) that were not figured in the paper of which two are now lost. Cope named several other species between 1876 and 1882, also based on isolated vertebrae. Barnum Brown in 1905 described the first complete remains of Champsosaurus, and noted that one of the species attributed to Champsosaurus by Cope in 1876, C. vaccinsulensis actually represented indeterminate plesiosaur remains, and that the vertebrae that Cope used to diagnose his species of Champsosaurus were heavily eroded and the diagnostic features varied substantially along the spinal column, and were not diagnostic to species level, including the remains that Cope attributed to the type species C. annectens. The conclusion that C. annectens was undiagnostic was supported by William Parks in 1933.\n\nParagraph 10: Many Arab-Jewish immigrants have settled in New York City and formed a Sephardi community. The community is centered in Brooklyn and is primarily composed of Syrian Jews. Other Arab Jews in New York City hail from Egypt, Israel, Lebanon, and Morocco. Arab Jews first began arriving in New York City in large numbers between 1880 and 1924. Most Arab immigrants during these years were Christian, while Arab Jews were a minority and Arab Muslims largely began migrating during the mid-1960s. When Syrian Jews first began to arrive in New York City during the late 1800s and early 1900s, Eastern European Ashkenazi Jews on the Lower East Side sometimes disdained their Syrian co-coreligionists as Arabische Yidden, Yiddish for \"Arab Jews\". Some Ashkenazim doubted whether Sephardi/Mizrahi Jews from the Middle East were Jewish at all. In response, some Syrian Jews who were deeply proud of their ancient Jewish heritage, derogatorily dubbed Ashkenazi Jews as \"J-Dubs\", a reference to the first and third letters of the English word \"Jew\". In the 1990 United States Census, there were 11,610 Arab Jews in New York City, comprising 23 percent of the total Arab population of the city. Arab Jews in the city sometimes still face anti-Arab racism. After the September 11 attacks, some Arab Jews in New York City were subjected to arrest and detention because they were suspected to be Islamist terrorists.\n\nParagraph 11: The award was first presented at the conclusion of the , and was named in honor of former Detroit Red Wings, Buffalo Sabres and Washington Capitals goaltender Roger Crozier, a Calder and Conn Smythe Trophy winner who played in the NHL from 1964 to 1977.  It was presented by the MBNA corporation in memory of Crozier, who worked for the MBNA America Bank after retiring as a player, and died on January 11, 1996.  The winner of the trophy received a commemorative crystal trophy and was given US$25,000 to donate to a youth hockey or other educational program of their choice.\n\nParagraph 12: He was appointed manager of Tyrone club Clonoe O'Rahilly's in January 2008. He successfully guided the club to success in the 2008 Tyrone Championship, the club's first title since 1991. They shocked the \"big two\"  of Tyrone club football \u2013 Errigal Ciar\u00e1n and Carrickmore in the first round and quarter-final respectively. Clonoe then defeated Donaghmore to progress to their first Championship final in 17 years. They faced defending champions Dromore in the final, who went in as red-hot favourites. However, Clonoe beat Dromore by a point after extra time. The feat is all the more remarkable, considering Clonoe are a very young team and have no Tyrone county players on the team. They were however beaten by St Eunan's of Donegal in the quarter-final of the 2008 Ulster Club Championship. Cassidy was reappointed manager of Clonoe O'Rahilly's in 2011, where he guided them back into the Tyrone championship final against Dromore, a repeat of the 2008 final, this time Dromore got their revenge winning by a point. In 2012 he guided Clonoe to their first All County Senior League title, defeating Coalisland in the final. In 2013 he once more lead Clonoe O' Rahilly's to senior championship success, beating Carrickmore in the final. He quickly followed this up with winning the U21 county title and then the Ulster U21 championship with Clonoe, defeating Truagh Gaels of Monaghan. 2015 the O' Rahilly's recaptured the All County Senior League title for the second time in their history under Cassidy's stewardship. Cassidy became manager of Erin's Own Cargin in County Antrim in 2018. Winning the senior championship at his first attempt, beating St Galls in a pulsating high scoring semi-final and then beating parish neighbours Creggan, where the rivalry is intense, in a low scoring championship final. In the same season, Cassidy also lead Wolfe Tones, Bellaghy to their first minor championship win since 1994, by beating close rivals Lavey Gac in the Derry minor championship final at Derry GAA Centre of Excellence, Owenbeg. He followed this up by leading the 'Tones' to the Ulster minor club championship, hosted by Belfast club St Pauls on New Years Day, by heavily defeating Crossmaglen Rangers Gac in the final. Cassidy won his second senior club championship with Cargin in 2019 by beating Lamh Dhearg in a final replay and then extra time in a pulsating final. He also won the All County senior league title to do the double. In 2020 in the year of the Covid virus, he led Erin's Own Cargin to their first historic three in a row, by again defeating Creggan in extra time in a classic high scoring game.\n\nParagraph 13: Once the homologation models were produced, a second version named Turbo\u00a02 was introduced using more stock Renault 5 parts replacing many of the light-alloy components in the original 5 Turbo version, and dropping the specific Bertone seats and dashboard for the interior of the R5 Alpine. Many parts also became dark grey rather than the iconic red or blue. The Turbo\u00a02 was less expensive, but had nearly the same levels of performance, with a top speed of  and 0\u2013100 km/h (62 mph) in 6.9 seconds. To differentiate it from the Turbo\u00a02, the original 5 Turbo is often referred as \"Turbo\u00a01\".", "answers": ["Paragraph 5"], "length": 3728, "dataset": "passage_retrieval_en_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "f188797ab3b6f303be0812325eba96240df0d516abfb1082", "pred": "5\n\nPlease let me know if I'm correct or not.

Please determine which paragraph the abstract is from.\n\nParagraph 1: The game was originally titled Star Wars: Podracer, however the subtitle was changed to Episode I Racer when LucasArts learned that another company owned the trademark for games with the name \"Pod\" in the title. Actor Jake Lloyd, who portrayed Anakin Skywalker in Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace, promoted the game at E3 1999. Lloyd also provided voice-over for his character in the game. The theatrical score from Star Wars: Episode I \u2013 The Phantom Menace was reused for the game, and various sound effects from the film were also reused. The podracers were recreated using specifications from the film, and the Tatooine environment was also sourced from the film. Several of the game's other locales had never appeared in a Star Wars game prior. The varied environments, Tosti said, were \"to add more depth to the gameplay.\" During an IGN interview with LucasArts' Tom Byron at E3 1999 the question of online play was brought up. Byron was unsure, citing problems \"mostly because of latency issues.\" Some multiplayer code from Star Wars Jedi Knight: Dark Forces II was utilized for Episode I: Racer. Ultimately internet play was not included. The Windows version uses the deprecated IPX protocol to accomplish this, while the Macintosh version uses the TCP/IP stack. The multiplayer mode can support up to eight players. The game was supported by a 10 million marketing budget.Episode I: Racer was later ported and released for several other platforms: Nintendo 64 Dreamcast, and Game Boy Color. The announced PlayStation version of the game was never released. The Nintendo 64 version received a special edition Star Wars Episode I: Racer hardware bundle, including the standard gray and black console and a copy of the game. Though the Nintendo 64 cartridge could optionally take advantage of Nintendo's Expansion Pak memory unit to display additional textures, the limited capacity of the cartridge resulted in the removal of all pre-rendered cutscenes seen on the Windows and Macintosh versions. It was the first LucasArts game to be released on the Dreamcast. The Game Boy Color release features entirely different game play from its console and PC counterparts. The Game Boy Color hardware is technically incapable of rendering the 3D graphics used in the other versions, so the game instead features one-on-one racing duels on abbreviated, linear tracks using an overhead 2D view. The Game Boy Color version of the game has an additional \"rumble\" feature, in which a AAA battery may be inserted into the game card to activate vibration.\n\nParagraph 2: Route\u00a02 begins as a continuation of State Street (just east of Columbus Blvd) near Interstate\u00a091 in downtown Hartford. It starts out heading east toward East Hartford. Route\u00a02 then crosses the Connecticut River on the Founders Bridge and has a partial interchange with I-91 at the crossing. Immediately after crossing into East Hartford, there is a complex interchange with Interstate\u00a084. Immediately after this interchange, Route\u00a02 heads southeast in the direction of Glastonbury. There is a partial interchange with Route\u00a015 about  further. After East Hartford, Route\u00a02 enters Glastonbury. At the East Hartford-Glastonbury town line, there is a full trumpet interchange with Route 3. About  after this interchange, there is a partial interchange with Route\u00a017. From Glastonbury, Route\u00a02 passes into Marlborough. It continues into Colchester. In Colchester, Route\u00a02 has a partial interchange with Route\u00a011. After this interchange, Route\u00a02 curves and heads east toward Norwich. Once Route 2 leaves Colchester, it passes through the towns of Lebanon and Bozrah. After Bozrah, Route\u00a02 enters Norwich. Just after entering Norwich, Route\u00a032 joins Route\u00a02. Then, about  down Route\u00a02, there is a partial cloverleaf interchange with Interstate\u00a0395. About  further east from the I-395 interchange, the limited-access highway section of Route\u00a02 ends at a four-way at-grade intersection with Town Street, Harland Road (Route\u00a0169), and Washington Street (Route\u00a032/Route\u00a02). Route\u00a032 then separates in downtown Norwich after overlapping with Route\u00a02 for , following the west bank of the Thames River. Route\u00a02 continues southeast from Norwich into Preston, and then into Ledyard. Just after entering Ledyard, Route\u00a02 passes by the Mashantucket Pequot Reservation and then the Foxwoods Resort Casino. After passing through Ledyard, Route\u00a02 continues into North Stonington. There is a roundabout with Route\u00a0184 and a partial interchange with Interstate\u00a095 here. After leaving North Stonington, Route\u00a02 heads into Stonington. Here, Route\u00a02 is reduced to a minor arterial road. It has an interchange with Route\u00a078 (Westerly Bypass) and terminates about  later at the junction with US\u00a01 in the Pawcatuck section of town just west of the Rhode Island state line.\n\nParagraph 3: Shafer was born in New Castle, Pennsylvania and spent his childhood in Meadville. He graduated from Allegheny College in 1938 and Yale Law School in 1941. Following brief stints practicing law in New York City and Meadville and United States Navy service as an intelligence officer and on PT boats during World War II, Shafer entered politics as a district attorney in 1948 and then as a state senator. He was elected lieutenant governor in 1962, under Governor Bill Scranton. Shafer was active in that role and succeeded the term-limited Scranton as governor in the 1966 election. Shafer became a prominent voice among moderate Republicans and oversaw constitutional reforms in Pennsylvania, the formation of the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation, expenditures for health and education programs, and proposed a state income tax, which proved unpopular but was later enacted by his successor, Milton Shapp.\n\nParagraph 4: In Reward, when Johnny was angry at Tracy when he overheard that she couldn't think of anything good besides good at cleaning at an annual awards for kids in care. Him and Elektra decided to distract Tracy, and edit the certificates to everyone by telling everyone what Mike, Gina and Tracy really think of the kids by reading everyone's files. Carmen is described as needy, weedy and greedy for attention. Tracy then comes in to find Johnny and Elektra reading out their versions of certificates, she tells them to stop but Johnny decides to read out Tyler's \"award\" for wetting the bed all the time. Johnny and Elektra find this amusing, but Tyler gets upset, pushes Johnny and storms off to his room. Tracy and Rick try to convince Tyler that it's not a big deal, and that everyone at some point in their life has wet the bed. When Tyler comes back downstairs, Gus starts asking everyone if they have wet the bed. When he asks Rick, Rick says it's Tyler's fault. Because when Tyler and Rick first moved into the Dumping Ground, Rick found out Tyler wets the bed. So Tyler decided to make Rick wet the bed one night by putting his hand in a bucket of cold water in the night, that can cause you to wet the bed and would threaten to tell everyone Rick wets the bed, if Rick said anything to anyone about Tyler wetting the bed. Rick then goes on to say that he wouldn't of said anything in the first place. Before everyone set off to go to the awards, Tee apologised to Tyler about Johnny's behaviour towards Tyler. Tyler told Tee and Harry about the dream he always has before he wets the bed; and that he's with his mum, saying that she wishes a big wave would come and wash all the bad stuff away. Tyler thinks that she meant that a big wave would come and wash him away too, and then there's a big wave coming towards him really fast. Then he wakes up and he's wet the bed. Later after the awards ceremony, Johnny apologises to Tyler himself and Tyler forgives him. Harry then comes and suggests to Tyler that in his dream before the big wave comes that makes him wet the bed, that he should build a boat so he doesn't get wet. When he goes to bed and has the dream, he dreams he built a boat so he doesn't get washed away and then he wakes up and finds that he hasn't wet the bed. Tyler then decides to get his own back on Johnny for making fun of him for wetting the bed, by putting a bucket of cold water by his (Johnny's) bed and putting his hand in the water so he would wet the bed. The episode ended there so we didn't get to see Johnny's reaction to Tyler's prank.\n\nParagraph 5: Estrada began training for his professional wrestling career in the nearby town of Villahermosa, Tabasco training under Indio Azteca, Maciste, El Remington I and El Chacal for his professional wrestling career. While training for a professional wrestling career he also learned the basics of Olympic style wrestling and also competed in bodybuilding competitions. His in-ring debut came about earlier than expected as a local wrestling promoted asked Estrada to fill in for a wrestler who could not make that night's show. He made his debut that night working as the enmascarado (Masked wrestler) El Universitario (\"The Academic\" or College Student), a name that reflected that he was still in wrestling school. As Universitario he teamed up with \u00c1ngel Azul and fought against the team of El Profeta and El Chilango Garcia. Later when he was ready to make his full-time debut Estrada bought a spare mask, boots and tights from \u00c1ngel Azul and began working as Pr\u00edncipe Azul (\"The Blue Prince\"). As Pr\u00edncipe Azul he found a lot of initial success, combining his mat skills with his very muscular physique, something less common in those days and ended up unmasking Ultratumba after defeating him in a Luchas de Apuestas, or bet match and later on would also force Ultratumba to be shaved bald. Later on he also won the hair of El Noruego as well. His early success as Pr\u00edncipe Azul led to him being named the Villahermosa rookie of the year in 1972. In early 1973 Estrada decided he needed a new image, a unique image not based on the mask of his former partner. Inspired by the Mayan Indian warrior leader Jacinto Canek came up with the name of \"El Canek\", complete with a redesigned mask and tights that incorporated mayana patterns and symbols. He worked his first match as \"El Canek\" (billed as \"Kanek\" for that one match only) in the Torero de Quatro Caminos (\"The Four Cornered Bullfighting Ring\") in Naucalpan, Mexican State, an arena he would sell out repeatedly later in his career.\n\nParagraph 6: Walcott was born on March 13, 1873, in British Guiana but migrated to Barbados at a young age. As a youngster he set out to see the world and got a job as a cabin boy on a ship sailing to Boston that arrived around 1887. He soon settled in Boston as a piano mover and porter and took other odd jobs as well. Later, he landed a job in a gym and became popular with even the best of the boxers as an able opponent before turning professional. His amateur boxing and wrestling years spanned roughly from 1887 to 1889.\n\nParagraph 7: Kyalami Grand Prix Circuit (from Khaya lami, My home in Zulu) is a  motor racing circuit located in Midrand, Gauteng, South Africa, just north of Johannesburg. The circuit has been used for Grand Prix and Formula One races and has hosted the South African Grand Prix twenty times. Among the Formula One races held at the track the 1977 South African Grand Prix stands out, as it is principally remembered for the fatal accident that claimed the lives of race marshal Frederick Jansen van Vuuren and driver Tom Pryce. In recent years, the area surrounding the circuit has developed into a residential and commercial suburb of Johannesburg. More recently, Kyalami has played host to five rounds of the Superbike World Championship from 1998 to 2002 and later in 2009 and 2010, the season finale of the Superstars Series in 2009 and 2010, and the South African round of the 2008\u201309 A1 Grand Prix season. International racing returned to the circuit in November 2019, when it hosted the 2019 Kyalami 9 Hours, serving as the season finale of the 2019 Intercontinental GT Challenge.\n\nParagraph 8: Meanwhile, Raj and Priya come to Goa, where they run into a drunkard loitering near the mansion. The drunkard runs away on seeing them. On seeing the state of the house, they realise that Sonia has been robbed, but are later horrified to see Sonia dead. The duo run, but find that the child is left inside the mansion. Raj enters the mansion again to take him. He sees two eyes and legs of the killer behind a cupboard. Terrified, he gets out of the mansion with the child. Raj and Priya then inform Goa police about the murder. They keep the child inside a police van and run away. But Priya finds that she has left her suitcase inside the mansion inside which her passport is kept. Meanwhile, audience watch that Sonia's body is kept inside Priya's suitcase by somebody and kept outside the mansion. KK reaches the mansion and finds the suitcase. Thinking that it is containing lot of money, he takes it and reaches his room in hotel where Ruby is waiting for him. Meanwhile, Raj and Priya go back to the mansion to take her suitcase. Raj enters the mansion, but is arrested by Inspector Karan, the investigating officer and Ravi. Raj refuses to name Priya and it warms her heart as she watches on. Meanwhile, KK and Ruby find out that the suitcase contains a dead body, not money. They decide to dispose of the suitcase. Meanwhile, Priya takes Vicky to a church to drop him off but is seen by Rocky with the kid. As it was on the news to inform cops about a young girl with a kid, Rocky calls the police. Priya, who had wanted to help Raj, instead gets arrested and sent to jail. Priya and Raj become the prime suspects of the murder. Inside the jail, both fall for each other.\n\nParagraph 9: David was the son of baronet John Hans Makel\u00e9er (1604-1666). His mother was Anna Gubbertz (c.1595-1653) sometimes referred to as Anna Quickelberg. Anna was the daughter of Hans Gubbertz (c1570-?) and Maichen Maria von Quickelberg (1582-1646). David Makel\u00e9er had the following siblings: Carl Leonard Makel\u00e9er (1633-1663); Catharina Makel\u00e9er (1637-1709); Anna Makel\u00e9er (1638-1646); Lunetta Makel\u00e9er (1639-1693) who married Joakim Cronman (c1630-1703), a soldier who died at Neum\u00fcnde; Gustaf Adolf Makel\u00e9er (1641-1706) who was a Captain in the Swedish Army who married Sara Carlberg (1647-1701); and Elsa Beata Makel\u00e9er (1643-1730). He married Eleonora Elisabet von Ascheberg (1663-1737) in 1679, she was the daughter of Field Marshal Rutger von Ascheberg, Count of S\u00f6fdeborg. David then served as the first governor of \u00c4lvsborg County, Sweden from 1693 to 1708.\n\nParagraph 10: Jon Silkin was born in London, in a Litvak Jewish family, his parents were Joseph Silkin and Doris Rubenstein. His grandparents were all from the Lithuanian- part of the Russian Empire. His uncle was Lewis Silkin, 1st Baron Silkin. He was named Jon after Jon Forsyte in The Forsyte Saga, and attended Wycliffe College and Dulwich College During the Second World War he was one of the children evacuated from London (in his case, to Wales); he remembered that he \"roamed the countryside incessantly\" while in Wales, collecting \"fool's gold\" and exploring old Roman mines. For a period of about six years in the 1950s, after National Service, he supported himself by manual labour and other menial jobs. By 1956 he rented the top-floor flat at 10, Compayne Gardens, Hampstead, (), the house of Bernice Rubens, who later won the Booker Prize, and her husband Rudolf Nassauer, also a published novelist, later. Silkin, in turn, sublet rooms to, among others, David Mercer, later a prolific TV and West End dramatist, and Malcolm Ross-Macdonald, then a diploma student at the Slade and later a novelist; his first novel, The Big Waves (Cape, 1962) is a roman \u00e0 clef of life in that flat, in which Silkin features as Somes Arenstein. All three men lived by teaching English as a foreign language at the St Giles School of English in Oxford Street.\n\nParagraph 11: Fairfax has a strong band program, including a marching band which has won numerous championships. Included in the Rebel Band is the Fairfax High School Drumline, which placed third in the Atlantic Indoor Association (AIA) championships in North Carolina in 2006, third in 2010, and second in 2011.  In 2009, they performed in Dayton, Ohio for Winter Guard International and received 4th place in their preliminary group and 18th in semifinals.  Overall, they placed 18th out of 60 groups. Other teams that accompany the Band program are the Fall Guard (competes with the marching band) and the Winterguard (competes separately). The Fairfax High School Band was under the direction of Ms. Meghan Benson, and won second place at a band competition at the Smoky Mountain Music Festival, in Gatlinburg, Tennessee in the spring of 2008.  The Marching Band won third place in the local Fourth of July Parade independence Day celebration, and was awarded $2000 in 2008.  At the end of the 2008 Marching Rebel season the band received a 1- Superior rating at the VBODA Championships.  The Fairfax High School Band Program received a superior rating at both Marching and Symphonic Band festivals making it eligible to receive the award of Virginia State Honor Band for the first time in the school's 75-year history. The band has repeated the feat every year since. Because of the work of the Marching Band and Symphonic Band along with the work of the orchestral and choral departments, Fairfax was able to earn the title of Blue Ribbon School for the performing arts, which is achieved by Superior ratings at VBODA state marching festival, and a Superior rating for each of the top performing groups at District Festival.  At the competition on their spring trip in the year 2009 to Orlando, Florida, the Rebel band placed second in its class by a margin of less than one point and received the Silver Award Overall in Festival Disney.\n\nParagraph 12: The team tested and developed its own active suspension for the first time with the FW11B, specifically through Piquet and chief designer Frank Dernie, after Mansell declared no confidence in the system having experienced a different version of it on the Lotus 92 in  which led him to being disillusioned with the system. After much testing Piquet found the car to be superior to the conventionally suspended FW11B. The new suspension was an active suspension system similar to the one Lotus had been using all season on the Lotus 99T, but was renamed as Williams Reactive Ride due to the Lotus team having copyright on the 'Active Suspension' name for the system. The Williams engineered suspension was also lighter, less complicated and drew much less power from the Honda engine than did the Lotus example. The first time a hydraulic variant of the system was tested Dernie fitted it to a 1984 FW09, and during testing Piquet noted that although the car rode very smoothly, it handled very badly. So Dernie redesigned the system and hired Paddy Lowe and Steve Wise to design an electronic computerized system. In a race simulation test at the Imola circuit, driving a reactive suspension FW11B, Piquet completed 59 laps some 3 minutes faster than Mansell had done to win the Grand Prix at the circuit earlier in the year, though it was noted that he was also the only car on the circuit for the simulation and thus wasn't slowed by having to lap other cars. Still, his confidence in the new suspension was absolute and he first used it in competition at the Italian Grand Prix at Monza where it proved much faster than the passive suspension FW11B, allowing him to run with less wing and record the highest speed of the 1987 season when he was speed trapped at 218.807\u00a0mph (352.135\u00a0km/h), some 5\u00a0mph faster than Mansell could manage in the conventional suspension car. Piquet would start from the pole and win the race from the Lotus of Ayrton Senna, with Mansell unable to keep pace finishing 3rd. It took until the next race in Portugal before Mansell would try the reactive car during a Grand Prix weekend, although he only raced it during the Spanish Grand Prix at Jerez. There were also plans in 1987 to introduce a semi automatic transmission, but this never came to pass.\n\nThe following is an abstract.\n\nThe team tested and developed its own active suspension for the first time with the FW11B, after Mansell had a negative experience with a different version of the system.

In Colchester, Route\u00a02 has a partial interchange with Route\u00a011. After this interchange, Route\u00a02 curves and heads east toward Norwich. Once Route 2 leaves Colchester, it passes through the towns of Lebanon and Bozrah. After Bozrah, Route\u00a02 enters Norwich. Just after entering Norwich, Route\u00a032 joins Route\u00a02. Then, about  down Route\u00a02, there is a partial cloverleaf interchange with Interstate\u00a0395. About  further east from the I-395 interchange, the limited-access highway section of Route\u00a02 ends at a four-way at-grade intersection with Town Street, Harland Road (Route\u00a0169), and Washington Street (Route\u00a032/Route\u00a02). Route\u00a032 then separates in downtown Norwich after overlapping with Route\u00a02 for , following the west bank of the Thames River. Route\u00a02 continues southeast from Norwich into Preston, and then into Ledyard. Just after entering Ledyard, Route\u00a02 passes by the Mashantucket Pequot Reservation and then the Foxwoods Resort Casino. After passing through Ledyard, Route\u00a02 continues into North Stonington. There is a roundabout with Route\u00a0184 and a partial interchange with Interstate\u00a095 here. After leaving North Stonington, Route\u00a02 heads into Stonington. Here, Route\u00a02 is reduced to a minor arterial road. It has an interchange with Route\u00a078 (Westerly Bypass) and terminates about  later at the junction with US\u00a01 in the Pawcatuck section of town just west of the Rhode Island state line.\n\nParagraph 3: Shafer was born in New Castle, Pennsylvania and spent his childhood in Meadville. He graduated from Allegheny College in 1938 and Yale Law School in 1941. Following brief stints practicing law in New York City and Meadville and United States Navy service as an intelligence officer and on PT boats during World War II, Shafer entered politics as a district attorney in 1948 and then as a state senator. He was elected lieutenant governor in 1962, under Governor Bill Scranton. Shafer was active in that role and succeeded the term-limited Scranton as governor in the 1966 election. Shafer became a prominent voice among moderate Republicans and oversaw constitutional reforms in Pennsylvania, the formation of the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation, expenditures for health and education programs, and proposed a state income tax, which proved unpopular but was later enacted by his successor, Milton Shapp.\n\nParagraph 4: In Reward, when Johnny was angry at Tracy when he overheard that she couldn't think of anything good besides good at cleaning at an annual awards for kids in care. Him and Elektra decided to distract Tracy, and edit the certificates to everyone by telling everyone what Mike, Gina and Tracy really think of the kids by reading everyone's files. Carmen is described as needy, weedy and greedy for attention. Tracy then comes in to find Johnny and Elektra reading out their versions of certificates, she tells them to stop but Johnny decides to read out Tyler's \"award\" for wetting the bed all the time. Johnny and Elektra find this amusing, but Tyler gets upset, pushes Johnny and storms off to his room. Tracy and Rick try to convince Tyler that it's not a big deal, and that everyone at some point in their life has wet the bed. When Tyler comes back downstairs, Gus starts asking everyone if they have wet the bed. When he asks Rick, Rick says it's Tyler's fault. Because when Tyler and Rick first moved into the Dumping Ground, Rick found out Tyler wets the bed. So Tyler decided to make Rick wet the bed one night by putting his hand in a bucket of cold water in the night, that can cause you to wet the bed and would threaten to tell everyone Rick wets the bed, if Rick said anything to anyone about Tyler wetting the bed. Rick then goes on to say that he wouldn't of said anything in the first place. Before everyone set off to go to the awards, Tee apologised to Tyler about Johnny's behaviour towards Tyler. Tyler told Tee and Harry about the dream he always has before he wets the bed; and that he's with his mum, saying that she wishes a big wave would come and wash all the bad stuff away. Tyler thinks that she meant that a big wave would come and wash him away too, and then there's a big wave coming towards him really fast. Then he wakes up and he's wet the bed. Later after the awards ceremony, Johnny apologises to Tyler himself and Tyler forgives him. Harry then comes and suggests to Tyler that in his dream before the big wave comes that makes him wet the bed, that he should build a boat so he doesn't get wet. When he goes to bed and has the dream, he dreams he built a boat so he doesn't get washed away and then he wakes up and finds that he hasn't wet the bed. Tyler then decides to get his own back on Johnny for making fun of him for wetting the bed, by putting a bucket of cold water by his (Johnny's) bed and putting his hand in the water so he would wet the bed. The episode ended there so we didn't get to see Johnny's reaction to Tyler's prank.\n\nParagraph 5: Estrada began training for his professional wrestling career in the nearby town of Villahermosa, Tabasco training under Indio Azteca, Maciste, El Remington I and El Chacal for his professional wrestling career. While training for a professional wrestling career he also learned the basics of Olympic style wrestling and also competed in bodybuilding competitions. His in-ring debut came about earlier than expected as a local wrestling promoted asked Estrada to fill in for a wrestler who could not make that night's show. He made his debut that night working as the enmascarado (Masked wrestler) El Universitario (\"The Academic\" or College Student), a name that reflected that he was still in wrestling school. As Universitario he teamed up with \u00c1ngel Azul and fought against the team of El Profeta and El Chilango Garcia. Later when he was ready to make his full-time debut Estrada bought a spare mask, boots and tights from \u00c1ngel Azul and began working as Pr\u00edncipe Azul (\"The Blue Prince\"). As Pr\u00edncipe Azul he found a lot of initial success, combining his mat skills with his very muscular physique, something less common in those days and ended up unmasking Ultratumba after defeating him in a Luchas de Apuestas, or bet match and later on would also force Ultratumba to be shaved bald. Later on he also won the hair of El Noruego as well. His early success as Pr\u00edncipe Azul led to him being named the Villahermosa rookie of the year in 1972. In early 1973 Estrada decided he needed a new image, a unique image not based on the mask of his former partner. Inspired by the Mayan Indian warrior leader Jacinto Canek came up with the name of \"El Canek\", complete with a redesigned mask and tights that incorporated mayana patterns and symbols. He worked his first match as \"El Canek\" (billed as \"Kanek\" for that one match only) in the Torero de Quatro Caminos (\"The Four Cornered Bullfighting Ring\") in Naucalpan, Mexican State, an arena he would sell out repeatedly later in his career.\n\nParagraph 6: Walcott was born on March 13, 1873, in British Guiana but migrated to Barbados at a young age. As a youngster he set out to see the world and got a job as a cabin boy on a ship sailing to Boston that arrived around 1887. He soon settled in Boston as a piano mover and porter and took other odd jobs as well. Later, he landed a job in a gym and became popular with even the best of the boxers as an able opponent before turning professional. His amateur boxing and wrestling years spanned roughly from 1887 to 1889.\n\nParagraph 7: Kyalami Grand Prix Circuit (from Khaya lami, My home in Zulu) is a  motor racing circuit located in Midrand, Gauteng, South Africa, just north of Johannesburg. The circuit has been used for Grand Prix and Formula One races and has hosted the South African Grand Prix twenty times. Among the Formula One races held at the track the 1977 South African Grand Prix stands out, as it is principally remembered for the fatal accident that claimed the lives of race marshal Frederick Jansen van Vuuren and driver Tom Pryce. In recent years, the area surrounding the circuit has developed into a residential and commercial suburb of Johannesburg. More recently, Kyalami has played host to five rounds of the Superbike World Championship from 1998 to 2002 and later in 2009 and 2010, the season finale of the Superstars Series in 2009 and 2010, and the South African round of the 2008\u201309 A1 Grand Prix season. International racing returned to the circuit in November 2019, when it hosted the 2019 Kyalami 9 Hours, serving as the season finale of the 2019 Intercontinental GT Challenge.\n\nParagraph 8: Meanwhile, Raj and Priya come to Goa, where they run into a drunkard loitering near the mansion. The drunkard runs away on seeing them. On seeing the state of the house, they realise that Sonia has been robbed, but are later horrified to see Sonia dead. The duo run, but find that the child is left inside the mansion. Raj enters the mansion again to take him. He sees two eyes and legs of the killer behind a cupboard. Terrified, he gets out of the mansion with the child. Raj and Priya then inform Goa police about the murder. They keep the child inside a police van and run away. But Priya finds that she has left her suitcase inside the mansion inside which her passport is kept. Meanwhile, audience watch that Sonia's body is kept inside Priya's suitcase by somebody and kept outside the mansion. KK reaches the mansion and finds the suitcase. Thinking that it is containing lot of money, he takes it and reaches his room in hotel where Ruby is waiting for him. Meanwhile, Raj and Priya go back to the mansion to take her suitcase. Raj enters the mansion, but is arrested by Inspector Karan, the investigating officer and Ravi. Raj refuses to name Priya and it warms her heart as she watches on. Meanwhile, KK and Ruby find out that the suitcase contains a dead body, not money. They decide to dispose of the suitcase. Meanwhile, Priya takes Vicky to a church to drop him off but is seen by Rocky with the kid. As it was on the news to inform cops about a young girl with a kid, Rocky calls the police. Priya, who had wanted to help Raj, instead gets arrested and sent to jail. Priya and Raj become the prime suspects of the murder. Inside the jail, both fall for each other.\n\nParagraph 9: David was the son of baronet John Hans Makel\u00e9er (1604-1666). His mother was Anna Gubbertz (c.1595-1653) sometimes referred to as Anna Quickelberg. Anna was the daughter of Hans Gubbertz (c1570-?) and Maichen Maria von Quickelberg (1582-1646). David Makel\u00e9er had the following siblings: Carl Leonard Makel\u00e9er (1633-1663); Catharina Makel\u00e9er (1637-1709); Anna Makel\u00e9er (1638-1646); Lunetta Makel\u00e9er (1639-1693) who married Joakim Cronman (c1630-1703), a soldier who died at Neum\u00fcnde; Gustaf Adolf Makel\u00e9er (1641-1706) who was a Captain in the Swedish Army who married Sara Carlberg (1647-1701); and Elsa Beata Makel\u00e9er (1643-1730). He married Eleonora Elisabet von Ascheberg (1663-1737) in 1679, she was the daughter of Field Marshal Rutger von Ascheberg, Count of S\u00f6fdeborg. David then served as the first governor of \u00c4lvsborg County, Sweden from 1693 to 1708.\n\nParagraph 10: Jon Silkin was born in London, in a Litvak Jewish family, his parents were Joseph Silkin and Doris Rubenstein. His grandparents were all from the Lithuanian- part of the Russian Empire. His uncle was Lewis Silkin, 1st Baron Silkin. He was named Jon after Jon Forsyte in The Forsyte Saga, and attended Wycliffe College and Dulwich College During the Second World War he was one of the children evacuated from London (in his case, to Wales); he remembered that he \"roamed the countryside incessantly\" while in Wales, collecting \"fool's gold\" and exploring old Roman mines. For a period of about six years in the 1950s, after National Service, he supported himself by manual labour and other menial jobs. By 1956 he rented the top-floor flat at 10, Compayne Gardens, Hampstead, (), the house of Bernice Rubens, who later won the Booker Prize, and her husband Rudolf Nassauer, also a published novelist, later. Silkin, in turn, sublet rooms to, among others, David Mercer, later a prolific TV and West End dramatist, and Malcolm Ross-Macdonald, then a diploma student at the Slade and later a novelist; his first novel, The Big Waves (Cape, 1962) is a roman \u00e0 clef of life in that flat, in which Silkin features as Somes Arenstein. All three men lived by teaching English as a foreign language at the St Giles School of English in Oxford Street.\n\nParagraph 11: Fairfax has a strong band program, including a marching band which has won numerous championships. Included in the Rebel Band is the Fairfax High School Drumline, which placed third in the Atlantic Indoor Association (AIA) championships in North Carolina in 2006, third in 2010, and second in 2011.  In 2009, they performed in Dayton, Ohio for Winter Guard International and received 4th place in their preliminary group and 18th in semifinals.  Overall, they placed 18th out of 60 groups. Other teams that accompany the Band program are the Fall Guard (competes with the marching band) and the Winterguard (competes separately). The Fairfax High School Band was under the direction of Ms. Meghan Benson, and won second place at a band competition at the Smoky Mountain Music Festival, in Gatlinburg, Tennessee in the spring of 2008.  The Marching Band won third place in the local Fourth of July Parade independence Day celebration, and was awarded $2000 in 2008.  At the end of the 2008 Marching Rebel season the band received a 1- Superior rating at the VBODA Championships.  The Fairfax High School Band Program received a superior rating at both Marching and Symphonic Band festivals making it eligible to receive the award of Virginia State Honor Band for the first time in the school's 75-year history. The band has repeated the feat every year since. Because of the work of the Marching Band and Symphonic Band along with the work of the orchestral and choral departments, Fairfax was able to earn the title of Blue Ribbon School for the performing arts, which is achieved by Superior ratings at VBODA state marching festival, and a Superior rating for each of the top performing groups at District Festival.  At the competition on their spring trip in the year 2009 to Orlando, Florida, the Rebel band placed second in its class by a margin of less than one point and received the Silver Award Overall in Festival Disney.\n\nParagraph 12: The team tested and developed its own active suspension for the first time with the FW11B, specifically through Piquet and chief designer Frank Dernie, after Mansell declared no confidence in the system having experienced a different version of it on the Lotus 92 in  which led him to being disillusioned with the system. After much testing Piquet found the car to be superior to the conventionally suspended FW11B. The new suspension was an active suspension system similar to the one Lotus had been using all season on the Lotus 99T, but was renamed as Williams Reactive Ride due to the Lotus team having copyright on the 'Active Suspension' name for the system. The Williams engineered suspension was also lighter, less complicated and drew much less power from the Honda engine than did the Lotus example. The first time a hydraulic variant of the system was tested Dernie fitted it to a 1984 FW09, and during testing Piquet noted that although the car rode very smoothly, it handled very badly. So Dernie redesigned the system and hired Paddy Lowe and Steve Wise to design an electronic computerized system. In a race simulation test at the Imola circuit, driving a reactive suspension FW11B, Piquet completed 59 laps some 3 minutes faster than Mansell had done to win the Grand Prix at the circuit earlier in the year, though it was noted that he was also the only car on the circuit for the simulation and thus wasn't slowed by having to lap other cars. Still, his confidence in the new suspension was absolute and he first used it in competition at the Italian Grand Prix at Monza where it proved much faster than the passive suspension FW11B, allowing him to run with less wing and record the highest speed of the 1987 season when he was speed trapped at 218.807\u00a0mph (352.135\u00a0km/h), some 5\u00a0mph faster than Mansell could manage in the conventional suspension car. Piquet would start from the pole and win the race from the Lotus of Ayrton Senna, with Mansell unable to keep pace finishing 3rd. It took until the next race in Portugal before Mansell would try the reactive car during a Grand Prix weekend, although he only raced it during the Spanish Grand Prix at Jerez. There were also plans in 1987 to introduce a semi automatic transmission, but this never came to pass.", "answers": ["Paragraph 12"], "length": 3580, "dataset": "passage_retrieval_en_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "fefcad13768b159709cc708cc673812231936f33aaf5da15", "pred": "12."}
{"prompt": "Here are 30 paragraphs from Wikipedia, along with an abstract. Please determine which paragraph the abstract is from.\n\nParagraph 1: A typical forest tree breeding program starts with selection of superior phenotypes (plus trees) in a natural or planted forest, often based on growth rate, tree form and site adaptation traits. This application of mass selection improves the mean performance of the forest. Offspring is obtained from selected trees and grown in test plantations that act as genetic trials. Based on such tests the best genotypes among the parents can be selected. Selected trees are typically multiplied by either seeds or grafting and seed orchards are established when the preferred output is improved seed. Alternatively, the best genotypes can be directly propagated by cuttings or in-vitro methods and used directly in clonal plantations. The first system is frequently used in pines and other conifers, while the second is typical in some broadleaves (poplars, eucalypts and others). The objectives of a tree breeding program range from yield improvement and adaptation to particular conditions, to pest- and disease-resistance, wood properties, etc. Currently, tree breeding is starting to take advantage of the fast development in plant genetics and genomics.\n\nParagraph 2: James Berardinelli of ReelViews gave the film one out of four stars and wrote: \"This is a dreadful motion picture - a lowbrow example of period piece comedy with terrible production values and an exceptionally poor laughs-to-jokes ratio. There's a kind of desperation in the movie's approach to humor that reveals the film makers' uncertainty about how entertaining the material is; the manic style betrays itself as a last-ditch attempt to hide the flaws of a failed script.\"  Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly wrote: \"Almost Heroes [...] gives off the discomforting reek of desperation. ... How could director Christopher Guest [...] have reduced himself to staging gags such as Farley's slap-fest with hostile Injuns, Eugene Levy (as a nasty pirate) speaking in a zany French accent, or Farley stealing an egg from an eagle's nest, punching out the bird, and then falling to the ground with an epic thud? Almost Heroes goes thud too. Despite his compulsion to trash everything in his midst, including himself, Chris Farley deserved better.\"  John R. McEwen of Film Quips Online wrote: \"It's clear, his death notwithstanding, that Farley is the funniest thing about this... As expected, there is little here but sight gags and low humor, but if you're in the mood (and I must have been), it has its laugh-out-loud moments. ... Perry also has a few good bits, but he is obviously a distant second banana. Additional appearances by people like Eugene Levy and Kevin Dunn, and others, add to the hilarity, although many of the jokes fall flat...I doubt if anyone ever expected Chris Farley to win an Academy Award. But it is a fitting tribute to him that his last outing, while not a great work of American cinema, can provide a good dose of chuckles, and more than a few belly laughs.\"\n\nParagraph 3: Centers was born in Tyler, Texas and grew up in  Longview. He began playing little league football for the Bramlette Bears as a running back and quarterback during his elementary school years and went on to play in middle school for the Forest Park Eagles and high school for the Longview Lobos until his junior year. He played on both sides of the ball as a defensive back and runnningback and wide receiver. Centers did not play football at all his junior year of high school. After his family moved to nearby Tatum, where his mother was an administrator in education, Centers decided to play football again after being urged to do so by his elder brother. After a solid season in Tatum, he earned a scholarship to nearby Stephen F. Austin State University. He was also recruited by Baylor, Texas Tech, and several junior colleges. His brother, Donnie, played for the University of Arkansas and coach Lou Holtz as a wide receiver.\n\nParagraph 4: The new stadium took its name from the street which encloses the ground on three sides, the fourth boundary being the River Wensum. The name \"Carrow\" originally refers to the former Carrow Abbey that once stood on the riverside, its name in turn having possible Norse origins. In 1800, John Ridges, owner of the Carrow Abbey Estate and the land opposite on the banks of the Wensum in Thorpe Hamlet, \"granted permission for a proposed road access across his grounds to Carrow\". By 1811, Philip M. Martineau, a surgeon, owned the building, lands and manor of Carrow, including the adjacent Thorpe land. Carrow Hill Road was created on his Carrow Abbey Estate, to provide work for the poor in the community. The road linked Martineau's Bracondale Estate to Carrow Toll Bridge, installed in 1810. Norwich Railway Co. had acquired the land in Thorpe around Carrow Road by the 1840s, and by 1860 the Thorpe site of the future stadium belonged to the firm of J. & J. Colman. The stadium's Thorpe Corner acknowledges this historical link. In 1935, Colman's offered the 20-year leasehold to Norwich City and construction of the new stadium began swiftly on the site: tenders were issued on the day the site was purchased and ten days later, on 11 June, work began.\n\nParagraph 5: In 1972, Al-Farouk Sports Club held a ceremony in honor of Prince Khalid bin Faisal Al Saud on the occasion of his appointment as the governor of Asir. The ceremony was held at the club's headquarters and a number of matters which concern the club were discussed. One of the matters that were discussed was a name change proposed by the Prince to members of the club's board. It was unanimously agreed by members of the board and fans of the club to change the club's name to Al-Wadiea Sports Club. Al-Wadiea achieved promotion to the Saudi First Division for the first time in 1977. They spent two seasons in the First Division before being relegated to the regional leagues. In 1983, the club once again achieved promotion to the First Division and spent two seasons before being relegated at the end of the 1984\u201385 season. Al-Wadiea were once again promoted in 1994 before being relegated after a season. In 1999, the club changed their name from Al-Wadiea Sports Club to Abha Sports Club. That same year, the club was promoted to the Second Division under the guidance of Saad Saleh Al-Bishri as manager. A year later the club achieved promotion once again but this time to the First Division with the Algerian, Elias Bou Zaid, as manager. In 2005, Abha were promoted to the Pro League, the top tier of Saudi football, for the first time after finishing second in the 2004\u201305 season. The club were relegated after just a season in the top tier. Abha once again reached the Pro League after finishing second in the 2007\u201308 season. They were relegated after a season following their loss to Al-Raed in the relegation play-offs. Abha then spent six consecutive seasons in the Saudi First Division before getting relegated to the Second Division for the first time since 2000. On 4 May 2018, Abha defeated Al-Watani 2\u20131 on aggregate in the promotion play-offs to earn promotion to the second tier. On 30 April 2019, Abha were promoted to the top flight for the third time after a 2\u20132 draw away to Al-Nojoom. This was their second promotion in two seasons, becoming the sixth Saudi team to achieve this feat. On 11 May 2019, Abha won their first MS League title despite losing to Al-Qaisumah. The 2019\u201320 season was Abha's most successful season in the Pro League. They achieved their highest finish in the top flight after finishing ninth. The club also reached the semi-finals of the King Cup for the first time.\n\nParagraph 6: 99942 Apophis is a near-Earth asteroid and potentially hazardous asteroid with a diameter of  that caused a brief period of concern in December 2004 when initial observations indicated a probability up to 2.7% that it would hit Earth on April\u00a013, 2029. Additional observations provided improved predictions that eliminated the possibility of an impact on Earth in 2029. Until 2006 a small probability nevertheless remained that, during its 2029 close encounter with Earth, Apophis would pass through a gravitational keyhole of no more than about  in diameter, which would have set up a future impact exactly seven years later on April\u00a013, 2036. This possibility kept it at Level\u00a01 on the Torino impact hazard scale until August 2006, when the probability that Apophis would pass through the keyhole was determined to be very small and Apophis' rating on the Torino scale was lowered to zero. By 2008, the keyhole had been determined to be less than 1\u00a0km wide. During the short time when it had been of greatest concern, Apophis set the record for highest rating ever on the Torino scale, reaching level\u00a04 on December 27, 2004.\n\nParagraph 7: Stanisic, born in Belgrade, Serbia, Yugoslavia, began playing soccer with Partizan. Although he made no appearance in the Yugoslav First League, he played a total of 56 games for Partizan, two of which were in the Yugoslav Cup.  In 1984, Stanisic moved to the United States where he signed with the New York Cosmos. While the Cosmos had gained its reputation as a top outdoor team in the North American Soccer League, that league had folded and the Cosmos had moved to the Major Indoor Soccer League (MISL). Stanisic and the Cosmos began the 1984-1985 MISL season, but the team\u2019s finances led to its leaving the league before the end of the season and folding a few weeks later. Stanisic then moved to the Chicago Sting, another ex-NASL team now playing in MISL. He spent two seasons in Chicago before moving to the Baltimore Blast in 1988. In 1988, Stanisic moved to the Hershey Impact of the American Indoor Soccer Association (AISA).  On November 8, 1990, the Blast released Stanisic.  The San Diego Sockers expressed an interest in signing Stanisic, but he chose to return to the Hershey Impact.  He then moved to the Illinois Thunder of the National Professional Soccer League (NPSL) for the 1991-1992 season.  He then moved to the Kansas City Attack (NPSL) for two seasons. However, Stanisic was plagued by injuries during the 1993-1994 season and was traded to the Harrisburg Heat during the 1994 off-season. In April 1995, he joined the Albany Alleycats for the summer outdoor season.  Stanisic experienced a rejuvenation with the Heat and was named a second team All Star for the 1995-1996 season.   Stanisic only played four games for the Heat during the 1997-1998 season when the Attack purchased his contract on December 1, 1997 with cash and a pick in the upcoming Amateur Draft.   He played out the rest of the 1997-1998 season in Kansas City, seeing time in twenty-eight games. In the 1998-1999 season, he played in only ten games and is not listed on any team\u2019s roster for the 1999-2000 season.   In 2000, Stanisic joined the Detroit Rockers where he played only eight games before retiring at the end of the 2000-2001 season.  On March 31, 2005, the Chicago Storm of the Major Indoor Soccer League signed Stanisic to a fifteen-day contract after injuries had decimated the Storm\u2019s goalkeeper corps.  However, he played no games during those fifteen days before retiring permanently.  Stanisic finished his NPSL career sixth on the all time goalkeeper wins list with 127.  While Stanisic made his reputation in indoor soccer, he also played several seasons of outdoor soccer in the U.S.  In 1989, he signed with the Albany Capitals of the American Soccer League (ASL).  In 1990, he was with the Washington Diplomats of the American Professional Soccer League (APSL).  The APSL was formed by the merger of the ASL and the Western Soccer League in 1989.  He was back with the Capitals in 1991, then spent the 1992 APSL season with the Miami Freedom.  In 1994, Stanisic returned to outdoor soccer with the Baltimore Bays of the USISL.\n\nParagraph 8: In 2004, a new controversy erupted at the end of the season when Auburn and Utah, who both finished the regular season , were left out of the BCS title game in favor of Oklahoma who also was  and had won decisively over Colorado in the Big 12 Championship game. USC went on to a win easily over Oklahoma in the Orange Bowl while Auburn and Utah both won their bowl games, leaving three undefeated teams at the end of the season.  Also, in that same year, Texas made up late ground on California (Cal) in the BCS standings and as a result grabbed a high-payout, at-large spot in the Rose Bowl.  Previous to that poll, Cal had been ranked ahead of Texas in both human polls and the BCS poll. Going into their final game, the Golden Bears were made aware that while margin of victory did not affect computer rankings, it did affect human polls and just eight voters changing their vote could affect the final standings.  Both teams won their game that week, but the Texas coach, Mack Brown, had made a public effort to lobby for his team to be moved higher in the ranking.  When the human polls were released, Texas remained behind Cal, but it had closed the gap enough so that the BCS poll (which determines placement) placed Texas above Cal, angering both Cal and its conference, the Pac-10. The final poll positions had been unchanged with Cal at No. 4 AP, No. 4 coaches, and No. 6 computers polls and Texas at No. 6 AP, No. 5 coaches, and No. 4 computer polls.  The AP Poll voters were caught in the middle because their vote changes were automatically publicized, while the votes of the Coaches poll were kept confidential.  Although there had been a more substantial shift in the votes of the Coaches Poll, the only clear targets for the ire of fanatical fans were the voters in the AP Poll.  While officials from both Cal and the Pac-10 called for the coaches' votes to be publicized, the overtures were turned down and did little to solve the problem of AP voters. Cal went on to lose to Texas Tech in the Holiday Bowl.  Texas defeated Michigan in the Rose Bowl.\n\nParagraph 9: In 1940, the Garrison had 4 officers and 101 Other Ranks. The detachments of 21 men each were on duty for 24 hours from 1300 hours on one day to 1300 hours the next. The troops were billeted at Prideaux Place, Padstow which had sleeping accommodation for 120 men & 4 officers, a cookhouse & dining hall and an officer's mess & kitchen. Prideaux Place served as the Battery Headquarters. Water at the site was a problem and to begin with, the battery had to transport water for drinking and washing from Prideaux Place in dustbins. Later, the old Victorian water tank was cleaned and that was then used. In August 1940, an ADS Advance Dressing Station was set up at Tregirls Farm. Sick Parade was held daily at 1000 hours at the Fisherman's Institute in the town. On the night of 7 September 1940, the battery was at the utmost readiness following the issue of Codeword Cromwell, meaning invasion imminent. The Resident Naval Officer in overall charge of the defence of Padstow, Rear Admiral Gordon Campbell, V.C., and the officer in charge of the land forces, Lt Dare Wilson of the 8th Battalion Royal Northumberland Fusiliers, kept watch from the control bunker of the underwater minefield laid across the estuary. No invasion arrived. On Saturday 5 October 1940, Padstow was bombed at 8pm but the battery was not hit. Three people \u2013 three generations from one family - were killed in New Street, Padstow. Six houses were extensively damaged and 61 other buildings suffered minor damage. The fin of one of the bombs is on display at Padstow Museum. On 8 October 1940, Major Kirby, I.G., from Plymouth, arrived with a towing launch. Two rafts 20 yards apart were attached to the launch. The targets were engaged as they came into view from Pentire Head to Newland Rock. The average range was 4400 yards and five hits were registered out of 13 shots. On 15 February 1941, both guns fired 10 rounds practice shells together in 3 series at a single Hans Kay target pulled behind a launch travelling at a speed of about 10 knots. Six hits were registered. By May 1941, two War Shelters had been built to accommodate the Watch on Duty whilst the Reserve Watch slept in two huts erected at the bottom of the field by St George's Cove. In May 1942, the two naval guns were returned to sea to help in the Battle of the Atlantic. They left Padstow from the town railway station. They were replaced by two French 138mm naval guns. These required new gun houses. No 1 was built south of the old barbette and magazine. Its platform can easily be found today with mounting bolts still in place. No 2 was built just north of the old northern gun house and its location can easily be found by the ready use lockers that are still extant. The Battery Observation Post was also extended at this time. On 11 May 1942, both 138mm guns had been proofed and were ready for action. On 17 March 1943, the examination service was discontinued as such and the majority of Officers, NCO's and men were released for service overseas and the guns put into care and preservation. In November 1943, the strength was reduced to one NCO and two men and the ammunition removed to Fort Picklecombe for storage. The guns were removed in July 1945.\n\nParagraph 10: Kanaan began to compete in the PPG/Firestone Indy Lights Championship Powered By Buick (now Indy Lights presented by Cooper Tires) in 1996 for Tasman Motorsports in the No. 37 Marlboro Lola T96/20-Buick V6. At the season-opening race at Homestead Motorsports Complex Kanaan started 9th and finished 10th. At the second race of the season on the Streets of Long Beach, Kanaan would start 3rd and finish 2nd. Kanaan moved from 10th to 3rd in points following the race. Kanaan's results in the next three races were 12th, 17th, and 7th at Nazareth Speedway, Michigan International Speedway and the Milwaukee Mile. In those races, Kanaan started 14th, 4th, and 11th. At Michigan Kanaan led for 8 laps before retiring due to a mechanical problem. At the race at Belle Isle State Park Kanaan started 5th and won his first race after leading for a race-high 29 of 36 laps. At the next race at Portland International Raceway Kanaan qualified on the pole position and finished 5th after leading for 3 laps. Kanaan would get a pair of 2nd-place finishes at the races at Circuit Trois-Rivi\u00e8res and Concord Pacific Place. In the latter, Kanaan led for a race-high 22 of 44 laps. At the next and season-ending race at Laguna Seca Raceway Kanaan qualified on the pole position and led for all 34 laps to get his second victory of the season. Kanaan would finish 2nd in points with 113 points.\n\nParagraph 11: Tenace became a coach after retiring as a player. He was touted as a possible managerial candidate during his later years. The Pittsburgh Pirates became strongly interested in the possibility of hiring Tenace as their manager to replace Chuck Tanner. When the year ended, however, Tanner was still the manager, so Tenace became a coach at the Major League level with the Houston Astros in 1986 and 1987, and later coached with the Toronto Blue Jays from 1990 to 1997. When manager Cito Gaston was sidelined with a herniated disc in 1991, Tenace served as the team's interim manager, going 19\u201314 and keeping Toronto competitive en route to an eventual American League Eastern Division title. He was part of Toronto's World Series-winning teams in 1992 and 1993, giving him six rings in six World Series appearances as a player and a coach. After he left the Jays, he joined the Boston Red Sox organization, serving as hitting coach for their Triple-A affiliate Pawtucket Red Sox in 1999, and Double-A affiliate Trenton Thunder in 2001. He then served as a hitting instructor for the St. Louis Cardinals organization. He was re-hired as the Blue Jays' hitting coach on June 20, 2008, when Cito Gaston replaced John Gibbons as the team's manager. Tenace replaced hitting coach Gary Denbo. He was one of two members of Gaston's old coaching staff from his last World Series championship team who were brought back to the team (third base coach Nick Leyva being the other). He announced his retirement following the 2009 season.\n\nParagraph 12: The Efflux chamber of the engine was made of nickel tubes brazed together through which flowed kerosene down one tube and back up the adjacent tube via a manifold at the mouth of the chamber. After static firings, these chambers were checked by climbing inside the engine from beneath. The mouth was  in diameter but that of the throat was smaller, which restricted access to the inspector. In addition, during firing, the inside of the chamber became coated with fine carbon, making inspection a filthy procedure. However, the chamber required careful inspection because firing would occasionally create small holes in the walls.\n\nParagraph 13: Rosenberg maintains that the efforts made by women's rights, pro-choice, and civil rights activists to use the courts to produce social change have not been very effective. To prove and support this claim, he examines a great deal of statistical information. In looking at the effects that Brown v. Board had on desegregation, for example, Rosenberg looks at the percentage of black schoolchildren attending mixed schools in the South in the years preceding this landmark decision, and the years following it. He finds that almost no measurable change had occurred in the ten years following this decision. Indeed, it is not until the Civil Rights Act of 1964 that the percentage begins to increase annually. Similarly, in looking at Roe v. Wade, he finds that the annual number of legal abortions did not seem to be greatly affected by the Court's decision.\n\nParagraph 14: Home computer games became popular following the video game crash of 1983, leading to the era of the \"bedroom coder\". In the 1990s, PC games lost mass market traction to console games on the fifth generation such as the Sega Saturn, Nintendo 64 and PlayStation, before enjoying a resurgence in the mid-2000s through digital distribution on online service providers such as Steam and GOG.com. PC gaming is considered synonymous with IBM PC compatible systems; while mobile devices\u00a0\u2013 smartphones and tablets, such as those running on Android or iOS platforms\u00a0\u2013  are also PCs in the general sense as opposed to console or arcade machine. Microsoft Windows has become the dominant operating system for PC games.\n\nThe following is an abstract.\n\nStanisic, originally from Yugoslavia, began his soccer career playing for Partizan. He then moved to the United States and signed with the New York Cosmos in the Major Indoor Soccer League (MISL). However, due to financial issues, the team left the league and folded. Stanisic then played for the Chicago Sting, Baltimore Blast, Hershey Impact, Illinois Thunder, Kansas City Attack, Harrisburg Heat, and Albany Alleycats. He experienced a career rejuvenation with the Heat and was named a second team All Star. He briefly played for the Detroit Rockers before retiring. Later, he signed a short-term contract with the Chicago Storm. Stanisic also played outdoor soccer with the Albany Capitals, Washington Diplomats, Miami Freedom, and Baltimore Bays.\n\nPlease enter the number of the paragraph that the abstract is from.

This application of mass selection improves the mean performance of the forest. Offspring is obtained from selected trees and grown in test plantations that act as genetic trials. Based on such tests the best genotypes among the parents can be selected. Selected trees are typically multiplied by either seeds or grafting and seed orchards are established when the preferred output is improved seed. Alternatively, the best genotypes can be directly propagated by cuttings or in-vitro methods and used directly in clonal plantations. The first system is frequently used in pines and other conifers, while the second is typical in some broadleaves (poplars, eucalypts and others). The objectives of a tree breeding program range from yield improvement and adaptation to particular conditions, to pest- and disease-resistance, wood properties, etc. Currently, tree breeding is starting to take advantage of the fast development in plant genetics and genomics.\n\nParagraph 2: James Berardinelli of ReelViews gave the film one out of four stars and wrote: \"This is a dreadful motion picture - a lowbrow example of period piece comedy with terrible production values and an exceptionally poor laughs-to-jokes ratio. There's a kind of desperation in the movie's approach to humor that reveals the film makers' uncertainty about how entertaining the material is; the manic style betrays itself as a last-ditch attempt to hide the flaws of a failed script.\"  Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly wrote: \"Almost Heroes [...] gives off the discomforting reek of desperation. ... How could director Christopher Guest [...] have reduced himself to staging gags such as Farley's slap-fest with hostile Injuns, Eugene Levy (as a nasty pirate) speaking in a zany French accent, or Farley stealing an egg from an eagle's nest, punching out the bird, and then falling to the ground with an epic thud? Almost Heroes goes thud too. Despite his compulsion to trash everything in his midst, including himself, Chris Farley deserved better.\"  John R. McEwen of Film Quips Online wrote: \"It's clear, his death notwithstanding, that Farley is the funniest thing about this... As expected, there is little here but sight gags and low humor, but if you're in the mood (and I must have been), it has its laugh-out-loud moments. ... Perry also has a few good bits, but he is obviously a distant second banana. Additional appearances by people like Eugene Levy and Kevin Dunn, and others, add to the hilarity, although many of the jokes fall flat...I doubt if anyone ever expected Chris Farley to win an Academy Award. But it is a fitting tribute to him that his last outing, while not a great work of American cinema, can provide a good dose of chuckles, and more than a few belly laughs.\"\n\nParagraph 3: Centers was born in Tyler, Texas and grew up in  Longview. He began playing little league football for the Bramlette Bears as a running back and quarterback during his elementary school years and went on to play in middle school for the Forest Park Eagles and high school for the Longview Lobos until his junior year. He played on both sides of the ball as a defensive back and runnningback and wide receiver. Centers did not play football at all his junior year of high school. After his family moved to nearby Tatum, where his mother was an administrator in education, Centers decided to play football again after being urged to do so by his elder brother. After a solid season in Tatum, he earned a scholarship to nearby Stephen F. Austin State University. He was also recruited by Baylor, Texas Tech, and several junior colleges. His brother, Donnie, played for the University of Arkansas and coach Lou Holtz as a wide receiver.\n\nParagraph 4: The new stadium took its name from the street which encloses the ground on three sides, the fourth boundary being the River Wensum. The name \"Carrow\" originally refers to the former Carrow Abbey that once stood on the riverside, its name in turn having possible Norse origins. In 1800, John Ridges, owner of the Carrow Abbey Estate and the land opposite on the banks of the Wensum in Thorpe Hamlet, \"granted permission for a proposed road access across his grounds to Carrow\". By 1811, Philip M. Martineau, a surgeon, owned the building, lands and manor of Carrow, including the adjacent Thorpe land. Carrow Hill Road was created on his Carrow Abbey Estate, to provide work for the poor in the community. The road linked Martineau's Bracondale Estate to Carrow Toll Bridge, installed in 1810. Norwich Railway Co. had acquired the land in Thorpe around Carrow Road by the 1840s, and by 1860 the Thorpe site of the future stadium belonged to the firm of J. & J. Colman. The stadium's Thorpe Corner acknowledges this historical link. In 1935, Colman's offered the 20-year leasehold to Norwich City and construction of the new stadium began swiftly on the site: tenders were issued on the day the site was purchased and ten days later, on 11 June, work began.\n\nParagraph 5: In 1972, Al-Farouk Sports Club held a ceremony in honor of Prince Khalid bin Faisal Al Saud on the occasion of his appointment as the governor of Asir. The ceremony was held at the club's headquarters and a number of matters which concern the club were discussed. One of the matters that were discussed was a name change proposed by the Prince to members of the club's board. It was unanimously agreed by members of the board and fans of the club to change the club's name to Al-Wadiea Sports Club. Al-Wadiea achieved promotion to the Saudi First Division for the first time in 1977. They spent two seasons in the First Division before being relegated to the regional leagues. In 1983, the club once again achieved promotion to the First Division and spent two seasons before being relegated at the end of the 1984\u201385 season. Al-Wadiea were once again promoted in 1994 before being relegated after a season. In 1999, the club changed their name from Al-Wadiea Sports Club to Abha Sports Club. That same year, the club was promoted to the Second Division under the guidance of Saad Saleh Al-Bishri as manager. A year later the club achieved promotion once again but this time to the First Division with the Algerian, Elias Bou Zaid, as manager. In 2005, Abha were promoted to the Pro League, the top tier of Saudi football, for the first time after finishing second in the 2004\u201305 season. The club were relegated after just a season in the top tier. Abha once again reached the Pro League after finishing second in the 2007\u201308 season. They were relegated after a season following their loss to Al-Raed in the relegation play-offs. Abha then spent six consecutive seasons in the Saudi First Division before getting relegated to the Second Division for the first time since 2000. On 4 May 2018, Abha defeated Al-Watani 2\u20131 on aggregate in the promotion play-offs to earn promotion to the second tier. On 30 April 2019, Abha were promoted to the top flight for the third time after a 2\u20132 draw away to Al-Nojoom. This was their second promotion in two seasons, becoming the sixth Saudi team to achieve this feat. On 11 May 2019, Abha won their first MS League title despite losing to Al-Qaisumah. The 2019\u201320 season was Abha's most successful season in the Pro League. They achieved their highest finish in the top flight after finishing ninth. The club also reached the semi-finals of the King Cup for the first time.\n\nParagraph 6: 99942 Apophis is a near-Earth asteroid and potentially hazardous asteroid with a diameter of  that caused a brief period of concern in December 2004 when initial observations indicated a probability up to 2.7% that it would hit Earth on April\u00a013, 2029. Additional observations provided improved predictions that eliminated the possibility of an impact on Earth in 2029. Until 2006 a small probability nevertheless remained that, during its 2029 close encounter with Earth, Apophis would pass through a gravitational keyhole of no more than about  in diameter, which would have set up a future impact exactly seven years later on April\u00a013, 2036. This possibility kept it at Level\u00a01 on the Torino impact hazard scale until August 2006, when the probability that Apophis would pass through the keyhole was determined to be very small and Apophis' rating on the Torino scale was lowered to zero. By 2008, the keyhole had been determined to be less than 1\u00a0km wide. During the short time when it had been of greatest concern, Apophis set the record for highest rating ever on the Torino scale, reaching level\u00a04 on December 27, 2004.\n\nParagraph 7: Stanisic, born in Belgrade, Serbia, Yugoslavia, began playing soccer with Partizan. Although he made no appearance in the Yugoslav First League, he played a total of 56 games for Partizan, two of which were in the Yugoslav Cup.  In 1984, Stanisic moved to the United States where he signed with the New York Cosmos. While the Cosmos had gained its reputation as a top outdoor team in the North American Soccer League, that league had folded and the Cosmos had moved to the Major Indoor Soccer League (MISL). Stanisic and the Cosmos began the 1984-1985 MISL season, but the team\u2019s finances led to its leaving the league before the end of the season and folding a few weeks later. Stanisic then moved to the Chicago Sting, another ex-NASL team now playing in MISL. He spent two seasons in Chicago before moving to the Baltimore Blast in 1988. In 1988, Stanisic moved to the Hershey Impact of the American Indoor Soccer Association (AISA).  On November 8, 1990, the Blast released Stanisic.  The San Diego Sockers expressed an interest in signing Stanisic, but he chose to return to the Hershey Impact.  He then moved to the Illinois Thunder of the National Professional Soccer League (NPSL) for the 1991-1992 season.  He then moved to the Kansas City Attack (NPSL) for two seasons. However, Stanisic was plagued by injuries during the 1993-1994 season and was traded to the Harrisburg Heat during the 1994 off-season. In April 1995, he joined the Albany Alleycats for the summer outdoor season.  Stanisic experienced a rejuvenation with the Heat and was named a second team All Star for the 1995-1996 season.   Stanisic only played four games for the Heat during the 1997-1998 season when the Attack purchased his contract on December 1, 1997 with cash and a pick in the upcoming Amateur Draft.   He played out the rest of the 1997-1998 season in Kansas City, seeing time in twenty-eight games. In the 1998-1999 season, he played in only ten games and is not listed on any team\u2019s roster for the 1999-2000 season.   In 2000, Stanisic joined the Detroit Rockers where he played only eight games before retiring at the end of the 2000-2001 season.  On March 31, 2005, the Chicago Storm of the Major Indoor Soccer League signed Stanisic to a fifteen-day contract after injuries had decimated the Storm\u2019s goalkeeper corps.  However, he played no games during those fifteen days before retiring permanently.  Stanisic finished his NPSL career sixth on the all time goalkeeper wins list with 127.  While Stanisic made his reputation in indoor soccer, he also played several seasons of outdoor soccer in the U.S.  In 1989, he signed with the Albany Capitals of the American Soccer League (ASL).  In 1990, he was with the Washington Diplomats of the American Professional Soccer League (APSL).  The APSL was formed by the merger of the ASL and the Western Soccer League in 1989.  He was back with the Capitals in 1991, then spent the 1992 APSL season with the Miami Freedom.  In 1994, Stanisic returned to outdoor soccer with the Baltimore Bays of the USISL.\n\nParagraph 8: In 2004, a new controversy erupted at the end of the season when Auburn and Utah, who both finished the regular season , were left out of the BCS title game in favor of Oklahoma who also was  and had won decisively over Colorado in the Big 12 Championship game. USC went on to a win easily over Oklahoma in the Orange Bowl while Auburn and Utah both won their bowl games, leaving three undefeated teams at the end of the season.  Also, in that same year, Texas made up late ground on California (Cal) in the BCS standings and as a result grabbed a high-payout, at-large spot in the Rose Bowl.  Previous to that poll, Cal had been ranked ahead of Texas in both human polls and the BCS poll. Going into their final game, the Golden Bears were made aware that while margin of victory did not affect computer rankings, it did affect human polls and just eight voters changing their vote could affect the final standings.  Both teams won their game that week, but the Texas coach, Mack Brown, had made a public effort to lobby for his team to be moved higher in the ranking.  When the human polls were released, Texas remained behind Cal, but it had closed the gap enough so that the BCS poll (which determines placement) placed Texas above Cal, angering both Cal and its conference, the Pac-10. The final poll positions had been unchanged with Cal at No. 4 AP, No. 4 coaches, and No. 6 computers polls and Texas at No. 6 AP, No. 5 coaches, and No. 4 computer polls.  The AP Poll voters were caught in the middle because their vote changes were automatically publicized, while the votes of the Coaches poll were kept confidential.  Although there had been a more substantial shift in the votes of the Coaches Poll, the only clear targets for the ire of fanatical fans were the voters in the AP Poll.  While officials from both Cal and the Pac-10 called for the coaches' votes to be publicized, the overtures were turned down and did little to solve the problem of AP voters. Cal went on to lose to Texas Tech in the Holiday Bowl.  Texas defeated Michigan in the Rose Bowl.\n\nParagraph 9: In 1940, the Garrison had 4 officers and 101 Other Ranks. The detachments of 21 men each were on duty for 24 hours from 1300 hours on one day to 1300 hours the next. The troops were billeted at Prideaux Place, Padstow which had sleeping accommodation for 120 men & 4 officers, a cookhouse & dining hall and an officer's mess & kitchen.

{"prompt": "Here are 30 paragraphs from Wikipedia, along with an abstract. Please determine which paragraph the abstract is from.\n\nParagraph 1: The ruler of Hell is revealed not to be Happy, but a shapeshifting demon named Bill assuming her form. After failing to torment Gertrude with a twisted version of her home, he condemns her to an eternity of repeating her quest. Meanwhile, Horribella calls Bill and demands Queen Cloudia's bones, her payment for engineering Gertrude's death. Bill has the bones delivered to her by Duncan, who has become a postal courier. Horribella, planning to bring about the end of Fairyland, resurrects Cloudia as a powerful undead being who kills her and goes on a destructive rampage. Realising that Gertrude is the only one who can defeat \"Dark Cloudia\", Duncan and Larry confront the Fairyland Council and tell them that they must resurrect Gertrude to save Fairyland. The Council initially refuse, citing the rules of Fairyland, but Duncan retorts that the rules, and the council, are directly responsible for the crisis, and that by kidnapping children like him and Gertrude, they have abdicated any moral authority. One of the Council member concedes that Duncan is correct, and orders Bill to deliver the pocket dimension containing Gertrude's Hell to the council chamber. Duncan and Larry enter Hell and inform Gertrude about Dark Cloudia; subsequently, Gertrude agrees to kill Cloudia again. When returned to Fairyland she attempts to renege on the deal and demands to return to Hell when she realizes that her actions would serve the council's purpose. The Council nevertheless promises to return Gertrude home if she succeeds, and forcibly empowers her with their combined magic. Meanwhile, Dark Cloudia destroys the army of King Cone, the new Fairyland king, who tried to stop her wave of destruction in vain. Before the villain could slay the king, however, Gertrude appears and attacks her with her new magical powers, depowering Dark Cloudia and beating her up. Although Gertrude almost kills Cloudia again, Larry reminds her that the Council never specified that Cloudia has to die in their request, and Gertrude decides to follow his advice for once and gives the defeated villain to King Cone in order to be imprisoned for her crimes. The Council then appears, angry because Gertrude didn't kill Cloudia (despite the fact that she technically fulfilled their request) and threatening to exile her to a remote place in Fairyland, until Gertrude reminds them that she still has their combined magic inside her and would use it to kill them unless they honour their part of the deal, and the fearful Council quickly sends her back home, much to Larry's sorrow. Back on Earth, Gertrude, now an adult woman in her thirties, finds herself employed as a clerk in a television station, ironically frustrated by her mundane job and looking for a way to return. However, she abandons her search and ruefully curses Fairyland one last time before getting back to work, determined to face her lot in life.\n\nParagraph 2: For distinguished and conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty, while pilot of an airplane of Bombing Squadron 5, Lt. Powers participated, with his squadron, in 5 engagements with Japanese forces in the Coral Sea area and adjacent waters during the period 4 to 8 May 1942. Three attacks were made on enemy objectives at or near Tulagi on 4 May. In these attacks he scored a direct hit which instantly demolished a large enemy gunboat or destroyer and is credited with 2 close misses, 1 of which severely damaged a large aircraft tender, the other damaging a 20,000-ton transport. He fearlessly strafed a gunboat, firing all his ammunition into it amid intense antiaircraft fire. This gunboat was then observed to be leaving a heavy oil slick in its wake and later was seen beached on a nearby island. On 7 May, an attack was launched against an enemy airplane carrier and other units of the enemy's invasion force. He fearlessly led his attack section of 3 Douglas Dauntless dive bombers, to attack the carrier. On this occasion he dived in the face of heavy antiaircraft fire, to an altitude well below the safety altitude, at the risk of his life and almost certain damage to his own plane, in order that he might positively obtain a hit in a vital part of the ship, which would insure her complete destruction. This bomb hit was noted by many pilots and observers to cause a tremendous explosion engulfing the ship in a mass of flame, smoke, and debris. The ship sank soon after. That evening, in his capacity as Squadron Gunnery Officer, Lt. Powers gave a lecture to the squadron on point-of-aim and diving technique. During this discourse he advocated low release point in order to insure greater accuracy; yet he stressed the danger not only from enemy fire and the resultant low pull-out, but from own bomb blast and bomb fragments. Thus his low-dive bombing attacks were deliberate and premeditated, since he well knew and realized the dangers of such tactics, but went far beyond the call of duty in order to further the cause which he knew to be right. The next morning, 8 May, as the pilots of the attack group left the ready room to man planes, his indomitable spirit and leadership were well expressed in his own words, \"Remember the folks back home are counting on us. I am going to get a hit if I have to lay it on their flight deck.\" He led his section of dive bombers down to the target from an altitude of 18,000 feet, through a wall of bursting antiaircraft shells and into the face of enemy fighter planes. Again, completely disregarding the safety altitude and without fear or concern for his safety, Lt. Powers courageously pressed home his attack, almost to the very deck of an enemy carrier and did not release his bomb until he was sure of a direct hit. He was last seen attempting recovery from his dive at the extremely low altitude of 200 feet, and amid a terrific barrage of shell and bomb fragments, smoke, flame and debris from the stricken vessel.\n\nParagraph 3: The train left Washington, on April 21 at 12:30pm. It bore Lincoln's eldest son Robert Todd and the remains of Lincoln's younger son, William Wallace Lincoln (1850\u20131862), but not Lincoln's wife Mary Todd Lincoln, who was too distraught to make the trip. The train largely retraced the route Lincoln had traveled to Washington as the president-elect on his way to his first inauguration, more than four years earlier. The train arrived at Springfield on May 3. Lincoln was interred on May 4, at Oak Ridge Cemetery in Springfield. Every town the train passed or stopped in there was always a crowd to pay their respects to one of the greatest men in history.\n\nParagraph 4: Pooja Sahani, Raj Khanna and Tina Kapoor are childhood friends. While Raj has always been attracted to Tina, he is unaware that Pooja is secretly in love with him. Raj's father decides to move to London with his family because of his work. Before leaving, Raj makes Tina promise to keep in touch with him via e-mail. Tina, who is fun-loving and distracted, does not want the responsibility, so instead of her Pooja writes to Raj, signing the emails as \"Tina\" instead of her own name so that Tina can keep her promise to Raj. Over the years, they become close while exchanging e-mails to each other. \n\nParagraph 5: The supply chains that were disrupted during the COVID-19 pandemic faced huge challenges and struggled to recover. Industries around the world shutdown due to the rapid spread of the virus in 2020. There was reduced industrial activity and lower consumer demand. While consumer demand increased quickly when lockdowns were lifted, manufacturers and distributors of goods were stymied by worker shortages and a lack of key components and raw materials. Additional bottlenecks included containers, shipping, trucks, railroads and warehouses. Ports around the world were impacted with ports in the United States in particular experiencing blockages as they were overwhelmed with container ships and their cargo. The ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles together account for approximately 40% of the shipping containers entering the United States. More than three-quarters of the containers leaving Los Angeles were empty in July 2021 whereas about two-thirds of the containers leaving U.S. ports are typically filled with exports. Many of containers were going back empty due to the rush by shippers to bring in imports of back-to-school supplies and fall fashions from Asia. This impacted Midwestern farmers and California almond growers who ship to customers overseas. Shipping companies placed a lower priority on products that paid lower shipping rates resulting in various exports being delayed. In October, there were a record number of ships at the docks of these two Los Angeles area ports as well a record number of ships waiting for a slip. In early November, more than 100 ships were anchored in San Pedro Bay. It was unusual for even one vessel to be waiting offshore before the coronavirus pandemic. In late 2021 and the first month of 2022, container ships have remained at American ports unloading goods for seven days on average, 21 percent higher than at the start of the pandemic. The mayhem at ports and shipping yards was a key driver for rising prices together with the market dominance of major companies. In early 2022, politicians and central bankers worked to tame inflation as businesses continued to struggle to manufacture and distribute their products. By July the total value of trade stuck on the water off the east and west coast ports was estimated at roughly $30 billion. Another $1.5 billion in trade was waiting for rail service at the Ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles which was 60% of all containers waiting at these ports. By September 2022, the backlog at U.S. ports decreased partially due to slowing U.S. import volumes amid high inflation and rising interest rates.\n\nParagraph 6: Each summer, recently published alumni return to the conference with their recently published books. Alumni who have been part of this reading series include Anita Amirrezvani, Eddy Ancinas, Ramona Ausubel, David Bajo, Charmaine Craig, Eileen Cronin, Heather Donahue, Cai Emmons, Amy Franklin-Willis, Joshua Ferris, Jamie Ford, Vicki Forman, Alison Singh Gee, Tanya Egan Gibson, Alan Grostephan, Judith Hendricks, Susan Henderson, Sara J.

It also had trade routes between Kinsale and Tenby, which made the port stronger. In 1208 it was listed as having provided King John with ships and men to invade Ireland; in 1247 it supplied a ship to the fleet that was sent to conquer the Western Isles of Scotland; 6 ships, with 79 men were sent to support the siege of Calais. Ilfracombe was the last disembarkation point for two large forces sent to subdue the Irish. The building which sits on Lantern Hill by the harbour, known as St Nicholas's Chapel (built 1361) is reputed to be the oldest working lighthouse in the UK; a light/beacon has been there for over 650 years. The town was also home to the Bowen family. James Bowen was master of HMS Queen Charlotte, the flagship of Richard, Earl Howe at the 1794 \"Glorious First of June\" battle. James Bowen was commissioned by Howe for his leadership in the battle, he rose through the levels - commander of the Argot, the Dreadnought, and in Georgian England titled \"defender of Madeira\", led the fleet which rescued the British army at Corunna in the Peninsula war, and retired as a Rear Admiral, Commissioner of the Royal Navy. Captain Richard Bowen (1761\u20131797) James Bowen's younger brother, a British naval commander on the ship HMS Terpsichore, served under Lord Nelson, and was killed at the battle of Santa Cruz de Tenerife. John Bowen (1780\u20131827), son of James Bowen, a naval officer and colonial administrator founded the first settlement of Tasmania at Risdon Cove in 1803 - the settlement which later became known as Hobart. Lieutenant A E Down, was initially posted to Ilfracombe to lead a protection ship for the customs and excise, he married a local girl, rose through the levels to retire as vice Admiral, his son joined the navy aged 14 (his first navy kit is on display at National Maritime Museum Greenwich). In 1802 James Meek married Down's daughter and settled in the town, James Meek was appointed the Comptroller of Victuals to the Royal Navy in 1832, he was knighted, and died in Ilfracombe 1852. (gentlemen's gazette)\n\nParagraph 8: Upon their return to Tortall, Alanna is met by her old friend Raoul of Goldenlake, who informs her of three key events that have occurred in her absence: the Tortallan monarchs have died; Prince Jonathan has been named King but not yet been crowned; and Alanna's twin brother Thom, to prove himself the most powerful sorcerer in the realm, has resurrected Duke Roger (killed by Alanna in an earlier book). Alanna hurries to take Jonathan's side and give him the Dominion Jewel, and Jonathan names her as his King's Champion. Elsewhere in Corus, Thom is being rapidly poisoned by his own magic, by its interaction with that of Roger. On the eve of the Coronation, Tortall's Great Mother Goddess warns Alanna that the ceremony will be a \"crossroad in time\", decisive of the realm's future. During the coronation, Roger\u2019s plan comes to fruition: he causes a series of magical earthquakes using his and Thom\u2019s joined power to bring down the palace, while insurgents loyal to Roger and his allies Lady Delia of Eldorne, Alex of Tirragen (Alanna\u2019s childhood friend), and Claw, aka Ralon of Malven (Alanna\u2019s former bully) storm the palace. Jonathan uses his Gift and unleashes the Dominion Jewel\u2019s power to keep the earthquakes at bay, while Alanna\u2018s friends battle to protect Jonathan from assassination and Alanna goes in search of Roger. In the prolonged battle, Thom dies, drained of his life by Roger's magic. Alanna duels Alex and defeats him. She then kills Josianne, after the princess has killed Si Cham and Faithful. Roger awaits her in the catacombs, presiding over a Gate of Idramm. He reveals how he survived his death due to Sorcerer's Sleep, as well as his hand in Lightning's origins. Weary and temporarily Giftless, Alanna remains ready for battle. Roger summons Lightning toward him, and after resisting, she realizes the benefit of having the sword fly toward him. In less than the blink of an eye, Roger is impaled by the force of the sword's movement. Alanna emerges from the battle to find in the aftermath that Jonathan and her friends survived, the insurgents are defeated and captured, but Liam Ironarm was killed defending Jonathan.\n\nParagraph 9: In the second season, Arthur's relationships with Merlin and Morgana's maidservant, Guinevere, deepen. In \"The Once and Future Queen\", Arthur spent a few days living with Gwen while he entered a jousting tournament under an assumed name. Called out on his rude and inconsiderate behaviour by Gwen, Arthur slowly began to develop feelings for her, and they even shared their first kiss on the last day of the tournament. Shortly thereafter in the episode, \"Lancelot and Guinevere\", Arthur and Merlin raced to rescue Gwen after she was kidnapped by a warlord, Hengist. He was devastated to see then that Gwen had discovered that she had feelings for Lancelot, who had also tried to rescue her at this time. Arthur's stance on the subject of magic was also explored in the second season. In the episode, \"The Sins of the Father\", Arthur voiced the thought that it was possible that not all magic users were evil when Merlin cautioned him not to trust the sorceress, Morgause, too quickly. When Morgause subsequently engineered the revelation of the truth of Arthur's magic-induced birth, which resulted in the death of Arthur's mother, Arthur returned to Camelot and nearly killed Uther in a blind rage. He was only stopped when Merlin intervened, who tearfully claimed that Morgause had been lying and faked the story. Arthur later claimed to believe that all magic was evil, which visibly devastated Merlin. Arthur's relationship with Morgana was also developed in the second season. He was greatly concerned when she was thought to have been kidnapped by the Druids, and set off to rescue her in \"The Nightmare Begins\". In the penultimate episode, \"The Fires of Idirsholas\", Arthur was visibly devastated when Morgana was seemingly kidnapped by Morgause, blaming himself for having failed to protect her. In the finale episode, \"The Last Dragonlord\", Arthur was yet again called upon to defend Camelot against overwhelming odds. With the Great Dragon freed and repeatedly attacking Camelot, Arthur and Merlin set off in the faint hope that they could secure the aid of the last living Dragonlord, Balinor, who was also, unbeknownst to Arthur, Merlin's father. Though they eventually gained Balinor's willingness to help, mainly because Balinor was saved in the past by Gaius, the older man was killed on the journey back to Camelot. After returning to Camelot, Arthur gathered together a group of knights to make a final assault in the hope of defeating the dragon, even over Uther's protests. He led them and Merlin, who insisted on accompanying him, out into a field beyond Camelot to engage the dragon. Arthur stabbed the dragon with a lance, but was subsequently knocked out. When he came to, Merlin told him that he had dealt the dragon a mortal blow, when in reality Merlin used his new status as a Dragonlord to command it to cease its attack.\n\nParagraph 10: Male, female. Forewing length 5.2\u20135.5\u00a0mm. Head: frons shining ochreous-white with greenish and reddish reflections, vertex and neck tufts shining greyish brown with reddish reflection, medially and laterally lined white, collar greyish brown; labial palpus first segment very short, white, second segment fourth-fifths of the length of third, white with a greyish-brown line dorsally and laterally on outside, basal one-third white dorsally, third segment white, lined dark brown laterally; scape dark brown with a white anterior line, white ventrally; antenna shining dark greyish brown, a white line from base to beyond one-half, at two-thirds an indistinct whitish ring of one segment.

Using mahogany frames and the new marine plywood laminated with resorcinol glues, Rayner marked his return to the sea by building a 20-foot hard chine bilge keel gunter-rigged sloop \u2013 the Westcoaster \u2013 designed initially for a customer wishing to navigate the difficult waters and scarce harbours of the Bristol Channel, where Rayner had been torpedoed in 1944. Rayner gave the Westcoaster \"sitting head room for tall men\" \u2013 rare in yachts so small \u2013 while ingeniously camouflaging the reverse sheer needed for such generous accommodation by carrying the decks out to the sides of the boat as he had with Robinetta 20 years earlier. Similarly all the Westcoaster's running rigging came back to the cockpit making her easy to handle single-handed. He sailed and demonstrated the first of such yachts, painted a rich royal international blue \u2013 often called Oxford Blue \u2013 enthusing about its good looks, its affordability, its practicality for weekend \"pottering\" and fitness for deeper waters despite a draft of no more than 2'3\" (70\u00a0cm). This design ensemble was topped by Rayner's preference for the gunter rig, its short mast, compared to a Bermudian, making it easier to tow on a trailer, to lower and raise, for the bridges of inland waterways, as well as allowing a swift reef \u2013 by lowering the boom \u2013 in a squall. Rayner also wrote that he valued the greater 'lifting' quality of a gaff or gunter mainsail as compared to the Bermudian main, prior to the wider use, with that rig, of masthead Genoas \u2013 headsails of greater area than the mainsail \u2013 which in Rayner's view, in 1962, was 'the herald of rigs to come' with 'great aerodynamic efficiency and with enormous lift!', and returning, in effect, \"to the lateen-shaped loose-footed sails of the Mediterranean but with a taut forestay replacing the heavy lateen yard...\" A small number of Westcoasters were later modified by the addition of a small bowsprit, with the cutter rig giving an even greater sail area.\n\nThe following is an abstract.\n\nIn this text, it is revealed that the ruler of Hell is not Happy, but a demon named Bill who has been shapeshifting to look like her. Bill fails to torment Gertrude and condemns her to repeating her quest for eternity. Horribella requests Queen Cloudia's bones as payment for engineering Gertrude's death. Bill has the bones delivered to her and Horribella resurrects Cloudia as a powerful undead being. Duncan and Larry realize that Gertrude is the only one who can defeat Cloudia and convince the Fairyland Council to resurrect her.

In late 2021 and the first month of 2022, container ships have remained at American ports unloading goods for seven days on average, 21 percent higher than at the start of the pandemic. The mayhem at ports and shipping yards was a key driver for rising prices together with the market dominance of major companies. In early 2022, politicians and central bankers worked to tame inflation as businesses continued to struggle to manufacture and distribute their products. By July the total value of trade stuck on the water off the east and west coast ports was estimated at roughly $30 billion. Another $1.5 billion in trade was waiting for rail service at the Ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles which was 60% of all containers waiting at these ports. By September 2022, the backlog at U.S. ports decreased partially due to slowing U.S. import volumes amid high inflation and rising interest rates.\n\nParagraph 6: Each summer, recently published alumni return to the conference with their recently published books. Alumni who have been part of this reading series include Anita Amirrezvani, Eddy Ancinas, Ramona Ausubel, David Bajo, Charmaine Craig, Eileen Cronin, Heather Donahue, Cai Emmons, Amy Franklin-Willis, Joshua Ferris, Jamie Ford, Vicki Forman, Alison Singh Gee, Tanya Egan Gibson, Alan Grostephan, Judith Hendricks, Susan Henderson, Sara J.

It also had trade routes between Kinsale and Tenby, which made the port stronger. In 1208 it was listed as having provided King John with ships and men to invade Ireland; in 1247 it supplied a ship to the fleet that was sent to conquer the Western Isles of Scotland; 6 ships, with 79 men were sent to support the siege of Calais. Ilfracombe was the last disembarkation point for two large forces sent to subdue the Irish. The building which sits on Lantern Hill by the harbour, known as St Nicholas's Chapel (built 1361) is reputed to be the oldest working lighthouse in the UK; a light/beacon has been there for over 650 years. The town was also home to the Bowen family. James Bowen was master of HMS Queen Charlotte, the flagship of Richard, Earl Howe at the 1794 \"Glorious First of June\" battle. James Bowen was commissioned by Howe for his leadership in the battle, he rose through the levels - commander of the Argot, the Dreadnought, and in Georgian England titled \"defender of Madeira\", led the fleet which rescued the British army at Corunna in the Peninsula war, and retired as a Rear Admiral, Commissioner of the Royal Navy. Captain Richard Bowen (1761\u20131797) James Bowen's younger brother, a British naval commander on the ship HMS Terpsichore, served under Lord Nelson, and was killed at the battle of Santa Cruz de Tenerife. John Bowen (1780\u20131827), son of James Bowen, a naval officer and colonial administrator founded the first settlement of Tasmania at Risdon Cove in 1803 - the settlement which later became known as Hobart. Lieutenant A E Down, was initially posted to Ilfracombe to lead a protection ship for the customs and excise, he married a local girl, rose through the levels to retire as vice Admiral, his son joined the navy aged 14 (his first navy kit is on display at National Maritime Museum Greenwich). In 1802 James Meek married Down's daughter and settled in the town, James Meek was appointed the Comptroller of Victuals to the Royal Navy in 1832, he was knighted, and died in Ilfracombe 1852. (gentlemen's gazette)\n\nParagraph 8: Upon their return to Tortall, Alanna is met by her old friend Raoul of Goldenlake, who informs her of three key events that have occurred in her absence: the Tortallan monarchs have died; Prince Jonathan has been named King but not yet been crowned; and Alanna's twin brother Thom, to prove himself the most powerful sorcerer in the realm, has resurrected Duke Roger (killed by Alanna in an earlier book). Alanna hurries to take Jonathan's side and give him the Dominion Jewel, and Jonathan names her as his King's Champion. Elsewhere in Corus, Thom is being rapidly poisoned by his own magic, by its interaction with that of Roger. On the eve of the Coronation, Tortall's Great Mother Goddess warns Alanna that the ceremony will be a \"crossroad in time\", decisive of the realm's future. During the coronation, Roger\u2019s plan comes to fruition: he causes a series of magical earthquakes using his and Thom\u2019s joined power to bring down the palace, while insurgents loyal to Roger and his allies Lady Delia of Eldorne, Alex of Tirragen (Alanna\u2019s childhood friend), and Claw, aka Ralon of Malven (Alanna\u2019s former bully) storm the palace. Jonathan uses his Gift and unleashes the Dominion Jewel\u2019s power to keep the earthquakes at bay, while Alanna\u2018s friends battle to protect Jonathan from assassination and Alanna goes in search of Roger. In the prolonged battle, Thom dies, drained of his life by Roger's magic. Alanna duels Alex and defeats him. She then kills Josianne, after the princess has killed Si Cham and Faithful. Roger awaits her in the catacombs, presiding over a Gate of Idramm. He reveals how he survived his death due to Sorcerer's Sleep, as well as his hand in Lightning's origins. Weary and temporarily Giftless, Alanna remains ready for battle. Roger summons Lightning toward him, and after resisting, she realizes the benefit of having the sword fly toward him. In less than the blink of an eye, Roger is impaled by the force of the sword's movement. Alanna emerges from the battle to find in the aftermath that Jonathan and her friends survived, the insurgents are defeated and captured, but Liam Ironarm was killed defending Jonathan.\n\nParagraph 9: In the second season, Arthur's relationships with Merlin and Morgana's maidservant, Guinevere, deepen. In \"The Once and Future Queen\", Arthur spent a few days living with Gwen while he entered a jousting tournament under an assumed name. Called out on his rude and inconsiderate behaviour by Gwen, Arthur slowly began to develop feelings for her, and they even shared their first kiss on the last day of the tournament. Shortly thereafter in the episode, \"Lancelot and Guinevere\", Arthur and Merlin raced to rescue Gwen after she was kidnapped by a warlord, Hengist. He was devastated to see then that Gwen had discovered that she had feelings for Lancelot, who had also tried to rescue her at this time. Arthur's stance on the subject of magic was also explored in the second season. In the episode, \"The Sins of the Father\", Arthur voiced the thought that it was possible that not all magic users were evil when Merlin cautioned him not to trust the sorceress, Morgause, too quickly. When Morgause subsequently engineered the revelation of the truth of Arthur's magic-induced birth, which resulted in the death of Arthur's mother, Arthur returned to Camelot and nearly killed Uther in a blind rage. He was only stopped when Merlin intervened, who tearfully claimed that Morgause had been lying and faked the story. Arthur later claimed to believe that all magic was evil, which visibly devastated Merlin. Arthur's relationship with Morgana was also developed in the second season. He was greatly concerned when she was thought to have been kidnapped by the Druids, and set off to rescue her in \"The Nightmare Begins\". In the penultimate episode, \"The Fires of Idirsholas\", Arthur was visibly devastated when Morgana was seemingly kidnapped by Morgause, blaming himself for having failed to protect her. In the finale episode, \"The Last Dragonlord\", Arthur was yet again called upon to defend Camelot against overwhelming odds. With the Great Dragon freed and repeatedly attacking Camelot, Arthur and Merlin set off in the faint hope that they could secure the aid of the last living Dragonlord, Balinor, who was also, unbeknownst to Arthur, Merlin's father. Though they eventually gained Balinor's willingness to help, mainly because Balinor was saved in the past by Gaius, the older man was killed on the journey back to Camelot. After returning to Camelot, Arthur gathered together a group of knights to make a final assault in the hope of defeating the dragon, even over Uther's protests. He led them and Merlin, who insisted on accompanying him, out into a field beyond Camelot to engage the dragon. Arthur stabbed the dragon with a lance, but was subsequently knocked out. When he came to, Merlin told him that he had dealt the dragon a mortal blow, when in reality Merlin used his new status as a Dragonlord to command it to cease its attack.\n\nParagraph 10: Male, female.

Using mahogany frames and the new marine plywood laminated with resorcinol glues, Rayner marked his return to the sea by building a 20-foot hard chine bilge keel gunter-rigged sloop \u2013 the Westcoaster \u2013 designed initially for a customer wishing to navigate the difficult waters and scarce harbours of the Bristol Channel, where Rayner had been torpedoed in 1944. Rayner gave the Westcoaster \"sitting head room for tall men\" \u2013 rare in yachts so small \u2013 while ingeniously camouflaging the reverse sheer needed for such generous accommodation by carrying the decks out to the sides of the boat as he had with Robinetta 20 years earlier. Similarly all the Westcoaster's running rigging came back to the cockpit making her easy to handle single-handed. He sailed and demonstrated the first of such yachts, painted a rich royal international blue \u2013 often called Oxford Blue \u2013 enthusing about its good looks, its affordability, its practicality for weekend \"pottering\" and fitness for deeper waters despite a draft of no more than 2'3\" (70\u00a0cm). This design ensemble was topped by Rayner's preference for the gunter rig, its short mast, compared to a Bermudian, making it easier to tow on a trailer, to lower and raise, for the bridges of inland waterways, as well as allowing a swift reef \u2013 by lowering the boom \u2013 in a squall. Rayner also wrote that he valued the greater 'lifting' quality of a gaff or gunter mainsail as compared to the Bermudian main, prior to the wider use, with that rig, of masthead Genoas \u2013 headsails of greater area than the mainsail \u2013 which in Rayner's view, in 1962, was 'the herald of rigs to come' with 'great aerodynamic efficiency and with enormous lift!', and returning, in effect, \"to the lateen-shaped loose-footed sails of the Mediterranean but with a taut forestay replacing the heavy lateen yard...\" A small number of Westcoasters were later modified by the addition of a small bowsprit, with the cutter rig giving an even greater sail area.", "answers": ["Paragraph 1"], "length": 3995, "dataset": "passage_retrieval_en_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "1ffe6e79a2ddb2071ed1e89427b5a130ed9c86e6fd11165e", "pred": "1."}

Records and released the eight-song mini-album What To Do About Them culled from a mix of previously available and unreleased home and studio recordings. Musician/cartoonist Ron Reg\u00e9, Jr. contributed artwork to the album's cover as well as lo-fi recordings that were woven into the record's sequence. The band also set to work recording their first LP, around which time shifts in Swirlies' personnel began to occur. Ben Drucker only drummed on a third of the new album's studio tracks, and for the remaining songs his parts were handed over to a pair of session drummers. In January 1993, Andy Bernick departed to pursue ornithology for the remainder of the academic year and Damon's former roommate Morgan Andrews was brought in to fill in on bass guitar and assorted noises. It was this lineup that toured to support What To Do About Them and that appeared in the video for \"Bell\" from Blonder Tongue Audio Baton, which had already been completed but was not yet released. Named for an obscure piece of vintage musical equipment, Blonder Tongue Audio Baton made use of Mellotron, Moog, and other analog artifacts that the group had unearthed in the studio. During sequencing the band threw in numerous lo-fi compositions, soundbites, and rants, and collaged together an album jacket from arrays of found images and objects that matched the album's eclectic aesthetics. Hailed for melding \"the high waters of shoegaze creativity and the mounting currents of indie rock\", Blonder Tongue Audio Baton quickly rose to prominence in the American noise pop canon.\n\nParagraph 2: Methley Hall was the former seat of the Earl of Mexborough.  During the fourteenth century the de Waterton family married into the de Methley family and moved to Methley Hall, a large, imposing and solid castellated building, mostly spread over three storeys rising to four by the turreted entrance. An eighteenth century watercolour shows a great hall with a minstrels gallery and grand staircase, decorated and embossed ceiling with a full-length oriel window. Young Richard Plantagenet, Richard of York, lived here from the ages of four to twelve, with Waterton's family until 1423 when national events changed things. Robert Waterton was the custodian of Richard II whilst constable of Pontefract Castle from 1399 and later gaoler of James I of Scotland.  He was esquire to Henry Bolingbroke, the future Henry IV.  The seat at Methley Hall was conferred in 1410 to Robert's brother John Waterton. The Hall, which featured in a 1907 edition of Country Life, was demolished in 1964, although the Mexborough Estate are still significant landowners in the district. Queen Mary (Mary of Teck), consort of H. M. King George V, visited the village in 1935 and stayed at the Hall as a guest of the Earl. Titus Salt leased Methley Hall from the Earl of Mexborough between 1856 and 1865 according to Salt's biographer Balgarnie.\n\nParagraph 3: President Viktor Yanukovych stated on 5 March 2010 he would make a decision to repeal the decrees to honor the title as Heroes of Ukraine to Shukhevych and fellow nationalist Stepan Bandera before the next Victory Day (in August 2011 he stated \"if we look at our past history and build our future based on this history, which had numerous contradictions, we will rob our future, which is wrong\"). Although the Hero of Ukraine decrees do not stipulate the possibility that a decree on awarding this title can be annulled, on 21 April 2010, Donetsk Administrative Court of Appeals declared unlawful former Ukrainian President Viktor Yuschenko's decree of 12 October 2007 to award the Hero of Ukraine title to Roman Shukhevych. The court ruled that the former President had had no right to confer this title to Shukhevych, because Shukhevych had died in 1950 and therefore he had not lived on the territory of independent Ukraine (after 1991). Consequently, Shukhevych was not a Ukrainian citizen, and this title could not be awarded to him. On 12 August 2010 the High Administrative Court of Ukraine dismissed suits to declare four decrees by President Viktor Yanukovych on awarding the Hero of Ukraine title to Soviet soldiers illegal and cancel them. The filer of these suit stated they were based on the same arguments used by Donetsk Administrative Court of Appeals that on 21 April satisfied an appeal that deprived Roman Shukhevych the Hero of Ukraine title, as Shukhevych was not a citizen of Ukraine. The title however was not rescinded, pending an appeal to the Supreme Administrative Court of Ukraine which set aside all previous court decisions on 17 February 2011. The Supreme Administrative Court of Ukraine ruled Shukhevych's Hero of Ukraine title illegal in August 2011. On 1 September 2011 former President Yuschenko filed an appeal at the Supreme Court of Ukraine with a request that it cancel the ruling by the Supreme Administrative Court of Ukraine.\n\nParagraph 4: The Post Office archives record that the first box in mainland Britain was erected in Botchergate, Carlisle, in 1853. This fact is commemorated today with a replica Penfold box, located outside the Old Town Hall in Carlisle city centre. The first six in London were installed on 11 April 1855. The earliest surviving British designs are four Butt boxes made in Gloucester for the Western Area. These are at Barnes Cross, near Sherborne, Dorset, inside the former Royal Naval Hospital, Stonehouse, Plymouth, in the Haverfordwest town museum (formerly at Merlin's Bridge) and in the British Postal Museum & Archive store at Debden (formerly at Ventnor railway station, Isle of Wight). All date from 1853 to 1859, with Barnes Cross being one of the later batch. The oldest pillar boxes still in use by the Royal Mail are at Framlingham in Suffolk; this pair were founded by Andrew Handyside and Company of Derby in 1856 and are at Double Street and College Road. A third octagonal pillar of this type was at Gosberton in Lincolnshire and is now in the Museum of Lincolnshire Life in Lincoln. 1856 also saw various designs introduced in Scotland and the Midlands. The postbox believed to be the oldest in Scotland, is a wall box which sits on the front of the Golspie Inn (formerly the Sutherland Arms Hotel); it carries the royal cypher of Queen Victoria and dates back to 1861.\n\nParagraph 5: To place multiferroic materials in their appropriate historical context, one also needs to consider magnetoelectric materials, in which an electric field modifies the magnetic properties and vice versa. While magnetoelectric materials are not necessarily multiferroic, all ferromagnetic ferroelectric multiferroics are linear magnetoelectrics, with an applied electric field inducing a change in magnetization linearly proportional to its magnitude. Magnetoelectric materials and the corresponding magnetoelectric effect have a longer history than multiferroics, shown in blue in the graph to the right. The first known mention of magnetoelectricity is in the 1959 Edition of Landau & Lifshitz' Electrodynamics of Continuous Media which has the following comment at the end of the section on piezoelectricity: \"Let us point out two more phenomena, which, in principle, could exist. One is piezomagnetism, which consists of linear coupling between a magnetic field in a solid and a deformation (analogous to piezoelectricity). The other is a linear coupling between magnetic and electric fields in a media, which would cause, for example, a magnetization proportional to an electric field. Both these phenomena could exist for certain classes of magnetocrystalline symmetry. We will not however discuss these phenomena in more detail because it seems that till present, presumably, they have not been observed in any substance.\" One year later, I. E. Dzyaloshinskii showed using symmetry arguments that the material Cr2O3 should have linear magnetoelectric behavior, and his prediction was rapidly verified by D. Astrov. Over the next decades, research on magnetoelectric materials continued steadily in a number of groups in Europe, in particular in the former Soviet Union and in the group of H. Schmid at U. Geneva. A series of East-West conferences entitled Magnetoelectric Interaction Phenomena in Crystals (MEIPIC) was held between 1973 (in Seattle) and 2009 (in Santa Barbara), and indeed the term \"multi-ferroic magnetoelectric\" was first used by H. Schmid in the proceedings of the 1993 MEIPIC conference (in Ascona).\n\nParagraph 6: Moved to Ripley, Ohio, December 25, then to Paducah, Ky., February 17, 1862.

About every third county and every third place in California had per capita incomes above the state average. Though somewhat counterintuitive, this implies that counties and places with per capita incomes even slightly exceeding that of the state can be classified as \"high income\" given the natural division of places into a top third (high), middle third (medium), and lower third (low) when ranked by per capita income. Hence, the upper third of all places in this ranking have a per capita income with a lower bound roughly equal to that of the state, about $30,000. The median place and county in California had a per capita income of roughly $25,000, and the lower third of both types of geographies had per capita incomes with an upper bound of about $20,000. Places and counties with the highest per capita income were concentrated in the San Francisco Bay Area, which has a relatively high cost of living. Those with the lowest per capita incomes were concentrated in the Central Valley, an economy in which agriculture assumes a primary role.\n\nParagraph 8: Linghu Chu stood for the imperial examinations in his youth, and in 781, during the reign of Emperor Daizong's son Emperor Dezong, when Linghu was 15, he passed the imperial examinations.  (Also among those passing the imperial examinations that year were Huangfu Bo and Xiao Mian, with whom he became friendly.)  It was said that the governor of Gui District (\u6842\u7ba1, headquartered in modern Guilin, Guangxi) Wang Gong () favored his talent and wanted to invite him to serve on staff.  Concerned that Linghu would decline, he made the request to Emperor Dezong directly.  As Linghu's father Linghu Chengjian was then still serving in Taiyuan, he wanted to stay in Taiyuan, but was thankful for Wang's high regard of him, so after he passed the imperial examinations he headed for Gui District's capital Guilin to thank Wang, but did not accept Wang's feasts and tours before he requested to return to Taiyuan to support his parents.  As a result of his actions, he gained a good reputation.  Later, as Li Shuo (), Yan Shou (), and Zheng Dan () successively served as the military governor (Jiedushi) of Hedong Circuit (), headquartered at Taiyuan, they had high opinions of Linghu Chu and thus invited him to serve on staff, and he eventually rose to be the military governor's assistant.  It was said that Linghu was highly intelligent, and whenever Emperor Dezong received reports from the military governor of Hedong and could tell that it was Linghu who drafted them, he had much praise for Linghu's writing.  In 801, when Zheng died suddenly without leaving instructions, the soldiers were disturbed and went into a near-mutiny state.  In the middle of the night, a number of soldiers gathered and forced Linghu, under the threats by swords, to head to the headquarters.  With the officers surrounding him, they ordered him to draft a final report for Zheng.  Despite the duress of swords, Linghu had little trouble drafting such a report, and when the report was read to the soldiers, all were touched by his words, thus calming a serious situation.  After his father died, he was known for his filial piety during the period of mourning.  He thereafter was summoned to the capital Chang'an to serve as You Shiyi (), a low-level consultant at the legislative bureau of government (\u4e2d\u66f8\u7701, Zhongshu Sheng), and thereafter served as Taichang Boshi (), a consultant at the ministry of worship (\u592a\u5e38\u5bfa, Taichang Si) and Libu Yuanwailang (), a low-level official at the ministry of rites (\u79ae\u90e8, Libu).  At some point, Linghu left governmental service to observe a period of mourning for his mother when she died.  After the mourning period was over, he was recalled to governmental service to serve as Xingbu Yuanwailang (), a low-level official at the ministry of justice (\u5211\u90e8, Xingbu).\n\nParagraph 9: For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty while serving with the Third Battalion, Twenty-Third Marines, Fourth Marine Division, in combat against enemy Japanese forces during the seizure of Iwo Jima in the Volcano Islands, February 26, 1945. Promptly destroying a stubborn 20-mm. antiaircraft gun and its crew after assuming the duties of a bazooka man who had been killed, Private First Class Jacobson waged a relentless battle as his unit fought desperately toward the summit of Hill 382 in an effort to penetrate the heart of Japanese cross-island defenses. Employing his weapon with ready accuracy when his platoon was halted by overwhelming enemy fire on February 26, he first destroyed two hostile machine-gun positions, then attacked a large blockhouse, completely neutralizing the fortification before dispatching the five-man crew of a pillbox and exploding the installation with a terrific demolitions blast. Moving steadily forward, he wiped out an earth-covered rifle emplacement and, confronted by a cluster of similar emplacements which constituted the perimeter of enemy defenses in his assigned sector, fearlessly advanced, quickly reduced all six positions to a shambles, killed ten of the enemy and enabled our forces to occupy the strong point. Determined to widen the breach thus forced, he volunteered his services to an adjacent assault company, neutralized a pillbox holding up its advance, opened fire on a Japanese tank pouring a steady stream of bullets on one of our supporting tanks and smashed the enemy tank's gun turret in a brief but furious action culminating in a single-handed assault against still another blockhouse and the subsequent neutralization of its firepower. By his dauntless skill and valor, Private First Class Jacobson destroyed a total of sixteen enemy positions and annihilated approximately seventy-five Japanese, thereby contributing essentially to the success of his division's operations against the fanatically defended outpost of the Japanese Empire. His gallant conduct in the face of tremendous odds enhanced and sustained the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service.\n\nParagraph 10: Like other Land Rover vehicles, most of the Range Rover's bodywork skin is constructed from lightweight aluminium, except for the two-section rear upper and lower tailgates, the rear corners adjacent to the tailgate and the bonnet on all but the earliest models. Apart from minor cosmetic changes, the body design changed very little in its first decade. However, while utility Land Rovers had body panels rolled from a single sheet of aluminium, the Range Rover used aluminium panels hung on a steel 'safety frame' (a method pioneered with great success on the Rover P6 saloon). This allowed the bodywork of the Range Rover to carry much greater structural strength with the steel frame while retaining the corrosion-resistant and easily repaired aluminium outer panels.

Records and released the eight-song mini-album What To Do About Them culled from a mix of previously available and unreleased home and studio recordings. Musician/cartoonist Ron Reg\u00e9, Jr. contributed artwork to the album's cover as well as lo-fi recordings that were woven into the record's sequence. The band also set to work recording their first LP, around which time shifts in Swirlies' personnel began to occur. Ben Drucker only drummed on a third of the new album's studio tracks, and for the remaining songs his parts were handed over to a pair of session drummers. In January 1993, Andy Bernick departed to pursue ornithology for the remainder of the academic year and Damon's former roommate Morgan Andrews was brought in to fill in on bass guitar and assorted noises. It was this lineup that toured to support What To Do About Them and that appeared in the video for \"Bell\" from Blonder Tongue Audio Baton, which had already been completed but was not yet released. Named for an obscure piece of vintage musical equipment, Blonder Tongue Audio Baton made use of Mellotron, Moog, and other analog artifacts that the group had unearthed in the studio. During sequencing the band threw in numerous lo-fi compositions, soundbites, and rants, and collaged together an album jacket from arrays of found images and objects that matched the album's eclectic aesthetics. Hailed for melding \"the high waters of shoegaze creativity and the mounting currents of indie rock\", Blonder Tongue Audio Baton quickly rose to prominence in the American noise pop canon.\n\nParagraph 2: Methley Hall was the former seat of the Earl of Mexborough.  During the fourteenth century the de Waterton family married into the de Methley family and moved to Methley Hall, a large, imposing and solid castellated building, mostly spread over three storeys rising to four by the turreted entrance. An eighteenth century watercolour shows a great hall with a minstrels gallery and grand staircase, decorated and embossed ceiling with a full-length oriel window. Young Richard Plantagenet, Richard of York, lived here from the ages of four to twelve, with Waterton's family until 1423 when national events changed things. Robert Waterton was the custodian of Richard II whilst constable of Pontefract Castle from 1399 and later gaoler of James I of Scotland.  He was esquire to Henry Bolingbroke, the future Henry IV.  The seat at Methley Hall was conferred in 1410 to Robert's brother John Waterton. The Hall, which featured in a 1907 edition of Country Life, was demolished in 1964, although the Mexborough Estate are still significant landowners in the district. Queen Mary (Mary of Teck), consort of H. M. King George V, visited the village in 1935 and stayed at the Hall as a guest of the Earl. Titus Salt leased Methley Hall from the Earl of Mexborough between 1856 and 1865 according to Salt's biographer Balgarnie.\n\nParagraph 3: President Viktor Yanukovych stated on 5 March 2010 he would make a decision to repeal the decrees to honor the title as Heroes of Ukraine to Shukhevych and fellow nationalist Stepan Bandera before the next Victory Day (in August 2011 he stated \"if we look at our past history and build our future based on this history, which had numerous contradictions, we will rob our future, which is wrong\"). Although the Hero of Ukraine decrees do not stipulate the possibility that a decree on awarding this title can be annulled, on 21 April 2010, Donetsk Administrative Court of Appeals declared unlawful former Ukrainian President Viktor Yuschenko's decree of 12 October 2007 to award the Hero of Ukraine title to Roman Shukhevych. The court ruled that the former President had had no right to confer this title to Shukhevych, because Shukhevych had died in 1950 and therefore he had not lived on the territory of independent Ukraine (after 1991). Consequently, Shukhevych was not a Ukrainian citizen, and this title could not be awarded to him. On 12 August 2010 the High Administrative Court of Ukraine dismissed suits to declare four decrees by President Viktor Yanukovych on awarding the Hero of Ukraine title to Soviet soldiers illegal and cancel them. The filer of these suit stated they were based on the same arguments used by Donetsk Administrative Court of Appeals that on 21 April satisfied an appeal that deprived Roman Shukhevych the Hero of Ukraine title, as Shukhevych was not a citizen of Ukraine. The title however was not rescinded, pending an appeal to the Supreme Administrative Court of Ukraine which set aside all previous court decisions on 17 February 2011. The Supreme Administrative Court of Ukraine ruled Shukhevych's Hero of Ukraine title illegal in August 2011. On 1 September 2011 former President Yuschenko filed an appeal at the Supreme Court of Ukraine with a request that it cancel the ruling by the Supreme Administrative Court of Ukraine.\n\nParagraph 4: The Post Office archives record that the first box in mainland Britain was erected in Botchergate, Carlisle, in 1853. This fact is commemorated today with a replica Penfold box, located outside the Old Town Hall in Carlisle city centre. The first six in London were installed on 11 April 1855. The earliest surviving British designs are four Butt boxes made in Gloucester for the Western Area. These are at Barnes Cross, near Sherborne, Dorset, inside the former Royal Naval Hospital, Stonehouse, Plymouth, in the Haverfordwest town museum (formerly at Merlin's Bridge) and in the British Postal Museum & Archive store at Debden (formerly at Ventnor railway station, Isle of Wight). All date from 1853 to 1859, with Barnes Cross being one of the later batch. The oldest pillar boxes still in use by the Royal Mail are at Framlingham in Suffolk; this pair were founded by Andrew Handyside and Company of Derby in 1856 and are at Double Street and College Road. A third octagonal pillar of this type was at Gosberton in Lincolnshire and is now in the Museum of Lincolnshire Life in Lincoln. 1856 also saw various designs introduced in Scotland and the Midlands. The postbox believed to be the oldest in Scotland, is a wall box which sits on the front of the Golspie Inn (formerly the Sutherland Arms Hotel); it carries the royal cypher of Queen Victoria and dates back to 1861.\n\nParagraph 5: To place multiferroic materials in their appropriate historical context, one also needs to consider magnetoelectric materials, in which an electric field modifies the magnetic properties and vice versa. While magnetoelectric materials are not necessarily multiferroic, all ferromagnetic ferroelectric multiferroics are linear magnetoelectrics, with an applied electric field inducing a change in magnetization linearly proportional to its magnitude. Magnetoelectric materials and the corresponding magnetoelectric effect have a longer history than multiferroics, shown in blue in the graph to the right. The first known mention of magnetoelectricity is in the 1959 Edition of Landau & Lifshitz' Electrodynamics of Continuous Media which has the following comment at the end of the section on piezoelectricity: \"Let us point out two more phenomena, which, in principle, could exist. One is piezomagnetism, which consists of linear coupling between a magnetic field in a solid and a deformation (analogous to piezoelectricity). The other is a linear coupling between magnetic and electric fields in a media, which would cause, for example, a magnetization proportional to an electric field. Both these phenomena could exist for certain classes of magnetocrystalline symmetry. We will not however discuss these phenomena in more detail because it seems that till present, presumably, they have not been observed in any substance.\" One year later, I. E. Dzyaloshinskii showed using symmetry arguments that the material Cr2O3 should have linear magnetoelectric behavior, and his prediction was rapidly verified by D. Astrov. Over the next decades, research on magnetoelectric materials continued steadily in a number of groups in Europe, in particular in the former Soviet Union and in the group of H. Schmid at U. Geneva. A series of East-West conferences entitled Magnetoelectric Interaction Phenomena in Crystals (MEIPIC) was held between 1973 (in Seattle) and 2009 (in Santa Barbara), and indeed the term \"multi-ferroic magnetoelectric\" was first used by H. Schmid in the proceedings of the 1993 MEIPIC conference (in Ascona).\n\nParagraph 6: Moved to Ripley, Ohio, December 25, then to Paducah, Ky., February 17, 1862.

About every third county and every third place in California had per capita incomes above the state average. Though somewhat counterintuitive, this implies that counties and places with per capita incomes even slightly exceeding that of the state can be classified as \"high income\" given the natural division of places into a top third (high), middle third (medium), and lower third (low) when ranked by per capita income. Hence, the upper third of all places in this ranking have a per capita income with a lower bound roughly equal to that of the state, about $30,000. The median place and county in California had a per capita income of roughly $25,000, and the lower third of both types of geographies had per capita incomes with an upper bound of about $20,000. Places and counties with the highest per capita income were concentrated in the San Francisco Bay Area, which has a relatively high cost of living. Those with the lowest per capita incomes were concentrated in the Central Valley, an economy in which agriculture assumes a primary role.\n\nParagraph 8: Linghu Chu stood for the imperial examinations in his youth, and in 781, during the reign of Emperor Daizong's son Emperor Dezong, when Linghu was 15, he passed the imperial examinations.  (Also among those passing the imperial examinations that year were Huangfu Bo and Xiao Mian, with whom he became friendly.)  It was said that the governor of Gui District (\u6842\u7ba1, headquartered in modern Guilin, Guangxi) Wang Gong () favored his talent and wanted to invite him to serve on staff.  Concerned that Linghu would decline, he made the request to Emperor Dezong directly.  As Linghu's father Linghu Chengjian was then still serving in Taiyuan, he wanted to stay in Taiyuan, but was thankful for Wang's high regard of him, so after he passed the imperial examinations he headed for Gui District's capital Guilin to thank Wang, but did not accept Wang's feasts and tours before he requested to return to Taiyuan to support his parents.  As a result of his actions, he gained a good reputation.  Later, as Li Shuo (), Yan Shou (), and Zheng Dan () successively served as the military governor (Jiedushi) of Hedong Circuit (), headquartered at Taiyuan, they had high opinions of Linghu Chu and thus invited him to serve on staff, and he eventually rose to be the military governor's assistant.  It was said that Linghu was highly intelligent, and whenever Emperor Dezong received reports from the military governor of Hedong and could tell that it was Linghu who drafted them, he had much praise for Linghu's writing.  In 801, when Zheng died suddenly without leaving instructions, the soldiers were disturbed and went into a near-mutiny state.  In the middle of the night, a number of soldiers gathered and forced Linghu, under the threats by swords, to head to the headquarters.  With the officers surrounding him, they ordered him to draft a final report for Zheng.  Despite the duress of swords, Linghu had little trouble drafting such a report, and when the report was read to the soldiers, all were touched by his words, thus calming a serious situation.  After his father died, he was known for his filial piety during the period of mourning.  He thereafter was summoned to the capital Chang'an to serve as You Shiyi (), a low-level consultant at the legislative bureau of government (\u4e2d\u66f8\u7701, Zhongshu Sheng), and thereafter served as Taichang Boshi (), a consultant at the ministry of worship (\u592a\u5e38\u5bfa, Taichang Si) and Libu Yuanwailang (), a low-level official at the ministry of rites (\u79ae\u90e8, Libu).  At some point, Linghu left governmental service to observe a period of mourning for his mother when she died.  After the mourning period was over, he was recalled to governmental service to serve as Xingbu Yuanwailang (), a low-level official at the ministry of justice (\u5211\u90e8, Xingbu).\n\nParagraph 9: For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty while serving with the Third Battalion, Twenty-Third Marines, Fourth Marine Division, in combat against enemy Japanese forces during the seizure of Iwo Jima in the Volcano Islands, February 26, 1945. Promptly destroying a stubborn 20-mm. antiaircraft gun and its crew after assuming the duties of a bazooka man who had been killed, Private First Class Jacobson waged a relentless battle as his unit fought desperately toward the summit of Hill 382 in an effort to penetrate the heart of Japanese cross-island defenses. Employing his weapon with ready accuracy when his platoon was halted by overwhelming enemy fire on February 26, he first destroyed two hostile machine-gun positions, then attacked a large blockhouse, completely neutralizing the fortification before dispatching the five-man crew of a pillbox and exploding the installation with a terrific demolitions blast. Moving steadily forward, he wiped out an earth-covered rifle emplacement and, confronted by a cluster of similar emplacements which constituted the perimeter of enemy defenses in his assigned sector, fearlessly advanced, quickly reduced all six positions to a shambles, killed ten of the enemy and enabled our forces to occupy the strong point. Determined to widen the breach thus forced, he volunteered his services to an adjacent assault company, neutralized a pillbox holding up its advance, opened fire on a Japanese tank pouring a steady stream of bullets on one of our supporting tanks and smashed the enemy tank's gun turret in a brief but furious action culminating in a single-handed assault against still another blockhouse and the subsequent neutralization of its firepower. By his dauntless skill and valor, Private First Class Jacobson destroyed a total of sixteen enemy positions and annihilated approximately seventy-five Japanese, thereby contributing essentially to the success of his division's operations against the fanatically defended outpost of the Japanese Empire. His gallant conduct in the face of tremendous odds enhanced and sustained the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service.\n\nParagraph 10: Like other Land Rover vehicles, most of the Range Rover's bodywork skin is constructed from lightweight aluminium, except for the two-section rear upper and lower tailgates, the rear corners adjacent to the tailgate and the bonnet on all but the earliest models. Apart from minor cosmetic changes, the body design changed very little in its first decade. However, while utility Land Rovers had body panels rolled from a single sheet of aluminium, the Range Rover used aluminium panels hung on a steel 'safety frame' (a method pioneered with great success on the Rover P6 saloon). This allowed the bodywork of the Range Rover to carry much greater structural strength with the steel frame while retaining the corrosion-resistant and easily repaired aluminium outer panels. While the steel frame was designed by the engineering team, it was expected that Rover's stylist David Bache would provide a design for the outer panels for use on the production vehicles. For the prototypes the engineers designed their own functional body panels simply to protect the occupants and to allow the vehicles to be driven legally on the road. However the clean, square-cut and functional design of the prototype was deemed so good that Bache only altered the detailing, such as providing a different front grille and headlamp design.  The Range Rover also marked the first appearance of Bache's trademark \"symmetric\" dashboard, where a common moulding was used for the fascia superstructure on both RHD and LHD versions, onto which the pod-style instrument binnacle was simply mounted on the appropriate side \u2013 Bache would use this concept again on both the Rover SD1 and the Austin Metro in later years.  The original fascia would later be nicknamed the \"Airfix Dashboard\" by Range Rover enthusiasts owing to its hard, low quality plastics which, as the vehicle moved upmarket over the years, betrayed its humble beginnings as a utility vehicle, It remained with the Range Rover up until the very last years of production when it was replaced by the \"soft dash\" (see below)\n\nParagraph 11: Moved to Lexington, Kentucky, September 1861, and duty there until October 1.

{"prompt": "Here are 30 paragraphs from Wikipedia, along with an abstract. Please determine which paragraph the abstract is from.\n\nParagraph 1: In recent years, Cerulo has worked to establish a dialog between cognitive neuroscience and cognitive sociology.  Her edited collection, Culture in Mind: Toward a Sociology of Culture and Cognition, as well as several review pieces  suggest viable links between these disciplines' approach to conceptualization and schematization, habituation and attention, nurturance and attachment, cognitive styles, and memory storage. Cerulo's book Never Saw It Coming: Cultural Challenges to Envisioning the Worst  also forwarded this agenda.  In it, she builds on two cognitive scientific ideas, prototyping and graded membership, to explain a sociocultural phenomenon she calls \"positive asymmetry\"\u2014i.e. a blind optimism associated with a disregard for worst-case scenarios.  Cerulo's work documents the widespread nature of positive asymmetry, tracking its influence in key events in the life cycle, the sites of work and play, and in the organizations and bureaucracies that structure social life.  She shows that while definitions of best and worst change over time and place, the tendency to prioritize the best is rather constant.  Most communities maintain cultural practices (what she calls \"eclipsing\", \"clouding\" and \"recasting\") that background materials dealing with worst-cases or negative concepts.  Her work also identifies certain structural conditions under which these cultural practices are more or less likely to be used.  \"In a daring extrapolation, Cerulo argues that this individual grading is recapitulated in cultural cognition.\" She suggests that the cultural practices associated with positive asymmetry harness the brain's propensity toward asymmetrical thinking.  The practices take the mechanic of human brain operations and encode that process into a much more targeted and specialized experiential bias. Cerulo's work concludes by reviewing both the helpful and debilitating consequences of positive asymmetry.  She also questions whether this highly entrenched phenomenon can ever (or should ever) be corrected. Organizations expert Karl Weick says of the book, \"This book is a welcome addition to an already growing literature on worst cases \u2026 What Cerulo adds to this mix is a mechanism, a catalog of cultural practices that make it difficult for people to envision the worst, a broader range of settings in which this imbalance plays out, initial efforts to characterize settings where negative symmetry is acceptable and encouraged, insistence that the unique details of worst cases are what is important, and a solid grounding at the individual level of analysis with the cognitive principle of \u2018graded membership\u2019.\" Journalist Barbara Ehrenreich called the book \"remarkable\" as it \"recounts a number of ways that the habit of positive thinking \u2026 undermined preparedness and invited disaster.\" The book was the topic of an \"Author Meets Critics\" session at the 2008 Annual Meeting of the American Sociological Association. In an effort to spotlight Cerulo's critiques of the optimism agendas forwarded in books such as Rhonda Byrne's The Secret, writer John Gravois initiated a campaign in Slate magazine to have Cerulo interviewed on The Oprah Winfrey Show.  \"The Secret tells us to visualize best-case scenarios and banish negative ones from our minds,\" wrote Gravois. \"Never Saw It Coming says that's what we've been doing all along\u2014and we get blindsided by even the most foreseeable disasters because of it.\"\n\nParagraph 2: Pieter van der Aa began his career at Leiden in 1683 as a Latin trade publisher, publishing classical texts pertaining to medicine and science. As he progressed, he began to publish atlases and maps, compiling numerous multi-volume collections of works. His ambition to become Leiden's most famous printer was fulfilled in 1715 with his appointment to head printer for the city and its university. One of Pieter van der Aa's largest compilations relates to the history of Italy and Sicily, an area of immense personal interest. Though he took credit for many of his compilations, several, such as the Dutch collection of travels to the East and West Indies, were admittedly simple improvements to others' works.\n\nParagraph 3: The seat has a substantial Muslim population in the town of Dewsbury (particularly the Savile Town district), combined a few suburban and rural affluent parts such as Denby Dale, Mirfield, and Kirkburton.  The town of Dewsbury itself is strongly Labour, and the remaining wards mostly Conservative. Overall the seat has close to national average income and several developments have desirable views as the upland town cuts into the Pennines. Relatively few people rely upon social housing, however the Dewsbury East ward contains a high proportion of social housing in the Chickenley estate, while Dewsbury South contains the Thornhill area, where the local school was the subject of the acclaimed Educating Yorkshire series. In the light of increasing concern over Muslim extremism, the Labour Party candidate Shahid Malik enjoyed a fairly large public media profile after his victory in 2005, with various TV appearances and interviews, strongly denouncing believers in and adherents of such views; however, this has also been a strong area for the British National Party, who obtained their highest vote in Britain (13.1%) in the 2005 general election, much of it taken at the Labour Party's expense. They have also had a substantial vote at local level, when in 2006 for the first time in the UK the BNP polled more votes than any other party standing. However, at the 2010 general election, the BNP's popularity in Dewsbury fell (despite a substantial nationwide rise in support for the party compared to five years previously) and they gained a mere 6% of the vote.\n\nParagraph 4: In 1997, Twain followed with Come On Over, which topped Top Country Albums for a record 50 non-consecutive weeks and had tremendous pop crossover success. It peaked at number two on the Billboard 200 and remained in the top 10 for a total of 53 weeks, making it the longest-running top 10 album by a country artist at the time. Certified 20 times platinum (double diamond) by the RIAA and with 15.5 million copies sold, Come On Over established itself as one of the best-selling albums of all time in the US and was once the best-selling album of the Nielsen SoundScan era; it now ranks second behind Metallica's 1991 eponymous album. In Canada, it reached similar success and was certified double diamond by Music Canada. In 1998, Come On Over was released internationally, duplicating the commercial success it encountered in North America. It became one of the best-selling albums in several countries, including Australia and the United Kingdom. With a total of 40 million copies sold worldwide, Come On Over also became one of the best-selling albums worldwide. Furthermore, the album is the best-selling album by a female artist in any genre and the best-selling country album of all time. A total of 12 singles were released from the album. Three (\"Love Gets Me Every Time\", \"You're Still the One\" and \"Honey, I'm Home\") topped Hot Country Singles & Tracks. A total of 10 songs charted within the top 10 of the chart, marking the most top 10 appearances from one album on Hot Country Singles & Tracks. Several performed well internationally, namely \"You're Still the One\", \"From This Moment On\", \"That Don't Impress Me Much\", \"Man! I Feel Like a Woman!\", and \"Don't Be Stupid (You Know I Love You)\", all of which received platinum certifications by the ARIA (ARIA).\n\nParagraph 5: Fox began to develop a TV series centered on James Gordon's early days as a police detective and the origin stories of various Batman villains in September 2013. McKenzie was cast as the lead character. When describing his character in an interview, McKenzie stated that Gordon \"is a truly honest man. The last honest man in a city full of crooked people. He's not an anti-hero, he's a true hero \u2013 but he will have to compromise\". McKenzie did not audition for the role. Heller, with whom he had worked before, wrote the role for McKenzie, who described the character as \"an old-fashioned hero in an age of anti-heroes. A throwback. Jim's a lawman, that restricts him in some ways. But also means he can become powerful within the system and change things for the better\". In the show, Gordon is assigned to investigate the murder of Thomas and Martha Wayne, with Bruce being the surviving witness. During the first season, he is assigned with a new partner, Harvey Bullock, serving also to police captain Sarah Essen. In addition to the Wayne's murder case, Gordon solves various cases in Gotham, some of them which are connected to the powerful mob figures, like Fish Mooney, Carmine Falcone and Sal Maroni. Jim also fights against corruption in the GCPD, like the police commissioner Gillian B. Loeb and Narcotics Officer Arnold Flass. To better fight against criminals and corrupt cops, Gordon gets allies such as police detectives Renee Montoya and Crispus Allen and District Attorney Harvey Dent. Gordon soon becomes reluctant ally to a criminal named Oswald Cobblepot, often calling him for the favor in some cases. He also meets a small street thief Selina Kyle, who reluctantly helps him regarding the Wayne murders. At one point when is assigned to Arkham Asylum, he meets physician Leslie Thompkins who works in female ward, later working as a medical examiner in GCPD. Gordon later falls in love with her; he was previously in relationship with Barbara Kean, but due to his police duty and her life put in danger by crime families, he advised her to temporarily leave him until they meet again. When Barbara sees Gordon and Leslie together, she becomes heartbroken and later psychotic. When the gang war reaches climax, Gordon and Bullock attempt to save Carmine Falcone. He, Falcone, Oswald and Butch Gilzean are captured by Fish Mooney and her gang. When Sal Maroni advises her to join, calling her \"babe\", she shoots him. Gordon manages to end gang war, but Cobblepot kills Fish Mooney in her apparent death when she falls in the river, becoming a new king of Gotham.\n\nParagraph 6: I know this man from Afghanistan when he visited me in my own home begging me for some help.  I did not have anything to offer [him].  But when I looked at his overall look and his dirty clothing he had on, he looked so miserable.  So I went to another friend of mine and asked him for money.  That person gave me about $3 and I gave it to ISN 758.  I have invited him to stay at my house for that particular night, but he refused.  This person came back to me again (meaning ISN 758) asking me for more money that I didn't have to give him.  I also learned from other people that this person was addicted to Hash, he smokes grass.  This was a reason that made me decide not to help him because every time I would help him he would spend it on Hash.  To me he was not a political person, a religious person, or a military person.  I have never heard once that he hated America or  allies.  I never heard that he really served with the Taliban.  He received some help from the Taliban like other Iraqi refugees, and I am one of them.  I am one of them and I have received help from the Taliban.  They only gave me food for my family and me.  They gave me a house to stay with my family.  In regards to 758, they did not give him a house because he was not married.  They only gave [one] to me.  He is a peaceful man and he does not pose a threat on nobody and he has parents that need him.  Anything that happened between him and me, like some kind of animosity was a result of the investigators here on this facility.  So they can create animosity between the two of use .  I was exposed to a lot of abuse, psychological abuse from the investigators and God only knows what happened.  This person ISN 758 is innocent from any allegations and God knows everything.  This is what I have and peace be upon [you].\n\nParagraph 7: Over the real or complex numbers, the blowup has a topological description as the connected sum .  Assume that P is the origin in A2 \u2286 P2, and write L for the line at infinity.  A2 \\ {0} has an inversion map t which sends (x, y) to (x/(|x|2 + |y|2), y/(|x|2 + |y|2)).  t is the circle inversion with respect to the unit sphere S: It fixes S, preserves each line through the origin, and exchanges the inside of the sphere with the outside. t extends to a continuous map P2 \\ {0} \u2192 A2 by sending the line at infinity to the origin.  This extension, which we also denote t, can be used to construct the blowup.  Let C denote the complement of the unit ball. The blowup X is the manifold obtained by attaching two copies of C along S.  X comes with a map \u03c0 to P2 which is the identity on the first copy of C and t on the second copy of C.  This map is an isomorphism away from P, and the fiber over P is the line at infinity in the second copy of C. Each point in this line corresponds to a unique line through the origin, so the fiber over \u03c0 corresponds to the possible normal directions through the origin.\n\nParagraph 8: Semple has sent \"Happy Clouds\" up into the sky over London initially in direct response to the recession and also in a bid to highlight and spread happiness worldwide, being invited to repeat the artwork in Dublin, Moscow, Australia and Milan.\"Happy Clouds By Stuart Semple\" , \"[Wallpaper Magazine]\", 23 April 2009.

The first two quatrains work together, illustrating both the scentless canker bloom  and the scented rose. In the first two lines of the first quatrain he says that beauty seems more beauteous as a result of truth. In the next two he gives the example of a rose. He says that beyond its looks, we prize the rose for its scent. This scent is its \"truth\" or essence. In the second quatrain Shakespeare compares the rose to the canker bloom. They have similar in ways other than scent. Shakespeare's use of the words \"play\" and \"wantonly\" together implies that \"play\" has a sexual connotation. In the third quatrain the author compares the death of the two flowers. The canker bloom dies alone and \"unrespected\", while roses do not die alone, for \"of their sweet deaths are sweetest odours made\". The final couplet indicates that the young man, or perhaps that which is beauteous and lovely, will enjoy a second life in verse, while that which is meaningless and shallow will be forgotten. This distillation metaphor can be compared to sonnet 5, where marriage was the distiller and beauty was distilled. In either sonnet one gets the same result from the distillation process, which is beauty. However, in sonnet 5 the distillation process is through marriage, and in sonnet 54 it is through verse. \"Vade\" in the final line is often used in a sense similar to \"fade\", but \"vade\" has stronger connotations of decay.  In 1768, Edward Capell altered the final line by replacing the quarto's \"by\" with \"my\". This alteration was generally followed through the 19th Century. More recent editors do not favor this alteration, as it narrows the meaning from the larger principles of the sonnet.\n\nParagraph 10: Shakib Khan was born on 28 March 1979 as Masud Rana in Ragadhi, Muksudpur, Gopalganj, Bangladesh. Khan's original residence is Maksudpur Upazila of Gopalganj district. His father Abdur Rab was a government officer and his mother Nurjahan is a housewife. The other members of his family are a sister and a brother. He grew up as a teenager in Narayanganj district due to his father's job. His father's job required the family to relocate frequently from one city to another during his school years. In many interviews he said that he did not mind travelling and changing schools. During his ninth grade, when he was residing with his family in Narayanganj, he became interested in Martial arts. After that he has done a course in Martial arts. In his childhood he dreamt to become a doctor or engineer. He was a bright student and did brilliant results in Secondary School Certificate (SSC) and Higher Secondary School Certificate (HSC) exams but discontinued his study after getting chance to act in films. Besides education, he also had an interest in dancing. Khan met film choreographer and actor Aziz Reza in 1995, and then completed a dancing course under Aziz Reza. In 1998, one day he went to Bangladesh Film Development Corporation (BFDC), the only major studio of Bangladesh on a random visit with Aziz Reza, where he met a photographer who asked him to take part in a photoshoot. During the photoshoot, film director Abul Khair Bulbul noticed Khan and offered him to play lead role in his film and he accept the offered. Although eventually the production of the film did not began. Later he get an offer for Rafiqul Islam's 1998 romantic project Sobai to Shukhi Hote Chay directed by Aftab Khan Tulu. Khan accepted the offer and first time stand on camera. The film was delayed being release, which was later released in the following year. At that time, director Sohanur Rahman Sohan was looking for a new hero due to a dispute with actor Shakil Khan. In two deferent interviews with Kaler Kantho and Chiti Aziz Reza said that he very much requested Sohanur Rahman Sohan to give a chance Shakib Khan in his film. Sohan agreed to his request and asked to bring Shakib Khan to their office. Sohan then gave him a chance as a lead actor for his upcoming project and later made his debut with Ananta Bhalobasha (1999) directed by Sohanur Rahman Sohan. He was paid only 5,000 for those initial films.\n\nParagraph 11: Antoine Albeau holds the windsurfing speed record (on the 500-metre course) with a speed of 53.27 knots (  2015, L\u00fcderitz speed canal, Namibia, beating his own previous record of 49.09 knots (90,91\u00a0km/h) from 2008, on the purpose built Saintes Marie de la Mer canal in Southern France.  The previous record of 48.7 knots (90,19\u00a0km/h) was held by Finian Maynard, an Irish born windsurfer who sails for the British Virgin Islands who achieved this speed on 10 April 2005 on the same purpose built canal. Between 1988 and 2009, A total of 8 Outright Sailing Speed Records were set on  The Canal  in Saintes Marie De la Mer Starting with the first Outright record above 40 Knots by British speed windsurfer  Erik Beale at 40.48 Knots, 1988 and subsequent records by Pascal Maka , 42.91 Knots, 1990, Thierry Bielak , 45.34, 1993 Finian Maynard , 48.70 ,2008 and finally Antoine Albeau  49.09 , 2009. Windsurfers are not as efficient as the larger boats used in record attempts.  Albeau's 49.09 knot record was set in winds of 45 to 50 knots, while the Yellow Pages Endeavour, which held a record of 46.52 knots from 1993 to 2004, was optimized to sail in a 19 knot wind.  Venue has much to do with the windsurfer's success, as all windsurfing 500m records since 1988 have been made at the same canal. Zara Davis holds the outright nautical mile record for a woman. Set in Walvis Bay Namibia an open water venue in November 2006 previous record was held by Valerie Ghibaudo of France\n\nThe following is an abstract.\n\nThe speaker recounts their encounter with a man from Afghanistan who visited their home seeking help.

Her edited collection, Culture in Mind: Toward a Sociology of Culture and Cognition, as well as several review pieces  suggest viable links between these disciplines' approach to conceptualization and schematization, habituation and attention, nurturance and attachment, cognitive styles, and memory storage. Cerulo's book Never Saw It Coming: Cultural Challenges to Envisioning the Worst  also forwarded this agenda.  In it, she builds on two cognitive scientific ideas, prototyping and graded membership, to explain a sociocultural phenomenon she calls \"positive asymmetry\"\u2014i.e. a blind optimism associated with a disregard for worst-case scenarios.  Cerulo's work documents the widespread nature of positive asymmetry, tracking its influence in key events in the life cycle, the sites of work and play, and in the organizations and bureaucracies that structure social life.  She shows that while definitions of best and worst change over time and place, the tendency to prioritize the best is rather constant.  Most communities maintain cultural practices (what she calls \"eclipsing\", \"clouding\" and \"recasting\") that background materials dealing with worst-cases or negative concepts.  Her work also identifies certain structural conditions under which these cultural practices are more or less likely to be used.  \"In a daring extrapolation, Cerulo argues that this individual grading is recapitulated in cultural cognition.\" She suggests that the cultural practices associated with positive asymmetry harness the brain's propensity toward asymmetrical thinking.  The practices take the mechanic of human brain operations and encode that process into a much more targeted and specialized experiential bias. Cerulo's work concludes by reviewing both the helpful and debilitating consequences of positive asymmetry.

They have similar in ways other than scent. Shakespeare's use of the words \"play\" and \"wantonly\" together implies that \"play\" has a sexual connotation. In the third quatrain the author compares the death of the two flowers. The canker bloom dies alone and \"unrespected\", while roses do not die alone, for \"of their sweet deaths are sweetest odours made\". The final couplet indicates that the young man, or perhaps that which is beauteous and lovely, will enjoy a second life in verse, while that which is meaningless and shallow will be forgotten. This distillation metaphor can be compared to sonnet 5, where marriage was the distiller and beauty was distilled. In either sonnet one gets the same result from the distillation process, which is beauty. However, in sonnet 5 the distillation process is through marriage, and in sonnet 54 it is through verse. \"Vade\" in the final line is often used in a sense similar to \"fade\", but \"vade\" has stronger connotations of decay.  In 1768, Edward Capell altered the final line by replacing the quarto's \"by\" with \"my\". This alteration was generally followed through the 19th Century. More recent editors do not favor this alteration, as it narrows the meaning from the larger principles of the sonnet.\n\nParagraph 10: Shakib Khan was born on 28 March 1979 as Masud Rana in Ragadhi, Muksudpur, Gopalganj, Bangladesh. Khan's original residence is Maksudpur Upazila of Gopalganj district. His father Abdur Rab was a government officer and his mother Nurjahan is a housewife.

The previous record of 48.7 knots (90,19\u00a0km/h) was held by Finian Maynard, an Irish born windsurfer who sails for the British Virgin Islands who achieved this speed on 10 April 2005 on the same purpose built canal. Between 1988 and 2009, A total of 8 Outright Sailing Speed Records were set on  The Canal  in Saintes Marie De la Mer Starting with the first Outright record above 40 Knots by British speed windsurfer  Erik Beale at 40.48 Knots, 1988 and subsequent records by Pascal Maka , 42.91 Knots, 1990, Thierry Bielak , 45.34, 1993 Finian Maynard , 48.70 ,2008 and finally Antoine Albeau  49.09 , 2009. Windsurfers are not as efficient as the larger boats used in record attempts.  Albeau's 49.09 knot record was set in winds of 45 to 50 knots, while the Yellow Pages Endeavour, which held a record of 46.52 knots from 1993 to 2004, was optimized to sail in a 19 knot wind.  Venue has much to do with the windsurfer's success, as all windsurfing 500m records since 1988 have been made at the same canal. Zara Davis holds the outright nautical mile record for a woman.
