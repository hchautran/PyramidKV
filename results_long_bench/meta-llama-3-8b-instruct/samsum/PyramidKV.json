What a country!\r\nDennis: Never been there myself but it's on my itinerary. What's it like?\r\nLaura: A bit tough, truth to tell, but you'd like it. Abject living conditions for local people but we're in a \"touristy\" cocoon, so one easily overlooks the other side. Splendid landscapes, incredible architecture but in a more than sorry state of preservation. I love and hate to be here at the same time.\r\nDennis: So you aren't travelling alone, I presume.\r\nLaura: No, my travelling companion takes me along, so to speak, to his winter quarters, since his health doesn't cope that well with European winters. I couldn't afford these travels entirely on my own of course.\r\nDennis: Always thought Cuba is not expensive. Especially the post-Fidel Cuba.\r\nLaura: Just the contrary. In the good old days when it was supported by the Soviet Union, the living standard was not bad and they didn't have to rely on income from tourism. Then it all went down the drain, even famine and food rationing have become their daily thing. Since early 00s most not rationed goods are available only for CUC, their convertible currency. The bottom line being that whatever you buy as a tourist, you pay +/- western prices.\r\nDennis: So how much do you two spend daily?\r\nLaura: Staying in private houses about at least 100\u20ac, including food, transport and entrance fees. These days we are compelled to stay at a state-run Hotel and pay thru the nose - 130\u20ac a night. No, Cuba is not cheap. But Havana Club YES.\r\nDennis: Don't like the stuff at all.\r\nLaura: Me neither. Gives me headaches. Even one glass of it.\r\nDennis: What you say will make me think twice before setting sail for Cuba.\r\nLaura: But it can be fantastic as well. Eg Vinales Valley in the west, with its horse-riding trips, wild camping and pure nature.\r\nDennis: Sounds better. I'll ask you for details.\r\nDennis: Anyway enjoy your trip as much as you can. Happy trails toyou two!\r\nLaura: Thank you, Dennis.\nSummary: Laura is in Cuba at the moment. She has mixed feelings about Cuba. She's travelling with her companion. Cuba is expensive for tourists. She has to spend over 100\u20ac on a daily basis.\n\n\nDialogue: Kirsten: Youth group this Friday, don't be late.\r\nAlex: What time?\r\nKirsten: 7 pm.

I went there with my mother a few weeks ago and the rates were ok\r\nMart\u00edn: Plus it\u2019s in a hotel, so it\u2019s a little safer\r\nCaleb: Oh sounds good, I\u2019ll try that one.

Any more travelling? Do you still see a lot of your travelling companion (I don\u2019t think you ever mentioned his name). Or are you taking it easy in your rural idyll.\r\nLaura: Hello my dear Dennis! Happy New Year to you too! Am in Cuba at the moment. What a country!\r\nDennis: Never been there myself but it's on my itinerary. What's it like?\r\nLaura: A bit tough, truth to tell, but you'd like it. Abject living conditions for local people but we're in a \"touristy\" cocoon, so one easily overlooks the other side. Splendid landscapes, incredible architecture but in a more than sorry state of preservation. I love and hate to be here at the same time.\r\nDennis: So you aren't travelling alone, I presume.\r\nLaura: No, my travelling companion takes me along, so to speak, to his winter quarters, since his health doesn't cope that well with European winters. I couldn't afford these travels entirely on my own of course.\r\nDennis: Always thought Cuba is not expensive. Especially the post-Fidel Cuba.\r\nLaura: Just the contrary. In the good old days when it was supported by the Soviet Union, the living standard was not bad and they didn't have to rely on income from tourism. Then it all went down the drain, even famine and food rationing have become their daily thing. Since early 00s most not rationed goods are available only for CUC, their convertible currency. The bottom line being that whatever you buy as a tourist, you pay +/- western prices.\r\nDennis: So how much do you two spend daily?\r\nLaura: Staying in private houses about at least 100\u20ac, including food, transport and entrance fees. These days we are compelled to stay at a state-run Hotel and pay thru the nose - 130\u20ac a night. No, Cuba is not cheap. But Havana Club YES.\r\nDennis: Don't like the stuff at all.\r\nLaura: Me neither. Gives me headaches. Even one glass of it.\r\nDennis: What you say will make me think twice before setting sail for Cuba.\r\nLaura: But it can be fantastic as well. Eg Vinales Valley in the west, with its horse-riding trips, wild camping and pure nature.\r\nDennis: Sounds better. I'll ask you for details.\r\nDennis: Anyway enjoy your trip as much as you can. Happy trails toyou two!\r\nLaura: Thank you, Dennis.\nSummary: Laura is in Cuba at the moment. She has mixed feelings about Cuba. She's travelling with her companion. Cuba is expensive for tourists. She has to spend over 100\u20ac on a daily basis.\n", "answers": ["Kirsten reminds Alex that the youth group meets this Friday at 7 pm and go bowling."], "length": 2797, "dataset": "samsum_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "b2b3903cc4020eaef687c516d4a21297b9deb76c22bd7616", "pred": " Kirsten reminds Alex about the youth group meeting on Friday at 7 pm.

{"prompt": "Summarize the dialogue into a few short sentences. The following are some examples.\n\nDialogue: Gloria: Hi Tony, meant to ask you about it for some time now. Will a possible Brexit affect your business?\r\nTony: In Britain the farce of Brexit looms over everything all day every day. It's going to affect us all in a most adverse manner. No doubt about it.\r\nGloria: I'll never understand why so many voted for it.\r\nTony: Nor will I. It is hard to believe that as a nation we have been so stupid as to vote to leave the EU. Utter and sheer short-sightedness.\r\nTony: When the French protest against their government, they do it on the streets with their Gilets Jaunes. We do protest votes against the government. I\u2019m not sure which nation has developed the more stupid way to object to our government!\r\nGloria: But will you in your printing business be affected?\r\nTony: Dunno yet. Actually I've had very few commissions from abroad, so not directly. But we are all going to have less money in our pockets. So there'll be less interest in fancy printed matter.\r\nTony: But that will affect my holiday plans! And I hate that! The whole nonsense of exchanging money leaves me sick. I've always been out of pocket, no matter whether in Austria or France. And now with the pound going down the drain...\r\nGloria: We are hardly meeting any British tourists in Mexico now. One couple in Campeche the other day but they said they're attending a convention or sth.\r\nTony: That's what I mean. We'll be stewing in our own splendidly isolated sauce again.\r\nGloria: Don't worry. You can always visit us in Austria paying your pounds which we will then spend visiting you in England.\r\nTony: That's a good plan. But how about me visiting France or Spain??? Any family or friends there?\r\nGloria: Do you think the second referendum is an option?\r\nTony: Definitely. Those morons voted \"for\" out of ignorance, out of sheer lack of knowledge and understanding. Common awareness of economic and political consequences of Brexit has made a quantum jump in this country as late as in the last few months.\r\nTony: And if you ask me, the Irish border issue cannot be solved thru' any diplomatic channels. It either stays open, the way it is now, or we have a new armed conflict with no prospect of being settled.\r\nGloria: Hasn't it started yet?\r\nTony: Yes. I fear the worst.\r\nGloria: Oh Tony... So wretched....\nSummary: Tony's business will be affected by Brexit and both her and Gloria will never understand why people voted for it. It will also affect Tony's holiday plans.

Will a possible Brexit affect your business?\r\nTony: In Britain the farce of Brexit looms over everything all day every day. It's going to affect us all in a most adverse manner. No doubt about it.\r\nGloria: I'll never understand why so many voted for it.\r\nTony: Nor will I. It is hard to believe that as a nation we have been so stupid as to vote to leave the EU. Utter and sheer short-sightedness.\r\nTony: When the French protest against their government, they do it on the streets with their Gilets Jaunes. We do protest votes against the government. I\u2019m not sure which nation has developed the more stupid way to object to our government!\r\nGloria: But will you in your printing business be affected?\r\nTony: Dunno yet. Actually I've had very few commissions from abroad, so not directly. But we are all going to have less money in our pockets. So there'll be less interest in fancy printed matter.\r\nTony: But that will affect my holiday plans! And I hate that! The whole nonsense of exchanging money leaves me sick. I've always been out of pocket, no matter whether in Austria or France. And now with the pound going down the drain...\r\nGloria: We are hardly meeting any British tourists in Mexico now. One couple in Campeche the other day but they said they're attending a convention or sth.\r\nTony: That's what I mean. We'll be stewing in our own splendidly isolated sauce again.\r\nGloria: Don't worry. You can always visit us in Austria paying your pounds which we will then spend visiting you in England.\r\nTony: That's a good plan. But how about me visiting France or Spain??? Any family or friends there?\r\nGloria: Do you think the second referendum is an option?\r\nTony: Definitely. Those morons voted \"for\" out of ignorance, out of sheer lack of knowledge and understanding. Common awareness of economic and political consequences of Brexit has made a quantum jump in this country as late as in the last few months.\r\nTony: And if you ask me, the Irish border issue cannot be solved thru' any diplomatic channels. It either stays open, the way it is now, or we have a new armed conflict with no prospect of being settled.\r\nGloria: Hasn't it started yet?\r\nTony: Yes. I fear the worst.\r\nGloria: Oh Tony... So wretched....\nSummary: Tony's business will be affected by Brexit and both her and Gloria will never understand why people voted for it. It will also affect Tony's holiday plans.

He said you can do 80% of the work with 20% of the time, and I suppose the government must be trying to prove him right, because now that's all the time we've got left. \r\nGeorge:  Problem is, I don't think we did the other 20% of the work with the first 80% of the time. \r\nPeter: Don't even talk about it.\r\nGeorge: The issue is that May is useless and all the people in government have either no solutions or no ability to take command, and the EU negoiators intentionally sabotaged the process.\r\nPeter: The simplest thing to do now would be to simply withdraw Article 50, stay in and make as much trouble for Merkel and Macron as we possibly can so that they wish they had let us go when they had the chance.\r\nPeter: But let's leave the topic. I'd rather talk about just about anything else. \nSummary: George asks Peter about Brexit. Peter is upset about this topic. In his opinion the politicians don't work effectively. For Peter the simplest thing to do would be to withdraw Article 50, stay in and make much trouble for Merkel and Macron.

We will do that but not more than once a week or so.\r\nDieter: Don't bother then texting us.

I wanted to ask my GP, but judging on her general approach...\r\nMary: I highly recommend chlorella (pills), vitamin B12 and D3. Basically everything that has proteins and helps you absorb them.\r\nAnna: Thank you so much!\r\nAnna: It really feels like a new journey, so excited! :)\r\nMary: You need to come over so I can show you some recipes! And remember - if you have any doubts, problems, you can always ask me, I'll do my best to help :)\nSummary: Anna has been a vegetarian for a month.

I'll get you a small basketful of cooking apples and a bigger one with different sorts of dessert apples. So happy they'll be put to good use:)\r\nSoph: That sounds a lot! Thank you. I can always share them with my neighbor.\r\nSamantha: I really don't know what to do with them all! We're eating them with everything really and I've made some apple puree and some apple chutney.

And in exchange they received an adequate amount of juice.\r\nSamantha: So it wasn't juice from their own apples?\r\nSoph: As I understood it, no. But doesn't matter since it was an organic grower. And I think a friend of theirs or something, they must know each other well, since he accepted their apples and they didn't have any official certificate or anything.\r\nSamantha: That's an idea. Have you got their phone number? Or maybe could you ask them about that organic juice producer? You know Oli better than I.\r\nSoph: I'm sure he'd be glad to hear from you!

It's alright, I still have more than enough of them :)\r\nSoph: Very well then. And thanks for the apples.\r\nSoph: And the delivery :))\r\nSamantha: Pleasure.\nSummary: Samantha has grown a lot of apples. She will bring two baskets of them to Soph.

Maybe some people can't come and they're already selling their tickets\nDaniel: It's risky as well, but I think it's better than some dodgy website. On Facebook you at least have the name of the person who's selling\nPatricia: It's also good when you can buy a ticket from someone who's from the same city - you can just meet and exchange\nLucas: Yeah, so someone won't wander off with your money!\nVictoria: Why it has to be so difficult? :(((\nVictoria: I'll try it out guys, thanks!\nLucas: Next time you can set a reminder\nVictoria: Oh, where?\nLucas: Every webpage has a reminder option.

This time I totally missed it, I was away, but I would never have thought that they'll be gone within an hour\nPatricia: An hour?! Wow, that's quick!\nPatricia: When I was buying tickets for Ed Sheeran I was refreshing the page 30 minute before it started\nDaniel: It is a pain, but I think it's a trend now - you buy tickets a year before the event, otherwise you're stuck with dodgy solutions\nVictoria: I'll let you know if I find some tickets, already posted in Facebook that I'm looking for two, at least one :)\nLucas: Good luck! Be careful though ;)\nSummary: Victoria is looking for tickets for Mumford and Sons' concert. They're officially sold out so she's browsing some dubious websites like Viagogo.

Can't you send me a text about whatever is going on?\r\nMark: It's... about money... Something doesn't add up. Okay, I'll wait, if you find 5 minutes in the evening that would be great - it's not that important.\r\nMark: But seriously, don't worry about it ;)\r\nCynthia: I don't think I ever gave you money back for the pasta...

I also found some on Viagogo, have you heard about it?\nDaniel: Huh, I did. I had the same problem with Guns'n'Roses concert last year, there were only some tickets left on Viagogo and I bought two - it was a scam as well\nLucas: They have legit tickets sometimes, some of my friends used it before, but it's nothing sure. It didn't work for me\nPatricia: Yeah, I had a problem with Viagogo as well. I don't know how it works really, but I got scammed as well. Buying tickets from people on Facebook worked better for me\nVictoria: But how can I find them? It's really my last resort :(\nPatricia: Find the official event of the concert and ask around. Maybe some people can't come and they're already selling their tickets\nDaniel: It's risky as well, but I think it's better than some dodgy website. On Facebook you at least have the name of the person who's selling\nPatricia: It's also good when you can buy a ticket from someone who's from the same city - you can just meet and exchange\nLucas: Yeah, so someone won't wander off with your money!\nVictoria: Why it has to be so difficult? :(((\nVictoria: I'll try it out guys, thanks!\nLucas: Next time you can set a reminder\nVictoria: Oh, where?\nLucas: Every webpage has a reminder option. You give them your email address so they can contact you to let you know that the tickets are on sale\nVictoria: Thanks! This time I totally missed it, I was away, but I would never have thought that they'll be gone within an hour\nPatricia: An hour?! Wow, that's quick!\nPatricia: When I was buying tickets for Ed Sheeran I was refreshing the page 30 minute before it started\nDaniel: It is a pain, but I think it's a trend now - you buy tickets a year before the event, otherwise you're stuck with dodgy solutions\nVictoria: I'll let you know if I find some tickets, already posted in Facebook that I'm looking for two, at least one :)\nLucas: Good luck! Be careful though ;)\nSummary: Victoria is looking for tickets for Mumford and Sons' concert. They're officially sold out so she's browsing some dubious websites like Viagogo. Patricia, Lucas and Daniel warn her against doing it and they suggest looking for the tickets on Facebook. \nDialogue: Mark: Hey, sorry to be disturbing you. I know you're probably busy with classes, but can you call me when you finish? I have something important to tell you...\r\nCynthia: You know what, I probably can't make it today - I end pretty late. Can't you send me a text about whatever is going on?\r\nMark: It's... about money... Something doesn't add up. Okay, I'll wait, if you find 5 minutes in the evening that would be great - it's not that important.\r\nMark: But seriously, don't worry about it ;)\r\nCynthia: I don't think I ever gave you money back for the pasta... How much do I owe you?\r\nMark: Nooo, it's not about the pasta, something different - just call in the evening and I'll explain everything calmly and you really have nothing to worry about\r\nCynthia: Yeah, but you also covered my stay...

We need some fresh blood. \r\nBo: yeah, they're definitely interested and I'm pretty sure they have no problem traveling across the country for larps. \r\nSteve: great to hear\r\nBo: yeah, anyway there was also a group of orcs - I think they all new each other beforehand - and they were getting shit-faced every night, making lewd comments to girls and generally being assholes to everyone. \r\nSteve: shit, did you tell the organizers? \r\nBo: yeah, I did, quite a few times, and they supposedly talked to them, but it didn't help at all \r\nSteve: too bad\r\nBo: if it was my larp I'll just kick them out and ban them from other events right after the first night of this shit\r\nSteve: totally\r\nBo: And that was another thing I have a problem with - the organizers just weren't assertive enough with them.
