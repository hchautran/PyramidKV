{"prompt": "Answer the question based on the given passage. Only give me the answer and do not output any other words. The following are some examples.\n\nPassage:\nBilly Cotton\nWilliam Edward \"Billy\" Cotton (6 May 1899 \u2013 25 March 1969) was an English band leader and entertainer, one of the few whose orchestras survived the British dance band era. Cotton is now mainly remembered as a 1950s and 1960s radio and television personality, but his musical career had begun in the 1920s. In his younger years Billy Cotton was also an amateur footballer for Brentford F.C. (and later, for the then Athenian league club Wimbledon F.C.), an accomplished racing driver and the owner of a Gipsy Moth, which he piloted himself. His autobiography, \"I Did It My Way\", was published in 1970, a year after his death.\n\nLife and career\n\nBorn in Smith Square, London, to Joseph and Susan Cotton, Cotton was a choirboy and started his musical career as a drummer. He enlisted in the Royal Fusiliers by falsifying his age and saw service in World War I in Malta and Egypt, before landing at Gallipoli in the middle of an artillery barrage. He was recommended for a commission and learned to fly Bristol Fighter aircraft. He flew solo for the first time in 1918, on the day the Royal Flying Corps became the Royal Air Force. He was not yet 19 years old. In the early 1920s, he worked at several jobs, including as a bus driver, before setting up his own orchestra, the London Savannah Band, in 1924.\n\nAt first a conventional dance band, the London Savannah Band gradually tended towards music hall/vaudeville entertainment, introducing visual and verbal humour in between songs. Famous musicians who played in Billy Cotton's band during the 1920s and 1930s included Arthur Rosebery, Syd Lipton and Nat Gonella. The band was also noted for their African American trombonist and tap dancer, Ellis Jackson. Their signature tune was \"Somebody Stole My Gal\", and they made numerous commercial recordings for Decca.\n\nDuring the Second World War Cotton and his band toured France with the Entertainments National Service Association (ENSA). After the war, he started his successful Sunday lunchtime radio show on BBC, the Billy Cotton Band Show, which ran from 1949 to 1968. In the 1950s, composer Lionel Bart contributed comedy songs to the show.  It regularly opened with the band's signature tune and Cotton's call of \"Wakey Wakey\". From 1957, it was also broadcast on BBC television. Cotton often also provided vocals on many of his bands recordings and was also a vocalist on recordings that didn't feature his band.\n\nAs a racing driver, his finest moment came in 1949 when he finished fourth in the 1949 British Grand Prix, sharing an ERA with David Hampshire.\n\nCotton married Mabel E. Gregory in 1921. They had two sons, Ted and Sir Bill Cotton, who later became the BBC's managing director of television. In 1962 Billy Cotton suffered a stroke. He died in 1969 while watching a boxing match at Wembley.\n\nBilly Cotton was the great-great-uncle of TV & Radio Presenter Fearne Cotton.\n\nSelected filmography\n\n* The First Mrs. Fraser (1932)\n* Variety (1935)\n\nBibliography\n\n* I Did It My Way, Autobiography, 1970, Publisher: George G.

It is part of the region of Attica. The regional unit covers the Saronic Islands, a small part of the Peloponnese peninsula, and a few islands off the eastern Peloponnese coast. \n\nAdministration\n\nAs a part of the 2011 Kallikratis government reform, the regional unit Islands was created out of part of the former Piraeus Prefecture. It is subdivided into 8 municipalities. These are (number as in the map in the infobox):\n\n*Aegina (Aigina, 3)\n*Agistri (Agkistri, 2)\n*Cythera (Kythira, 6)\n*Hydra (Ydra, 13)\n*Poros (9)\n*Salamis (Salamina, 10)\n*Spetses (11)\n*Troizinia-Methana (12)\nQuestion:\nWhich country occupies the islands called Euboea, Kefalonia, Khos, Zakynthos, Thassos, Lefkada, Karpathos and Kythira?\nAnswer:\nYunanistan\nPassage:\nBallasalla\nBallasalla ()  is a village in the parish of Malew in the south-east of the Isle of Man, close to the airport and the town of Castletown. The village was built mostly from the ruins of the nearby Rushen Abbey, a Cistercian abbey founded in the 12th century and dissolved in the 16th century.\n\nGovernance\n\nThe lowest-level local authority is Malew Parish Commissioners who are based in Ballasalla.\n There are currently five commissioners. The day-to-day activities of the authority are run by the clerk, Mr Barry Powell.\n The commissioners' offices are located on the main road of the village close to the Whitestone Inn.\n\nResidents' association\n\nThe village has an active residents' association, Ballasalla and District Residents Association (BADRA).\n\nSince 2010 the village has had a very popular Community Partnership set up with the involvement of the Isle of Man Government, outside agencies and local residents, with Graham Cregeen, MHK for Malew and Santon, as Chairman. \n\nEconomy\n\nThe HQ of Citywing, the Isle of Man airline, is at Hangar 9 at Isle of Man Airport near Ballasalla.  The former Manx Airlines also had its head office at the Airport.  At Balthane on the eastern edge of the village is an industrial estate with local businesses including Athol Garage, sellers of motor vehicles, and Pooil Vaaish, dealing in slate, marble and monumental masonry.\n\nEducation\n\nThe village has its own primary school, Ballasalla School. \n\nSport\n\nMalew football club play their home games at the Malew Football Ground, Clagh Vane and Ronaldsway play their home games at the Ronaldsway Aircraft Factory Fields. Both clubs compete in the Isle of Man Football League.\n\nTransport\n\nThere are 3 buses an hour to Onchan, Douglas, Castletown, Port St Mary and Port Erin operated by the nationalised Bus Vannin. There are also infrequent buses to Peel and Foxdale. Ballasalla railway station on the Isle of Man Railway is at the eastern side of the village and the railway operates between March and November. The station used to have its own cattle dock and goods sidings, seeing intensive use in the early to middle 20th century, although these were lost to office developments in 1985 when the station building was relocated. The A5 Douglas to Port Erin road runs through the village and this is the main route to the south of the island. The Isle of Man Airport is at Ronaldsway just south of the village and also has a small request stop on the railway, a short distance from the terminal. Arriving air passengers sometimes catch trains for the novelty value of travelling by steam train.\n\nReligion\n\nSt Mark's Church is in St Mark's Road, some distance from the village. The foundation stone was laid in 1771 and it was consecrated in 1772 by the then Bishop of Sodor and Man, Mark Hildesley. It was intended to serve as a chapel of ease and a parish school more conveniently located for those from the outlying hill district than Kirk Malew Church. There was an ancient church near the site which is said to have been dedicated to St Mark.  \n\nSt Mary the Virgin, Abbey Church was built from local limestone sourced from Scarlett Point south of Castletown, with the foundation stone being laid in 1895 by Lady Ridgeway, the wife of the then Lieutenant Governor of the Isle of Man, Sir Joseph West Ridgeway. The church was consecrated in 1896 and remains in regular use today, with its own substantial church hall within its grounds.\n Both churches are Church of England in the Diocese of Sodor and Man.\n\nBallasalla has had three Methodist chapels in the past. The original Ballafesson Wesleyan Methodist Chapel dates from about 1798. It was restructured in 1846, although the original roof slate is still intact.  It is now a scout hall. Ballasalla (Bridge Road) Primitive Methodist Chapel was built in 1833. It closed as a chapel in 1949, but continued to be used as a Sunday school until 1975. It was sold in 1980 and the seats, pulpit and choir pews were moved to Ballafesson Wesleyan Methodist Chapel. A second Wesleyan Methodist chapel was built in the village in 1893. It closed in 1980 and was demolished in 1981 as the building was unsafe. \n\nAmenities and events\n\nBallasalla is the site of the mediaeval Monks' Bridge over the Silver Burn which leads to the Manx National Heritage site of Rushen Abbey; this forms part of the Story Of Mann set of attractions established in 1989 and now part of an island-wide series of attractions. The abbey was extensively redeveloped as a heritage site in 1996, having latterly been home to The Academy, one of very few nightclubs outside of Douglas.\n\nAlso near the village is the Silverdale Glen, set amongst woodland, with a small boating lake, caf\u00e9 and sprawling playing fields and playground including a water-powered carousel. A wooded footpath alongside the Silverburn river runs between Rushen Abbey, the Monks' Bridge, and Silverdale Glen. In a small hamlet above the village the eponymous St Mark's Fair is held annually on the third Saturday in July.\n The Millennium Way long distance footpath, opened in 1979, which begins at Castle Rushen and heads north towards Ramsey, runs through the village alongside the banks of the river, leading to Poulsom Park in Castletown to the south, and to St. Mark's above the village to the north. \n\nThe village has a pub and various shops. The local authority Malew Parish Commissioners office is next to the pub and a modern office development, Portland Court, occupies former railway goods yard. This was sold off in 1985 for redevelopment and the new station lies on the opposite side of the tracks.\nQuestion:\nBallasalla and Colby are railway stations on which British island?\nAnswer:\nMan Island\nPassage:\nArnolfini\nThe Arnolfini is an international arts centre and gallery in Bristol, England. It has a programme of contemporary art exhibitions, artist's performance, music and dance events, poetry and book readings, talks, lectures and cinema. There is also a specialist art bookshop and a caf\u00e9 bar. Educational activities are undertaken and experimental digital media work supported by online resources. A number of festivals are regularly hosted by the gallery. Arnolfini is funded by Bristol City Council and Arts Council England, with some corporate and individual supporters.\n\nThe gallery was founded in 1961 by Jeremy Rees, and was originally located in Clifton. In the 1970s it moved to Queen Square, before moving to its present location, Bush House on Bristol's waterfront, in 1975. The name of the gallery is taken from Jan van Eyck's 15th-century painting, The Arnolfini Portrait. Arnolfini has since been refurbished and redeveloped in 1989 and 2005. Artists whose work has been exhibited include Bridget Riley, Rachel Whiteread, Richard Long and Jack Yeats. Performers have included Goat Island Performance Group, the Philip Glass Ensemble, and Shobana Jeyasingh Dance Company. The gallery reached a new audience in April 2010, when it was chosen to host one of the three 2010 general election debates.\n\nHistory\n\nJeremy Rees started Arnolfini with the assistance of his wife Annabel, and the painter John Orsborn in 1961. The original location was above a bookshop in the Triangle in Clifton, Bristol. In 1968, Rees was able to give up his teaching job and with the aid of private funding and Arts Council funding relocated the gallery to Queen Square, then to E Shed, the current home of the Watershed Media Centre. In 1975, Arnolfini moved to its present home in Bush House, occupying two floors of a 19th-century Grade II* listed tea warehouse situated on the side of the Floating Harbour in Bristol city centre. The remainder of the building was office space leased out by developers JT Group.   \n\nThe architect of Bush House was Richard Shackleton Pope, who constructed first the south part of the warehouse (1831) then extended it to the north in 1835\u20131836. Its original use was as a warehouse for local iron foundry D., E. & A. Acraman. The building has a Pennant Sandstone exterior with arched ground level entrances and arched windows above. This style of architecture is the first example of the Bristol Byzantine style which became popular in the 1850s. Later conversion to a tea warehouse added interstital floors. \n\nOriginally dedicated to exhibiting the work of artists from the West of England, under the directorship of Barry Barker (1986\u20131991) the gallery moved towards a more general spread of contemporary art. Barker supervised a successful refurbishment of the gallery spaces and caf\u00e9 bar by David Chipperfield. Before development work began, the Arnolfini was attracting over 285,000 visitors per year. Subsequent Directors have been Tessa Jackson (1991\u20131999),  Caroline Collier (1999\u20132005)  and Tom Trevor (2005-2013).\n\nAs part of a two-year development project that finished in September 2005,  \nthe old warehouse has been fully redeveloped, adding another attic storey. Arnolfini now occupies the lower three floors and basement, and the upper floors are leased to help pay for the running costs.  One tenant is the School of Creative Arts, part of the University of the West of England. Funding for this development was received from the National Lottery and the Barker-Mill Trust, set up by long term Arnolfini patron Peter Barker-Mill.   The original committee to support Arnolfini included Peter Barker-Mill, Ann Hewer, and Lawrence Ogilvie. \n\nName\n\nThe Arnolfini is named after Jan van Eyck's masterpiece The Arnolfini Portrait (1434) depicting the merchant and arts patron Giovanni Arnolfini. The Arnolfini Portrait is one of the earliest paintings to assert the presence of the artist within its depiction (an inscription in the middle of the work and a reflection in a mirror on the back wall) and one of Arnolfini's consistent concerns: to explore the role of artist as a witness and recorder of what is around them \u2013 contemporary society. The painting is in the National Gallery, London and it was one of the founder's favourite paintings.\n\nToday\n\nArnolfini has three floors of galleries, a specialist arts bookshop, a cinema which can also be used as a performance space for theatre, live art, dance and music, a specialist arts bookshop, a reading room that provides reference material for all past exhibitions and wide range of books and catalogues, and a caf\u00e9 bar. Entrance to the galleries is free of charge. Notable exhibitions have included works by Bridget Riley, Richard Long, Rachel Whiteread, Paul McCartney, Angus Fairhurst and Louise Bourgeois.  Regular events include poetry and film festivals, live art and dance performances, lectures and jazz and experimental music concerts, including Bodies in Flight, Goat Island Performance Group, Akram Khan, the London Sinfonietta, the Philip Glass Ensemble, Random Dance, and Shobana Jeyasingh Dance Company.\n\nThere is an active access and education programme, hosting visits from students, workshops with artists, presenting interpretative information and offering some work experience placements within the gallery. project.ARNOLFINI is an online experimental web site with dumps of digital media related to Arnolfini exhibitions and events, past and present, which may be reorganised by any online user, utilising resources on the web site to create new works and projects under a copyleft license. \n \nArnolfini also hosts events from outside organisations, including the Encounters Short Film Festival (along with the Watershed Media Centre),  Mayfest, the first Festival of British Independent Cinema,  the biennial  Time Festival of Live Art and Intrigue  and the Bristol Artists Book Events.  In April 2010, British Sky Broadcasting chose Arnolfini to host the second of the three 2010 general election debates.\n\nArnolfini receives funding from Arts Council England,  and Bristol City Council.  According to returns lodged with the Charity Commission for the year ending in March 2009, Arnolfini had 398,000 visitors in 2008/2009. Income was \u00a32.08 million and expenditure was \u00a32.4 million  and the gallery employed 44 people.\nQuestion:\nThe Arnolfini Centre for Contemporary Arts is in which British city?\nAnswer:\nBristol (England)\nPassage:\nHeadlands and bays\nHeadlands and bays are two related features of coastal environments. Headlands and bays are often found on the same coastline. A bay is a body of water, either seawater (salt water) or fresh water, surrounded by land on three sides, whereas a headland is land surrounded by water on three sides. Headlands are characterized by high, breaking waves, rocky shores, intense erosion, and steep sea cliffs. Bays generally have less wave activity, and often less wind activity than the areas of water outside the bay, and typically have sandy beaches. Headlands and bays form on discordant coastlines, where the land consists of bands of rock of alternating resistance that run perpendicular to the coast. \n\nGeology and geography \n\nBays form where weak, or less resistant rocks, such as sands and clays, are eroded, leaving bands of stronger, or more resistant rocks, such as chalk, limestone, and granite), which form a headland or peninsula. Refraction of waves occurs on headlands concentrating wave energy on them, so many other landforms, such as caves, natural arches, and stacks, form on headlands. Wave energy is directed at right angles to the wave crest, and lines drawn at right angles to the wave crest (orthogonals) represent the direction of energy expenditure. Orthogonals converge on headlands and diverge in bays, which concentrates wave energy on the headlands and dissipates wave energy in the bays.  \n\nIn the formation of sea cliffs, wave erosion undercuts the slopes at the shoreline, which retreat landward. This increases the shear stress in the cliff-forming material and accelerates mass movement. The debris from these landslides collects at the base of the cliff and is also removed by the waves, usually during storms, when wave energy is greatest. This debris provides sediment, which is transported through longshore current for the nearby bay. Joints in the headlands are eroded back to form caves, which erode further to form arches. These gaps eventually collapse and leave tall stacks at the ends of the headlands. Eventually these too are eroded by the waves.  \n\nWave refraction disperses wave energy through the bay, and along with the sheltering effect of the headlands this protects bays from storms. This effect means that the waves reaching the shore in a bay are weaker than the waves reaching the headland, and the bay is thus a safer place for water activities like surfing or swimming. Through the deposition of sediment within the bay and the erosion of the headlands, coastlines eventually straighten out. But then the same process starts all over again.\n\nBeach stability \n\nBeaches are dynamic geologic features that can fluctuate between advancement and retreat of sediment.  The natural agents of fluctuation include waves, tides, currents, and winds. Man-made elements such as the interruption of sediment supply, such as a dam, and withdrawal of fluid can also affect beach stabilization.   A headland bay beach can be classified as being in three different states of sedimentation.  Static equilibrium refers to a beach that is stable and does not experience littoral drift or sediment deposition or erosion.   Waves generally diffract around the headland(s) and near the beach when the beach is in a state of static equilibrium.  Dynamic equilibrium occurs when the beach sediments are deposited and eroded at approximately equal rates.  Beaches that have dynamic equilibrium are usually near a river that supplies sediment and would otherwise erode away without the river supply.  Unstable beaches are usually a result of human interaction, such as a breakwater or dammed river.  Unstable beaches are reshaped by continual erosion or deposition and will continue to erode or deposit until a state of equilibrium is reached in the bay.\n\nNotes\nQuestion:\nWhat do you call a piece of land that is surrounded on three sides by water?\nAnswer:\nPenninsula\n\n\nPassage:\nCostermonger\nCostermonger, coster, or costard is a street seller of fruit and vegetables, in London and other British towns. Costermongers were ubiquitous in mid-Victorian England, and some are still found in markets. As usual with street-sellers, they would use a loud sing-song cry or chant to attract attention. The costermonger's cart might be stationary at a market stall, or mobile (horse-drawn or wheelbarrow).  The term is derived from the words costard (a now extinct medieval variety of large, ribbed apple) and monger (seller).\n\nCosters met a need for rapid food distribution from the central markets (e.g., Smithfield for meat, Spitalfields for fruit and vegetables or Billingsgate for fish). Their membership as a coster was signalled by their large neckerchief, known as a kingsman, tied round their necks. Their hostility towards the police was legendary. \n\nThe term is now often used to describe hawkers in general;  sometimes a distinction is made between the two: a costermonger sells from a handcart or animal-drawn cart, while a hawker carries his wares in a basket.\n\nHistory\n\nCostermongers have existed in London since at least the 16th century, when they were mentioned by Shakespeare and Marlowe. They probably were most numerous during the Victorian era, when there were said to be over 30,000 in 1860. They gained a fairly unsavoury reputation for their \"low habits, general improvidence, love of gambling, total want of education, disregard for lawful marriage ceremonies, and their use of a peculiar slang language\" (John Camden Hotten, The Slang Dictionary, 1859). Costers were notoriously competitive: respected \"elder statespeople\" in the costermonger community were elected as pearly kings and queens to keep the peace between rival costermongers. \n\nHowever, crimes such as theft were actually rare among costermongers themselves, especially in an open market where they tended to look out for one another. Even common thieves preferred to prey on shop owners rather than costers, who were inclined to dispense street justice. The costers' animosity towards the police was extreme:\n\nThe activities and lifestyles of 19th century costermongers are comprehensively documented in London Labour and the London Poor, a four volume collection of erudite and well-researched articles by Henry Mayhew. Mayhew describes a Saturday night in the New Cut, a street in Lambeth, south of the river: \n\nSuch was London in the 1840s; but by the end of the 19th century, the costermongers were in gradual decline. They did not disappear as mobile street-sellers until about 1960, when the few that remained took pitches in local markets. They were portrayed in the music halls by vocal comedians such as Albert Chevalier, Bessie Bellwood and Gus Elen. In The Forsyte Saga, Swithin Forsyte is driving Irene Forsyte in his carriage through the streets of London in 1886 and a costermonger (the \"ruffian\") and his girlfriend are riding alongside in their donkey cart, which is overturned in traffic. The anti-hero of Look Back in Anger (1956) by playwright John Osborne is a coster who sells sweets from a stall. The film version depicts aspects of the everyday culture of street markets, such as racial prejudice, irate customers and abusive regulatory officials.\n\nCoster style\n\nBetty May spoke of the \"coster\" style and atmosphere in London around 1900 in her autobiography Tiger Woman: My Story in 1929: \"I am often caught with a sudden longing regret for the streets of Limehouse as I knew them, for the girls with their gaudy shawls and heads of ostrich feathers, like clouds in a wind, and the men in their caps, silk neckerchiefs and bright yellow pointed boots in which they took such pride.

The band was also noted for their African American trombonist and tap dancer, Ellis Jackson. Their signature tune was \"Somebody Stole My Gal\", and they made numerous commercial recordings for Decca.\n\nDuring the Second World War Cotton and his band toured France with the Entertainments National Service Association (ENSA). After the war, he started his successful Sunday lunchtime radio show on BBC, the Billy Cotton Band Show, which ran from 1949 to 1968. In the 1950s, composer Lionel Bart contributed comedy songs to the show.  It regularly opened with the band's signature tune and Cotton's call of \"Wakey Wakey\".

The regional unit covers the Saronic Islands, a small part of the Peloponnese peninsula, and a few islands off the eastern Peloponnese coast. \n\nAdministration\n\nAs a part of the 2011 Kallikratis government reform, the regional unit Islands was created out of part of the former Piraeus Prefecture. It is subdivided into 8 municipalities. These are (number as in the map in the infobox):\n\n*Aegina (Aigina, 3)\n*Agistri (Agkistri, 2)\n*Cythera (Kythira, 6)\n*Hydra (Ydra, 13)\n*Poros (9)\n*Salamis (Salamina, 10)\n*Spetses (11)\n*Troizinia-Methana (12)\nQuestion:\nWhich country occupies the islands called Euboea, Kefalonia, Khos, Zakynthos, Thassos, Lefkada, Karpathos and Kythira?\nAnswer:\nYunanistan\nPassage:\nBallasalla\nBallasalla ()  is a village in the parish of Malew in the south-east of the Isle of Man, close to the airport and the town of Castletown. The village was built mostly from the ruins of the nearby Rushen Abbey, a Cistercian abbey founded in the 12th century and dissolved in the 16th century.\n\nGovernance\n\nThe lowest-level local authority is Malew Parish Commissioners who are based in Ballasalla.\n There are currently five commissioners. The day-to-day activities of the authority are run by the clerk, Mr Barry Powell.\n The commissioners' offices are located on the main road of the village close to the Whitestone Inn.\n\nResidents' association\n\nThe village has an active residents' association, Ballasalla and District Residents Association (BADRA).\n\nSince 2010 the village has had a very popular Community Partnership set up with the involvement of the Isle of Man Government, outside agencies and local residents, with Graham Cregeen, MHK for Malew and Santon, as Chairman. \n\nEconomy\n\nThe HQ of Citywing, the Isle of Man airline, is at Hangar 9 at Isle of Man Airport near Ballasalla.  The former Manx Airlines also had its head office at the Airport.  At Balthane on the eastern edge of the village is an industrial estate with local businesses including Athol Garage, sellers of motor vehicles, and Pooil Vaaish, dealing in slate, marble and monumental masonry.\n\nEducation\n\nThe village has its own primary school, Ballasalla School. \n\nSport\n\nMalew football club play their home games at the Malew Football Ground, Clagh Vane and Ronaldsway play their home games at the Ronaldsway Aircraft Factory Fields. Both clubs compete in the Isle of Man Football League.\n\nTransport\n\nThere are 3 buses an hour to Onchan, Douglas, Castletown, Port St Mary and Port Erin operated by the nationalised Bus Vannin. There are also infrequent buses to Peel and Foxdale. Ballasalla railway station on the Isle of Man Railway is at the eastern side of the village and the railway operates between March and November. The station used to have its own cattle dock and goods sidings, seeing intensive use in the early to middle 20th century, although these were lost to office developments in 1985 when the station building was relocated. The A5 Douglas to Port Erin road runs through the village and this is the main route to the south of the island. The Isle of Man Airport is at Ronaldsway just south of the village and also has a small request stop on the railway, a short distance from the terminal. Arriving air passengers sometimes catch trains for the novelty value of travelling by steam train.\n\nReligion\n\nSt Mark's Church is in St Mark's Road, some distance from the village. The foundation stone was laid in 1771 and it was consecrated in 1772 by the then Bishop of Sodor and Man, Mark Hildesley. It was intended to serve as a chapel of ease and a parish school more conveniently located for those from the outlying hill district than Kirk Malew Church. There was an ancient church near the site which is said to have been dedicated to St Mark.  \n\nSt Mary the Virgin, Abbey Church was built from local limestone sourced from Scarlett Point south of Castletown, with the foundation stone being laid in 1895 by Lady Ridgeway, the wife of the then Lieutenant Governor of the Isle of Man, Sir Joseph West Ridgeway. The church was consecrated in 1896 and remains in regular use today, with its own substantial church hall within its grounds.\n Both churches are Church of England in the Diocese of Sodor and Man.\n\nBallasalla has had three Methodist chapels in the past. The original Ballafesson Wesleyan Methodist Chapel dates from about 1798. It was restructured in 1846, although the original roof slate is still intact.  It is now a scout hall. Ballasalla (Bridge Road) Primitive Methodist Chapel was built in 1833. It closed as a chapel in 1949, but continued to be used as a Sunday school until 1975. It was sold in 1980 and the seats, pulpit and choir pews were moved to Ballafesson Wesleyan Methodist Chapel. A second Wesleyan Methodist chapel was built in the village in 1893. It closed in 1980 and was demolished in 1981 as the building was unsafe. \n\nAmenities and events\n\nBallasalla is the site of the mediaeval Monks' Bridge over the Silver Burn which leads to the Manx National Heritage site of Rushen Abbey; this forms part of the Story Of Mann set of attractions established in 1989 and now part of an island-wide series of attractions. The abbey was extensively redeveloped as a heritage site in 1996, having latterly been home to The Academy, one of very few nightclubs outside of Douglas.\n\nAlso near the village is the Silverdale Glen, set amongst woodland, with a small boating lake, caf\u00e9 and sprawling playing fields and playground including a water-powered carousel. A wooded footpath alongside the Silverburn river runs between Rushen Abbey, the Monks' Bridge, and Silverdale Glen. In a small hamlet above the village the eponymous St Mark's Fair is held annually on the third Saturday in July.\n The Millennium Way long distance footpath, opened in 1979, which begins at Castle Rushen and heads north towards Ramsey, runs through the village alongside the banks of the river, leading to Poulsom Park in Castletown to the south, and to St. Mark's above the village to the north. \n\nThe village has a pub and various shops. The local authority Malew Parish Commissioners office is next to the pub and a modern office development, Portland Court, occupies former railway goods yard. This was sold off in 1985 for redevelopment and the new station lies on the opposite side of the tracks.\nQuestion:\nBallasalla and Colby are railway stations on which British island?\nAnswer:\nMan Island\nPassage:\nArnolfini\nThe Arnolfini is an international arts centre and gallery in Bristol, England. It has a programme of contemporary art exhibitions, artist's performance, music and dance events, poetry and book readings, talks, lectures and cinema. There is also a specialist art bookshop and a caf\u00e9 bar. Educational activities are undertaken and experimental digital media work supported by online resources. A number of festivals are regularly hosted by the gallery. Arnolfini is funded by Bristol City Council and Arts Council England, with some corporate and individual supporters.\n\nThe gallery was founded in 1961 by Jeremy Rees, and was originally located in Clifton. In the 1970s it moved to Queen Square, before moving to its present location, Bush House on Bristol's waterfront, in 1975. The name of the gallery is taken from Jan van Eyck's 15th-century painting, The Arnolfini Portrait. Arnolfini has since been refurbished and redeveloped in 1989 and 2005. Artists whose work has been exhibited include Bridget Riley, Rachel Whiteread, Richard Long and Jack Yeats. Performers have included Goat Island Performance Group, the Philip Glass Ensemble, and Shobana Jeyasingh Dance Company. The gallery reached a new audience in April 2010, when it was chosen to host one of the three 2010 general election debates.\n\nHistory\n\nJeremy Rees started Arnolfini with the assistance of his wife Annabel, and the painter John Orsborn in 1961. The original location was above a bookshop in the Triangle in Clifton, Bristol. In 1968, Rees was able to give up his teaching job and with the aid of private funding and Arts Council funding relocated the gallery to Queen Square, then to E Shed, the current home of the Watershed Media Centre. In 1975, Arnolfini moved to its present home in Bush House, occupying two floors of a 19th-century Grade II* listed tea warehouse situated on the side of the Floating Harbour in Bristol city centre. The remainder of the building was office space leased out by developers JT Group.   \n\nThe architect of Bush House was Richard Shackleton Pope, who constructed first the south part of the warehouse (1831) then extended it to the north in 1835\u20131836. Its original use was as a warehouse for local iron foundry D., E. & A. Acraman. The building has a Pennant Sandstone exterior with arched ground level entrances and arched windows above. This style of architecture is the first example of the Bristol Byzantine style which became popular in the 1850s. Later conversion to a tea warehouse added interstital floors. \n\nOriginally dedicated to exhibiting the work of artists from the West of England, under the directorship of Barry Barker (1986\u20131991) the gallery moved towards a more general spread of contemporary art. Barker supervised a successful refurbishment of the gallery spaces and caf\u00e9 bar by David Chipperfield. Before development work began, the Arnolfini was attracting over 285,000 visitors per year. Subsequent Directors have been Tessa Jackson (1991\u20131999),  Caroline Collier (1999\u20132005)  and Tom Trevor (2005-2013).\n\nAs part of a two-year development project that finished in September 2005,  \nthe old warehouse has been fully redeveloped, adding another attic storey. Arnolfini now occupies the lower three floors and basement, and the upper floors are leased to help pay for the running costs.  One tenant is the School of Creative Arts, part of the University of the West of England. Funding for this development was received from the National Lottery and the Barker-Mill Trust, set up by long term Arnolfini patron Peter Barker-Mill.   The original committee to support Arnolfini included Peter Barker-Mill, Ann Hewer, and Lawrence Ogilvie. \n\nName\n\nThe Arnolfini is named after Jan van Eyck's masterpiece The Arnolfini Portrait (1434) depicting the merchant and arts patron Giovanni Arnolfini. The Arnolfini Portrait is one of the earliest paintings to assert the presence of the artist within its depiction (an inscription in the middle of the work and a reflection in a mirror on the back wall) and one of Arnolfini's consistent concerns: to explore the role of artist as a witness and recorder of what is around them \u2013 contemporary society. The painting is in the National Gallery, London and it was one of the founder's favourite paintings.\n\nToday\n\nArnolfini has three floors of galleries, a specialist arts bookshop, a cinema which can also be used as a performance space for theatre, live art, dance and music, a specialist arts bookshop, a reading room that provides reference material for all past exhibitions and wide range of books and catalogues, and a caf\u00e9 bar. Entrance to the galleries is free of charge. Notable exhibitions have included works by Bridget Riley, Richard Long, Rachel Whiteread, Paul McCartney, Angus Fairhurst and Louise Bourgeois.  Regular events include poetry and film festivals, live art and dance performances, lectures and jazz and experimental music concerts, including Bodies in Flight, Goat Island Performance Group, Akram Khan, the London Sinfonietta, the Philip Glass Ensemble, Random Dance, and Shobana Jeyasingh Dance Company.\n\nThere is an active access and education programme, hosting visits from students, workshops with artists, presenting interpretative information and offering some work experience placements within the gallery. project.ARNOLFINI is an online experimental web site with dumps of digital media related to Arnolfini exhibitions and events, past and present, which may be reorganised by any online user, utilising resources on the web site to create new works and projects under a copyleft license. \n \nArnolfini also hosts events from outside organisations, including the Encounters Short Film Festival (along with the Watershed Media Centre),  Mayfest, the first Festival of British Independent Cinema,  the biennial  Time Festival of Live Art and Intrigue  and the Bristol Artists Book Events.  In April 2010, British Sky Broadcasting chose Arnolfini to host the second of the three 2010 general election debates.\n\nArnolfini receives funding from Arts Council England,  and Bristol City Council.  According to returns lodged with the Charity Commission for the year ending in March 2009, Arnolfini had 398,000 visitors in 2008/2009. Income was \u00a32.08 million and expenditure was \u00a32.4 million  and the gallery employed 44 people.\nQuestion:\nThe Arnolfini Centre for Contemporary Arts is in which British city?\nAnswer:\nBristol (England)\nPassage:\nHeadlands and bays\nHeadlands and bays are two related features of coastal environments. Headlands and bays are often found on the same coastline. A bay is a body of water, either seawater (salt water) or fresh water, surrounded by land on three sides, whereas a headland is land surrounded by water on three sides. Headlands are characterized by high, breaking waves, rocky shores, intense erosion, and steep sea cliffs. Bays generally have less wave activity, and often less wind activity than the areas of water outside the bay, and typically have sandy beaches. Headlands and bays form on discordant coastlines, where the land consists of bands of rock of alternating resistance that run perpendicular to the coast. \n\nGeology and geography \n\nBays form where weak, or less resistant rocks, such as sands and clays, are eroded, leaving bands of stronger, or more resistant rocks, such as chalk, limestone, and granite), which form a headland or peninsula. Refraction of waves occurs on headlands concentrating wave energy on them, so many other landforms, such as caves, natural arches, and stacks, form on headlands. Wave energy is directed at right angles to the wave crest, and lines drawn at right angles to the wave crest (orthogonals) represent the direction of energy expenditure. Orthogonals converge on headlands and diverge in bays, which concentrates wave energy on the headlands and dissipates wave energy in the bays.  \n\nIn the formation of sea cliffs, wave erosion undercuts the slopes at the shoreline, which retreat landward. This increases the shear stress in the cliff-forming material and accelerates mass movement. The debris from these landslides collects at the base of the cliff and is also removed by the waves, usually during storms, when wave energy is greatest. This debris provides sediment, which is transported through longshore current for the nearby bay. Joints in the headlands are eroded back to form caves, which erode further to form arches. These gaps eventually collapse and leave tall stacks at the ends of the headlands. Eventually these too are eroded by the waves.  \n\nWave refraction disperses wave energy through the bay, and along with the sheltering effect of the headlands this protects bays from storms. This effect means that the waves reaching the shore in a bay are weaker than the waves reaching the headland, and the bay is thus a safer place for water activities like surfing or swimming. Through the deposition of sediment within the bay and the erosion of the headlands, coastlines eventually straighten out. But then the same process starts all over again.\n\nBeach stability \n\nBeaches are dynamic geologic features that can fluctuate between advancement and retreat of sediment.  The natural agents of fluctuation include waves, tides, currents, and winds. Man-made elements such as the interruption of sediment supply, such as a dam, and withdrawal of fluid can also affect beach stabilization.   A headland bay beach can be classified as being in three different states of sedimentation.  Static equilibrium refers to a beach that is stable and does not experience littoral drift or sediment deposition or erosion.   Waves generally diffract around the headland(s) and near the beach when the beach is in a state of static equilibrium.  Dynamic equilibrium occurs when the beach sediments are deposited and eroded at approximately equal rates.  Beaches that have dynamic equilibrium are usually near a river that supplies sediment and would otherwise erode away without the river supply.  Unstable beaches are usually a result of human interaction, such as a breakwater or dammed river.  Unstable beaches are reshaped by continual erosion or deposition and will continue to erode or deposit until a state of equilibrium is reached in the bay.\n\nNotes\nQuestion:\nWhat do you call a piece of land that is surrounded on three sides by water?\nAnswer:\nPenninsula\n", "answers": ["Fruiting", "Friut", "Fruiting Shrubs", "Prutas", "Bacca", "Nutritious fruits", "Simple fruit", "Culture of fruits", "Fruits", "Fleshy fruit", "Seed pod", "Pod types", "Fruit", "Fruity"], "length": 3953, "dataset": "triviaqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "a6b0e6b9bf53f05d1569572cebd9359a0d4136a026613c7d", "pred": "Fruit and vegetables\nPassage:\nThe Great Fire of London\nThe Great Fire of London was a major conflagration that swept through the central parts of"}
{"prompt": "Answer the question based on the given passage. Only give me the answer and do not output any other words. The following are some examples.\n\nPassage:\nBellini (cocktail)\nA Bellini cocktail is a mixture of Prosecco sparkling wine and peach pur\u00e9e or nectar. This cocktail originated in Venice, Italy.\n\nHistory\n\nThe Bellini was invented sometime between 1934 and 1948    by Giuseppe Cipriani, founder of Harry's Bar in Venice, Italy. He named the drink the Bellini because its unique pink color reminded him of the toga of a saint in a painting by 15th-century Venetian artist Giovanni Bellini. \n\nThe drink started as a seasonal specialty at Harry's Bar, a favorite haunt of Ernest Hemingway, Sinclair Lewis and Orson Welles. Later, it also became popular at the bar's New York counterpart. After an entrepreneurial Frenchman set up a business to ship fresh white peach pur\u00e9e to both locations, it became a year-round favorite.\n\nThe Bellini is an IBA Official Cocktail. They also suggest a Puccini, replacing the peach pur\u00e9e with an equal amount of mandarin juice, a Rossini, which uses strawberry pur\u00e9e, or a Tintoretto, which is made with pomegranate juice.\n\nPreparation and serving\n\nThe Bellini consists of pur\u00e9ed white peaches and Prosecco, an Italian sparkling wine. Marinating fresh peaches in wine is an Italian tradition. The original recipe was made with a bit of raspberry or cherry juice to give the drink a pink glow. Due, in part, to the limited availability of both white peaches and Prosecco, several variations exist.\n\nCalifornia produces a white peach that works well,  and yellow peaches or peach nectar can be substituted, especially if peaches are out of season and the flavor would be very bland. Other fruits or even flavoured liqueurs (peach schnapps, for example) are sometimes substituted for the peach pur\u00e9e.\n\nThe Cipriani family produces Bellini Base  for the signature cocktail of the Harry's Bar restaurants.\n\nOther sparkling wines are commonly used in place of Prosecco, though richly flavored French champagne does not pair well with the light, fruity flavor of the Bellini. For a non-alcoholic version, sparkling juice or seltzer is used in place of the wine.\nQuestion:\nWhich fruit juice is added to champagne to make a Bellini cocktail?\nAnswer:\nPeacherine\nPassage:\nGlobus cruciger\nThe globus cruciger (Latin, \"cross-bearing orb\"), also known as the orb and cross, an orb (Latin globus) topped (Latin gerere, to wear) by a cross (Latin crux), has been a Christian symbol of authority since the Middle Ages, used on coins, in iconography, and with the sceptre as royal regalia. The cross represents Christ's dominion over the orb of the world, literally held in the hand of an earthly ruler (or sometimes it is held by an angel). In the iconography of Western art, when Christ himself holds the globe, he is called Salvator Mundi, the Saviour of the World; his statue is the Infant Jesus of Prague.\n\nHistory\n\nHolding the world in one's hand, or more ominously, under one's foot, has been used as a symbol since antiquity. To citizens of the Roman Empire, the plain round globe held by Jupiter represented the world, or the universe, as the dominion held by the emperor. A 2nd-century coin from the reign of Emperor Hadrian shows the Roman goddess Salus with her foot upon a globus, and a 4th-century coin from the reign of Emperor Constantine I shows her with a globus in hand.  The orbis terrarum was central to the iconography of the Tetrarchy, representing the Tetrarchs' restoration of security to the Roman world. Constantine I claimed to have had a vision of a cross above the sun, with the words \"In this sign, you shall conquer\", at the Battle of Milvian Bridge in 312. His soldiers painted crosses upon their shields, and then defeated their foe, Maxentius.\n\nWith the growth of Christianity in the 5th century, the orb (in Latin scriptures orbis terrarum, the 'world of the lands', hence the word \"orb\") was topped with a cross (hence globus cruciger), symbolising the Christian God's dominion over the world. The emperor held the world in his hand, to show that he ruled it on God's behalf. To non-Christians already familiar with the pagan globe, the surmounting of a cross sent a message about the triumph of Christianity. In medieval iconography, an object's size, relative to that of nearby objects, indicated its relative importance; so the world was small and the one who held it was  large, to emphasize the nature of their relationship. Although the globe symbolized the entire Earth, its use spread among many Christian rulers (some of them not even sovereign) who reigned over small parts of the earth.\n\nThe first known use was probably in the early 5th century, possibly as early as between 395 and 408 on the reverse side of the coins of Emperor Arcadius, but most certainly by 423 on the reverse side of the coins of Emperor Theodosius II.\n\nThe globus cruciger was used by powerful rulers and celestial beings alike; it adorned portrayals of both emperors and kings, as well as archangels. It first appeared on coins in the early 5th century and remained popular throughout the Middle Ages in coins, iconography, and royal regalia. The papacy, holding universal canonical jurisdiction and in the Middle Ages once rivaling the Holy Roman Emperor for the supreme feudal status of liege lord of all other (Catholic) rulers, also maintained the symbol on top of the papal tiara (\"triple crown\"; there is no separate papal orb). The crowned orb was in general use as a finial on western royal crowns, whether actual objects or merely heraldic crowns, all over Europe, for example, in Denmark, Sweden, Belgium, the Netherlands, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Hungary, Romania, Yugoslavia, and Imperial Germany, among others.  It may still be seen in the national arms of the surviving European monarchies.  Even in the modern era in England, the Sovereign's Orb symbolises both the state and Church of England under the protection and domain of the royal crown.\n\nGallery\n\nImage:RV Antoniniano Carinus - transparent background.PNG|A Roman Antoninianus coin showing Carinus holding pilum and globe.\nImage:Barbarossa.jpg|Emperor Frederick I Barbarossa.\nImage:Harris-Tweed 1.jpg|The Harris Tweed Orb\nImage:Goldene-bulle 1c-480x475.jpg|The Golden Bull of 1356 by the Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor.\nImage:Kis Karoly TK.jpg|Charles II of Hungary.\nImage:M\u00e1ria Thur\u00f3czy.jpg|Mary of Hungary.\nImage:Wenzel3.jpg|Wenceslaus III of Bohemia.\nImage:D\u00fcrer karl der grosse.jpg|Charlemagne, by Albrecht D\u00fcrer.\nImage:Albrecht D\u00fcrer 082.jpg|Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor, by Albrecht D\u00fcrer.\nImage:Gerard van Honthorst 006.jpg|Frederick V holding the orb.\nImage:Elizabeth I in coronation robes.jpg|Elizabeth I of England in coronation robes and the orb and scepter\nImage:Wien - Schatzkammer - Orb.png|Austrian globus cruciger, part of the Austrian Crown Jewels\nImage:Russian regalia.jpg|Regalia of Russia.\nImage:Crown, Sword and Globus Cruciger of Hungary2.jpg|Holy Crown, Sword and Globus Cruciger of Hungary.\nImage:IconaDerzhavnaya.jpg|Virgin Mary with an orb on Our Lady Derzhavnaya icon\nFile:Heraldic Globus cruciger.svg|A generic globus cruciger as it may be used in heraldry\nImage:Uppland_vapen.svg|Coat of arms of Uppland\nImage:Coat of arms of Montenegro.svg|Orb and scepter in Montenegrin coat of arms\nQuestion:\nWhich British fabric has an \u2018Orb\u2019 trade mark?\nAnswer:\nHarris Tweed\nPassage:\nBear Grylls - Bio, Facts, Family | Famous Birthdays\nBear Grylls - Bio, Facts, Family | Famous Birthdays\nBear Grylls\nGemini Reality Star#10\nAbout\nEnglish adventurer and star of the reality series Man vs. Wild.

It is broadcast on ITV and hosted by Julia Bradbury.\n\nThe show began airing on 22 July 2013 for a 30-episode run  as a summer replacement for The Chase and finished on 30 August 2013.\n\nFormat\n\nThe show consists of three stages, with the aim primarily being to keep as many hourglasses from draining as possible, each timer containing different amounts of cash. In each episode four contestants compete against each other with the aim of answering as many questions correctly as possible.\n\nMain round\n\nAt the start a question is posed to the player on the far left of the studio, The contestant can choose to Stick or Twist, depending on whether they think they know the answer or not. If they decide to Stick, they will answer the question themselves, however if they decide to Twist, they choose which of the other players will answer the question. Whichever option they choose, the three options to the question will then appear. If a player sticks and answers correctly, they get to light a Twister, but if incorrect, control passes to the next player in the line. If they Twist and the player the question is passed to gets the answer correct, they get to light a Twister, but if incorrect, the player who chose to Twist gets to light a Twister instead. Once the sixth Twister is lit, the player in control gets to 'Take on the Twisters' to bank some money. They face 60 seconds of quick-fire general knowledge questions, with the idea to keep as many of the Twisters in play as possible. Once the time is up, the values of the Twisters remaining in play are revealed and the total amount of money is placed in the contestant's bank. This is repeated 4 times each show.\n\nFinal Twist\n\nThe contestant who has banked the highest amount of cash from the main round goes through to play the \"The Final Twist\" where they can win whatever they have banked in the main game. In this round, all 8 Twisters are in play and the idea is to keep as many of them in play as possible after 60 seconds of quick-fire questions. When the time is up, Julia will offer \u00a3200 (\u00a3250 in later episodes) for each Twister that remains in play, for example if the player has 5 Twisters in play, \u00a31000 (\u00a31250 under the \u00a3250 a Twister rule) will be offered. The contestant's money has been placed behind one of the Twisters by an independent adjudicator. One by one, the Twisters in play are revealed to determine whether the money is there. If it is not there, a red \"X\" will appear on the display, but if the money is there, a gold \"WIN\" will appear.\n\nThe Twisters\n\nThere are eight \"Twisters\" in the show. The colours are red, yellow, blue, orange, green, pink, white and purple, each worth different amounts of cash ranging from \u00a3300 to \u00a31,000. The Twisters containing more cash will drain more quickly. If the values of all eight Twisters are revealed, then their amounts are worth double and will remain doubled for the rest of the game.\nQuestion:\nWho presents the ITV quiz show \u2018Take on the Twisters\u2019?\nAnswer:\nJULIA BRADBURY\nPassage:\nRogue Elephant | Definition of Rogue Elephant by Merriam ...\nRogue Elephant | Definition of Rogue Elephant by Merriam-Webster\nFirst Known Use of rogue elephant\n1835\nSeen and Heard\nWhat made you want to look up rogue elephant?

There are many scleroprotein superfamilies including keratin, collagen, elastin, and fibroin. The roles of such proteins include protection and support, forming connective tissue, tendons, bone matrices, and muscle fiber.\n\nBiomolecular structure\n\nA scleroprotein forms long protein filaments, which are shaped like rods or wires. Scleroproteins are structural proteins or storage proteins that are typically inert and water-insoluble. A scleroprotein occurs as an aggregate due to hydrophobic side chains that protrude from the molecule.\n\nA scleroprotein's peptide sequence often has limited residues with repeats; these can form unusual secondary structures, such as a collagen helix. The structures often feature cross-links between chains (e.g., cys-cys disulfide bonds between keratin chains).\n\nScleroproteins tend not to denature as easily as globular proteins.\n\nMiroshnikov et al. (1998) are among the researchers who have attempted to synthesize fibrous proteins.\nQuestion:\nIn humans, what is the name of the fibrous protein found in the outer layer of the skin and is a major constituent of hair and nails?\nAnswer:\nKeratin\n\n\nPassage:\nGORDON JACKSON, 66; WAS BUTLER IN SERIES 'UPSTAIRS ...\nGORDON JACKSON, 66; WAS BUTLER IN SERIES 'UPSTAIRS, DOWNSTAIRS' - The Boston Globe (Boston, MA) | HighBeam Research\nAPA\nAssociated Press. \"GORDON JACKSON, 66; WAS BUTLER IN SERIES 'UPSTAIRS, DOWNSTAIRS'.\" The Boston Globe (Boston, MA).

This cocktail originated in Venice, Italy.\n\nHistory\n\nThe Bellini was invented sometime between 1934 and 1948    by Giuseppe Cipriani, founder of Harry's Bar in Venice, Italy. He named the drink the Bellini because its unique pink color reminded him of the toga of a saint in a painting by 15th-century Venetian artist Giovanni Bellini. \n\nThe drink started as a seasonal specialty at Harry's Bar, a favorite haunt of Ernest Hemingway, Sinclair Lewis and Orson Welles. Later, it also became popular at the bar's New York counterpart. After an entrepreneurial Frenchman set up a business to ship fresh white peach pur\u00e9e to both locations, it became a year-round favorite.\n\nThe Bellini is an IBA Official Cocktail. They also suggest a Puccini, replacing the peach pur\u00e9e with an equal amount of mandarin juice, a Rossini, which uses strawberry pur\u00e9e, or a Tintoretto, which is made with pomegranate juice.\n\nPreparation and serving\n\nThe Bellini consists of pur\u00e9ed white peaches and Prosecco, an Italian sparkling wine. Marinating fresh peaches in wine is an Italian tradition. The original recipe was made with a bit of raspberry or cherry juice to give the drink a pink glow. Due, in part, to the limited availability of both white peaches and Prosecco, several variations exist.\n\nCalifornia produces a white peach that works well,  and yellow peaches or peach nectar can be substituted, especially if peaches are out of season and the flavor would be very bland. Other fruits or even flavoured liqueurs (peach schnapps, for example) are sometimes substituted for the peach pur\u00e9e.\n\nThe Cipriani family produces Bellini Base  for the signature cocktail of the Harry's Bar restaurants.\n\nOther sparkling wines are commonly used in place of Prosecco, though richly flavored French champagne does not pair well with the light, fruity flavor of the Bellini. For a non-alcoholic version, sparkling juice or seltzer is used in place of the wine.\nQuestion:\nWhich fruit juice is added to champagne to make a Bellini cocktail?\nAnswer:\nPeacherine\nPassage:\nGlobus cruciger\nThe globus cruciger (Latin, \"cross-bearing orb\"), also known as the orb and cross, an orb (Latin globus) topped (Latin gerere, to wear) by a cross (Latin crux), has been a Christian symbol of authority since the Middle Ages, used on coins, in iconography, and with the sceptre as royal regalia. The cross represents Christ's dominion over the orb of the world, literally held in the hand of an earthly ruler (or sometimes it is held by an angel). In the iconography of Western art, when Christ himself holds the globe, he is called Salvator Mundi, the Saviour of the World; his statue is the Infant Jesus of Prague.\n\nHistory\n\nHolding the world in one's hand, or more ominously, under one's foot, has been used as a symbol since antiquity. To citizens of the Roman Empire, the plain round globe held by Jupiter represented the world, or the universe, as the dominion held by the emperor. A 2nd-century coin from the reign of Emperor Hadrian shows the Roman goddess Salus with her foot upon a globus, and a 4th-century coin from the reign of Emperor Constantine I shows her with a globus in hand.  The orbis terrarum was central to the iconography of the Tetrarchy, representing the Tetrarchs' restoration of security to the Roman world. Constantine I claimed to have had a vision of a cross above the sun, with the words \"In this sign, you shall conquer\", at the Battle of Milvian Bridge in 312. His soldiers painted crosses upon their shields, and then defeated their foe, Maxentius.\n\nWith the growth of Christianity in the 5th century, the orb (in Latin scriptures orbis terrarum, the 'world of the lands', hence the word \"orb\") was topped with a cross (hence globus cruciger), symbolising the Christian God's dominion over the world. The emperor held the world in his hand, to show that he ruled it on God's behalf. To non-Christians already familiar with the pagan globe, the surmounting of a cross sent a message about the triumph of Christianity. In medieval iconography, an object's size, relative to that of nearby objects, indicated its relative importance; so the world was small and the one who held it was  large, to emphasize the nature of their relationship. Although the globe symbolized the entire Earth, its use spread among many Christian rulers (some of them not even sovereign) who reigned over small parts of the earth.\n\nThe first known use was probably in the early 5th century, possibly as early as between 395 and 408 on the reverse side of the coins of Emperor Arcadius, but most certainly by 423 on the reverse side of the coins of Emperor Theodosius II.\n\nThe globus cruciger was used by powerful rulers and celestial beings alike; it adorned portrayals of both emperors and kings, as well as archangels. It first appeared on coins in the early 5th century and remained popular throughout the Middle Ages in coins, iconography, and royal regalia. The papacy, holding universal canonical jurisdiction and in the Middle Ages once rivaling the Holy Roman Emperor for the supreme feudal status of liege lord of all other (Catholic) rulers, also maintained the symbol on top of the papal tiara (\"triple crown\"; there is no separate papal orb). The crowned orb was in general use as a finial on western royal crowns, whether actual objects or merely heraldic crowns, all over Europe, for example, in Denmark, Sweden, Belgium, the Netherlands, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Hungary, Romania, Yugoslavia, and Imperial Germany, among others.  It may still be seen in the national arms of the surviving European monarchies.  Even in the modern era in England, the Sovereign's Orb symbolises both the state and Church of England under the protection and domain of the royal crown.\n\nGallery\n\nImage:RV Antoniniano Carinus - transparent background.PNG|A Roman Antoninianus coin showing Carinus holding pilum and globe.\nImage:Barbarossa.jpg|Emperor Frederick I Barbarossa.\nImage:Harris-Tweed 1.jpg|The Harris Tweed Orb\nImage:Goldene-bulle 1c-480x475.jpg|The Golden Bull of 1356 by the Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor.\nImage:Kis Karoly TK.jpg|Charles II of Hungary.\nImage:M\u00e1ria Thur\u00f3czy.jpg|Mary of Hungary.\nImage:Wenzel3.jpg|Wenceslaus III of Bohemia.\nImage:D\u00fcrer karl der grosse.jpg|Charlemagne, by Albrecht D\u00fcrer.\nImage:Albrecht D\u00fcrer 082.jpg|Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor, by Albrecht D\u00fcrer.\nImage:Gerard van Honthorst 006.jpg|Frederick V holding the orb.\nImage:Elizabeth I in coronation robes.jpg|Elizabeth I of England in coronation robes and the orb and scepter\nImage:Wien - Schatzkammer - Orb.png|Austrian globus cruciger, part of the Austrian Crown Jewels\nImage:Russian regalia.jpg|Regalia of Russia.\nImage:Crown, Sword and Globus Cruciger of Hungary2.jpg|Holy Crown, Sword and Globus Cruciger of Hungary.\nImage:IconaDerzhavnaya.jpg|Virgin Mary with an orb on Our Lady Derzhavnaya icon\nFile:Heraldic Globus cruciger.svg|A generic globus cruciger as it may be used in heraldry\nImage:Uppland_vapen.svg|Coat of arms of Uppland\nImage:Coat of arms of Montenegro.svg|Orb and scepter in Montenegrin coat of arms\nQuestion:\nWhich British fabric has an \u2018Orb\u2019 trade mark?\nAnswer:\nHarris Tweed\nPassage:\nBear Grylls - Bio, Facts, Family | Famous Birthdays\nBear Grylls - Bio, Facts, Family | Famous Birthdays\nBear Grylls\nGemini Reality Star#10\nAbout\nEnglish adventurer and star of the reality series Man vs. Wild.

It is broadcast on ITV and hosted by Julia Bradbury.\n\nThe show began airing on 22 July 2013 for a 30-episode run  as a summer replacement for The Chase and finished on 30 August 2013.\n\nFormat\n\nThe show consists of three stages, with the aim primarily being to keep as many hourglasses from draining as possible, each timer containing different amounts of cash. In each episode four contestants compete against each other with the aim of answering as many questions correctly as possible.\n\nMain round\n\nAt the start a question is posed to the player on the far left of the studio, The contestant can choose to Stick or Twist, depending on whether they think they know the answer or not. If they decide to Stick, they will answer the question themselves, however if they decide to Twist, they choose which of the other players will answer the question. Whichever option they choose, the three options to the question will then appear. If a player sticks and answers correctly, they get to light a Twister, but if incorrect, control passes to the next player in the line. If they Twist and the player the question is passed to gets the answer correct, they get to light a Twister, but if incorrect, the player who chose to Twist gets to light a Twister instead. Once the sixth Twister is lit, the player in control gets to 'Take on the Twisters' to bank some money. They face 60 seconds of quick-fire general knowledge questions, with the idea to keep as many of the Twisters in play as possible. Once the time is up, the values of the Twisters remaining in play are revealed and the total amount of money is placed in the contestant's bank. This is repeated 4 times each show.\n\nFinal Twist\n\nThe contestant who has banked the highest amount of cash from the main round goes through to play the \"The Final Twist\" where they can win whatever they have banked in the main game. In this round, all 8 Twisters are in play and the idea is to keep as many of them in play as possible after 60 seconds of quick-fire questions. When the time is up, Julia will offer \u00a3200 (\u00a3250 in later episodes) for each Twister that remains in play, for example if the player has 5 Twisters in play, \u00a31000 (\u00a31250 under the \u00a3250 a Twister rule) will be offered. The contestant's money has been placed behind one of the Twisters by an independent adjudicator. One by one, the Twisters in play are revealed to determine whether the money is there. If it is not there, a red \"X\" will appear on the display, but if the money is there, a gold \"WIN\" will appear.\n\nThe Twisters\n\nThere are eight \"Twisters\" in the show. The colours are red, yellow, blue, orange, green, pink, white and purple, each worth different amounts of cash ranging from \u00a3300 to \u00a31,000. The Twisters containing more cash will drain more quickly. If the values of all eight Twisters are revealed, then their amounts are worth double and will remain doubled for the rest of the game.\nQuestion:\nWho presents the ITV quiz show \u2018Take on the Twisters\u2019?\nAnswer:\nJULIA BRADBURY\nPassage:\nRogue Elephant | Definition of Rogue Elephant by Merriam ...\nRogue Elephant | Definition of Rogue Elephant by Merriam-Webster\nFirst Known Use of rogue elephant\n1835\nSeen and Heard\nWhat made you want to look up rogue elephant? Please tell us where you read or heard it (including the quote, if possible).\nQuestion:\nWhat name is given to a vicious elephant that separates from the herd?\nAnswer:\nThe Rogues\nPassage:\nScleroprotein\nScleroproteins or fibrous proteins  constitute one of the three main types of proteins (alongside globular and membrane proteins).  There are many scleroprotein superfamilies including keratin, collagen, elastin, and fibroin. The roles of such proteins include protection and support, forming connective tissue, tendons, bone matrices, and muscle fiber.\n\nBiomolecular structure\n\nA scleroprotein forms long protein filaments, which are shaped like rods or wires. Scleroproteins are structural proteins or storage proteins that are typically inert and water-insoluble. A scleroprotein occurs as an aggregate due to hydrophobic side chains that protrude from the molecule.\n\nA scleroprotein's peptide sequence often has limited residues with repeats; these can form unusual secondary structures, such as a collagen helix. The structures often feature cross-links between chains (e.g., cys-cys disulfide bonds between keratin chains).\n\nScleroproteins tend not to denature as easily as globular proteins.\n\nMiroshnikov et al. (1998) are among the researchers who have attempted to synthesize fibrous proteins.\nQuestion:\nIn humans, what is the name of the fibrous protein found in the outer layer of the skin and is a major constituent of hair and nails?\nAnswer:\nKeratin\n", "answers": ["Gordon Jackson (disambiguation)", "GORDON JACKSON", "Gordon Jackson", "Jackson, Gordon"], "length": 2682, "dataset": "triviaqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "2a54de979ab1eec474e0411cd269f9600f54b1557608a94f", "pred": "GORDON JACKSON\nPassage:\nThe History of the World in 100 Objects\nThe History of the World in 100 Objects is a BBC Radio"}

The following are some examples.\n\nPassage:\nRaymond Francis\nRaymond Francis (6 October 1911 \u2013 24 October 1987) was an English actor best known for his role as Detective Chief Superintendent Tom Lockhart in the Associated-Rediffusion detective series Murder Bag, Crime Sheet and No Hiding Place. He played the role of Lockhart in these series from 1956 to 1967, and the character was one of the first recurring television detectives.\n\nBorn in London, his first listed television role was as Dr. Watson alongside Alan Wheatley's Holmes in a 1951 BBC TV series entitled Sherlock Holmes, the earliest TV adaptation of the tales. He later reprised the role in a 1984 film The Case of Marcel Duchamp.\n\nHis distinguished appearance often led to roles as senior policemen, military men and English aristocracy; he played such parts in series including Dickens of London, Edward & Mrs. Simpson, The Cedar Tree, Tales of the Unexpected, After Julius, Drummonds, the first Joan Hickson Miss Marple episode \"The Body in the Library\" as Sir Henry Clithering, and his final appearance was in a 1987 Ruth Rendell Mysteries adaptation.\n\nHe was also a noted stage actor and made several appearances in films such as Carrington V.C. and Reach for the Sky. He was married to actress Margaret Towner and had three children; his son Clive Francis is also an actor.\n\nSelected filmography\n\n* Mr. Denning Drives North (1952)\n* Above Us the Waves (1955)\n* Carrington V.C.

Blue Swede released two albums of cover versions, including a rendition of  \"Hooked on a Feeling\", which brought them international chart success.  The band consisted of Anders Berglund (piano), Bj\u00f6rn Skifs (lead vocals), Bosse Liljedahl (bass), Hinke Ekestubbe (saxophone), Jan Guldb\u00e4ck (drums), Michael Areklew (guitar) and Tommy Berglund (trumpet).  They disbanded after Skifs decided to embark on his solo career.\n\nCareer\n\nBlue Swede was first formed in 1973, when Bj\u00f6rn Skifs, a top vocalist in Sweden, was looking for a band to accompany him during his concerts. \nThe band was originally called \"Bl\u00e5blus\" (Swedish for \"blue blouse\" or \"blue jeans\", a pun on the word \"blues\" ) and featured Skifs singing the lead vocals. The band got their international breakthrough in 1974 with their cover of the 1968 B. J. Thomas song \"Hooked on a Feeling.\" Blue Swede recorded Thomas' song in 1973, but based its rendition of the song on a 1971 version released by British pop eccentric Jonathan King, which created the \"ooga-chaka ooga-chaka\" introduction. Blue Swede released \"Hooked on a Feeling\" in Sweden in May 1973 and in the United States in February 1974. The song reached number one in the U.S. for one week in April 1974 and stayed in the Billboard Hot 100 chart for 18 weeks. The track also topped charts in Australia, Canada, and the Netherlands, where it reached a peak chart position of 26. To capitalize on the success of the song, Blue Swede released an album of the same name that same year.\n\nThroughout the rest of 1974, two follow-up singles from the same album were released: \"Silly Milly\", which peaked at position 71 in the U.S., and a cover of The Association's \"Never My Love\", which made the Top Ten by peaking at position 7. From the band's 1975 follow-up album, Out of the Blue, they recorded a medley of \"Hush\" by Deep Purple and \"I'm Alive\" by Tommy James and the Shondells (not The Hollies' song of the same name), peaking at position 61 in the U.S, and achieving its greatest chart success in Scandinavia.\n\nIn 2014, the band's single \"Hooked on a Feeling\" featured prominently in the film Guardians of the Galaxy. Prior to the film's release, the song's appearance in a trailer resulted in a significant spike in sales.\n\nDiscography\n\nStudio albums\n\n*Hooked on a Feeling (1974)\n*Out of the Blue (1975)\n\nSingles\n\n*\"Hooked on a Feeling\" (1974) U.S. #1\n*\"Silly Milly\" (1974) U.S. #71\n*\"Never My Love\" (1974) U.S. #7\n*\"Hush/I'm Alive\" (1975) U.S. #61\nQuestion:\nWhat was the Blue Swede's only No 1 hit?\nAnswer:\nHooked On A Feeling\nPassage:\nThe Fallen Madonna\nThe Fallen Madonna, usually referred to as The Fallen Madonna with the Big Boobies,   by the fictional painter van Klomp is a portrait of a bare breasted woman, which provides a running gag in the BBC1 television comedy series 'Allo 'Allo! (1982\u201392), written by David Croft and Jeremy Lloyd, as well as The Cracked Vase with the Big Daisies by real artist Vincent van Gogh. The first episode of the first series of 'Allo 'Allo! (1984), following the pilot, was titled The Fallen Madonna.  In an earlier pilot the painting was referred to as the reclining Madonna.\n\nRecurring theme\n\nAllo 'Allo! was set in the French town of Nouvion during the German occupation of the Second World War. Its focus was a caf\u00e9 in the town square run by Ren\u00e9 Artois (played by Gorden Kaye). There were sustained attempts by the occupiers to appropriate the Fallen Madonna, a local treasure, to provide a nest egg after the war. Among those who coveted it were the local German commandant Colonel Kurt Von Strohm (Richard Marner) and the F\u00fchrer Adolf Hitler himself on whose behalf Herr Otto Flick (Richard Gibson) of the Gestapo was instructed to secure it (but secretly wanted it for himself).\n\nIn the end of the \" Allo Allo\" series the Fallen Madonna is found by a Senior Rene Artois and his Mistress Yvette Carte Blanche they quickly elope to Spain with the painting to live a very happily ever after.  \n\nThe painting was seen and hidden in various guises; it was often secreted, with suggestive possibilities, in a long knackwurst sausage. Forgeries were also in evidence.\n\nAn incredible number of forgeries of the Fallen Madonna were made, mostly by Lieutenant Gruber and Monsieur LeClerc, which were hidden in knackwurst sausages in Ren\u00e9's kitchen. The forgeries were subsequently destroyed in various ways (burned, blown up, minced, eaten by a dog, etc.).\n\nLord Bath\n\nFollowing his assistance with an event connected with the programme, the BBC presented the 6th Marquess of Bath with a specially commissioned copy of the Fallen Madonna that was hung alongside Old Masters in Bath's ancestral home, Longleat.\nQuestion:\nWhat is the name of the artist who painted the picture of the Fallen Madonna with the Big Boobies as featured in TV series Allo Allo?\nAnswer:\nVan klomp\nPassage:\nBellis perennis\nBellis perennis is a common European species of daisy, of the Asteraceae family, often considered the archetypal species of that name.\n\nMany related plants also share the name \"daisy\", so to distinguish this species from other daisies it is sometimes qualified as common daisy, lawn daisy or English daisy. Historically, it has also been commonly known as bruisewort and occasionally woundwort (although the common name woundwort is now more closely associated with Stachys (woundworts)). Bellis perennis is native to western, central and northern Europe, but widely naturalised in most temperate regions including the Americas   and Australasia.\n\nDescription\n\nIt is an herbaceous perennial plant with short creeping rhizomes and rosettes of small rounded or spoon-shaped leaves that are from 3/4 to 2 inches (approx. 2\u20135\u00a0cm) long and grow flat to the ground. The species habitually colonises lawns, and is difficult to eradicate by mowing - hence the term 'lawn daisy'. Wherever it appears it is often considered an invasive weed. \n\nThe flowerheads are composite, in the form of a pseudanthium, consisting of many sessile flowers about 3/4 to 1-1/4 in (approx. 2\u20133\u00a0cm) in diameter, with white ray florets (often tipped red) and yellow disc florets. Each inflorescence is borne on single leafless stems 3/4 - 4 in (approx. 2\u201310\u00a0cm), rarely 6 in (approx. 15\u00a0cm) tall. The capitulum, or disc of florets, is surrounded by two rows of green bracts known as \"phyllaries\".\n\nCultivation\n\nB. perennis generally blooms from early to midsummer, although when grown under ideal conditions, they have a very long flowering season and will even produce a few flowers in the middle of mild winters.  \n\nIt can generally be grown in USDA Zones 4 - 8 (i.e. where minimum temperatures are above ) in full sun to partial shade conditions, and requires low or no maintenance. It has no known serious insect or disease problems and can generally be grown in most well-drained soils. The plant may be propagated either by seed after the last frost, or by division after flowering. \n\nThough invasive, the species is still considered a valuable ground cover in certain garden settings (e.g., as part of English or cottage inspired gardens, as well as spring meadows where low growth and some color is desired in parallel with minimal care and maintenance while helping to crowd out noxious weeds once established and naturalised).\n\nNumerous single- and double-flowered varieties are in cultivation, producing flat or spherical blooms in a range of sizes (1\u00a0cm to 6\u00a0cm) and colours (red, pink & white).  They are generally grown from seed as biennial bedding plants. They can also be purchased as plugs in Spring.  The cultivar 'Tasso series' has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. \n\nEtymology\n\nBellis is Latin for \"pretty\" and perennis is Latin for \"everlasting\".\n\nThe name \"daisy\" is considered a corruption of \"day's eye\",  because the whole head closes at night and opens in the morning. Chaucer called it \"eye of the day\". In Medieval times, Bellis perennis or the English Daisy was commonly known as \"Mary's Rose\". \n\nThe English Daisy is also considered to be a flower of children and innocence. \n\nDaisy is used as a girl's name and as a nickname for girls named Margaret, after the French name for the oxeye daisy, marguerite.\n\nUses\n\nCulinary\n\nThis daisy may be used as a potherb. Young leaves can be eaten raw in salads   or cooked, noting that the leaves become increasingly astringent with age. Flower buds and petals can be eaten raw in sandwiches, soups and salads. It is also used as a tea and as a vitamin supplement.\n\nHerbal medicine\n\nBellis perennis has astringent properties and has been used in herbal medicine.  In ancient Rome, the surgeons who accompanied Roman legions into battle would order their slaves to pick sacks full of daisies in order to extract their juice, hence the origin of this plant's scientific name in Latin. Bandages were soaked in this juice and would then be used to bind sword and spear cuts.\n\nBellis perennis is still used in homeopathy for wounds and after certain surgical procedures,  as well as for blunt trauma in animals.   Typically, the plant is harvested while in flower when intended for use in homeopathy.\n\nBellis perennis flowers have been used in the traditional Austrian medicine internally as tea (or the leaves as a salad) for treatment of disorders of the gastrointestinal and respiratory tract. \n\nOther uses\n\nDaisies have traditionally been used for making daisy chains in children's games. \n\nFile:William-Adolphe Bouguereau (1825-1905) - Daisies (1894).jpg|Daisies by William-Adolphe Bouguereau (1894)\nFile:Maude Goodmann The daisy chain.jpg|The daisy chain by Maude Goodman (1936)\nQuestion:\nBellis perennis is the Latin name of which common flower?\nAnswer:\nDaisy (film)\nPassage:\nLonesome George\nLonesome George (c. 1910\u00a0\u2013 June 24, 2012) was a male Pinta Island tortoise (Chelonoidis nigra abingdonii) and the last known individual of the subspecies.     In his last years, he was known as the rarest creature in the world. George serves as a potent symbol for conservation efforts in the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands and throughout the world. \n\nDiscovery\n\nGeorge was first seen on the island of Pinta on 1 November 1971 by Hungarian malacologist J\u00f3zsef V\u00e1gv\u00f6lgyi. The island's vegetation had been devastated by introduced feral goats, and the indigenous C. n. abingdonii population had been reduced to a single individual. It is thought that he was named after a character played by American actor George Gobel.  Relocated for his safety to the Charles Darwin Research Station on Santa Cruz Island, it was hoped that more Pinta tortoises would be found, either on Pinta or in one of the world\u2019s zoos, similar to the discovery of the Espa\u00f1ola male in San Diego. George was then penned with two females of a different subspecies. Although eggs were produced, none hatched. Unfortunately, no other Pinta tortoises were found. The Pinta tortoise was pronounced functionally extinct as George was in captivity.\n\nMating attempts\n\nOver the decades, all attempts at mating Lonesome George had been unsuccessful, due to the lack of females of his own subspecies. This prompted researchers at the Darwin Station to offer a $10,000 reward for a suitable mate.\n\nUntil January 2011, George was penned with two females of the subspecies Chelonoidis nigra becki (from the Wolf Volcano region of Isabela Island), in the hope his genotype would be retained in any resulting progeny. This subspecies was then thought to be genetically closest to George's; however, any potential offspring would have been intergrades, not purebreds of the Pinta subspecies. \n\nIn July 2008, George mated with one of his female companions. Thirteen eggs were collected and placed in incubators.  On 11 November 2008, the Charles Darwin Foundation reported 80% of the eggs showed weight loss characteristic of being inviable.  By December 2008, the remaining eggs had failed to hatch and x-rays showed they were inviable. \n\nOn 23 July 2009, exactly one year after announcing George had mated, the Gal\u00e1pagos National Park announced one of George's female companions had laid a second clutch of five eggs.  The park authority expressed its hope for the second clutch of eggs, which it said were in perfect condition.  The eggs were moved to an incubator, but on 16 December, it was announced the incubation period had ended and the eggs were inviable (as was a third batch of six eggs laid by the other female). \n\nIn November 1999, scientists reported Lonesome George was \"very closely related to tortoises\" from Espa\u00f1ola Island (C. n. hoodensis) and San Crist\u00f3bal Island (C. n. chathamensis).  On 20 January 2011, two individual C. n. hoodensis female partners were imported to the Charles Darwin Research Station, where George lived. \n\nDeath\n\n \nOn 24 June 2012, at 8:00 am local time, Edwin Naula, Director of the Gal\u00e1pagos National Park, announced that Lonesome George had been found dead by his caretaker of 40 years, Fausto Llerena.     Naula suspects that the cause of death was heart failure consistent with the end of the natural life cycle of a tortoise. A necropsy confirmed that he died of \"old age\".  The body of Lonesome George was frozen and shipped to the American Museum of Natural History in New York City to be preserved by taxidermists.  The preservation work was carried out by the museum's taxidermist George Dante, with input from scientists. \n\nAfter a short display at the museum, it was expected that Lonesome George would be returned to the Gal\u00e1pagos and will be displayed at the Charles Darwin Research Station on Santa Cruz Island for future generations to see.  However, a dispute has broken out between an Ecuadorean ministry and the Galapagos Islands over where the preserved body of a Galapagos giant tortoise should be housed. The Ecuadorean government wants him to be shown in the capital Quito but the Galapagos local mayor says Lonesome George was a symbol of the islands and should return home. \nMost sources state Lonesome George was more than 100 years old,  though others such as David Attenborough said he was probably in his eighties or possibly even younger.  Even one hundred is not especially old for a Gal\u00e1pagos tortoise.\n\nBiological conservation\n\nIn November 2012, in the journal Biological Conservation, researchers reported identifying 17 tortoises that are partially descended from the same subspecies as Lonesome George, leading them to speculate that related purebred individuals of that subspecies may still be alive. \n\nIn December 2015 it was reported that the discovery of another species (Chelonoidis donfaustoi) by Yale researchers had a 90% DNA match to that of the Pinta tortoise and that scientists believe this could possibly be used to resurrect the species.\nQuestion:\nWhat sort of creature was Lonesome George who died on Pinta Island in the Galapagos in 2012?\nAnswer:\nTortoise\n\n\nPassage:\nBanjo - definition of banjo by The Free Dictionary\nBanjo - definition of banjo by The Free Dictionary\nBanjo - definition of banjo by The Free Dictionary\nhttp://www.thefreedictionary.com/banjo\n\u00a0(b\u0103n\u2032j\u014d)\nn. pl. ban\u00b7jos or ban\u00b7joes\nA usually fretted stringed instrument having a narrow neck and a hollow circular body with a covering of plastic or stretched skin on which the bridge rests.

He played the role of Lockhart in these series from 1956 to 1967, and the character was one of the first recurring television detectives.\n\nBorn in London, his first listed television role was as Dr. Watson alongside Alan Wheatley's Holmes in a 1951 BBC TV series entitled Sherlock Holmes, the earliest TV adaptation of the tales. He later reprised the role in a 1984 film The Case of Marcel Duchamp.\n\nHis distinguished appearance often led to roles as senior policemen, military men and English aristocracy; he played such parts in series including Dickens of London, Edward & Mrs. Simpson, The Cedar Tree, Tales of the Unexpected, After Julius, Drummonds, the first Joan Hickson Miss Marple episode \"The Body in the Library\" as Sir Henry Clithering, and his final appearance was in a 1987 Ruth Rendell Mysteries adaptation.\n\nHe was also a noted stage actor and made several appearances in films such as Carrington V.C. and Reach for the Sky.

Blue Swede released two albums of cover versions, including a rendition of  \"Hooked on a Feeling\", which brought them international chart success.  The band consisted of Anders Berglund (piano), Bj\u00f6rn Skifs (lead vocals), Bosse Liljedahl (bass), Hinke Ekestubbe (saxophone), Jan Guldb\u00e4ck (drums), Michael Areklew (guitar) and Tommy Berglund (trumpet).  They disbanded after Skifs decided to embark on his solo career.\n\nCareer\n\nBlue Swede was first formed in 1973, when Bj\u00f6rn Skifs, a top vocalist in Sweden, was looking for a band to accompany him during his concerts. \nThe band was originally called \"Bl\u00e5blus\" (Swedish for \"blue blouse\" or \"blue jeans\", a pun on the word \"blues\" ) and featured Skifs singing the lead vocals. The band got their international breakthrough in 1974 with their cover of the 1968 B. J. Thomas song \"Hooked on a Feeling.\" Blue Swede recorded Thomas' song in 1973, but based its rendition of the song on a 1971 version released by British pop eccentric Jonathan King, which created the \"ooga-chaka ooga-chaka\" introduction. Blue Swede released \"Hooked on a Feeling\" in Sweden in May 1973 and in the United States in February 1974. The song reached number one in the U.S. for one week in April 1974 and stayed in the Billboard Hot 100 chart for 18 weeks. The track also topped charts in Australia, Canada, and the Netherlands, where it reached a peak chart position of 26. To capitalize on the success of the song, Blue Swede released an album of the same name that same year.\n\nThroughout the rest of 1974, two follow-up singles from the same album were released: \"Silly Milly\", which peaked at position 71 in the U.S., and a cover of The Association's \"Never My Love\", which made the Top Ten by peaking at position 7. From the band's 1975 follow-up album, Out of the Blue, they recorded a medley of \"Hush\" by Deep Purple and \"I'm Alive\" by Tommy James and the Shondells (not The Hollies' song of the same name), peaking at position 61 in the U.S, and achieving its greatest chart success in Scandinavia.\n\nIn 2014, the band's single \"Hooked on a Feeling\" featured prominently in the film Guardians of the Galaxy. Prior to the film's release, the song's appearance in a trailer resulted in a significant spike in sales.\n\nDiscography\n\nStudio albums\n\n*Hooked on a Feeling (1974)\n*Out of the Blue (1975)\n\nSingles\n\n*\"Hooked on a Feeling\" (1974) U.S. #1\n*\"Silly Milly\" (1974) U.S. #71\n*\"Never My Love\" (1974) U.S. #7\n*\"Hush/I'm Alive\" (1975) U.S. #61\nQuestion:\nWhat was the Blue Swede's only No 1 hit?\nAnswer:\nHooked On A Feeling\nPassage:\nThe Fallen Madonna\nThe Fallen Madonna, usually referred to as The Fallen Madonna with the Big Boobies,   by the fictional painter van Klomp is a portrait of a bare breasted woman, which provides a running gag in the BBC1 television comedy series 'Allo 'Allo! (1982\u201392), written by David Croft and Jeremy Lloyd, as well as The Cracked Vase with the Big Daisies by real artist Vincent van Gogh. The first episode of the first series of 'Allo 'Allo! (1984), following the pilot, was titled The Fallen Madonna.  In an earlier pilot the painting was referred to as the reclining Madonna.\n\nRecurring theme\n\nAllo 'Allo! was set in the French town of Nouvion during the German occupation of the Second World War. Its focus was a caf\u00e9 in the town square run by Ren\u00e9 Artois (played by Gorden Kaye). There were sustained attempts by the occupiers to appropriate the Fallen Madonna, a local treasure, to provide a nest egg after the war. Among those who coveted it were the local German commandant Colonel Kurt Von Strohm (Richard Marner) and the F\u00fchrer Adolf Hitler himself on whose behalf Herr Otto Flick (Richard Gibson) of the Gestapo was instructed to secure it (but secretly wanted it for himself).\n\nIn the end of the \" Allo Allo\" series the Fallen Madonna is found by a Senior Rene Artois and his Mistress Yvette Carte Blanche they quickly elope to Spain with the painting to live a very happily ever after.  \n\nThe painting was seen and hidden in various guises; it was often secreted, with suggestive possibilities, in a long knackwurst sausage. Forgeries were also in evidence.\n\nAn incredible number of forgeries of the Fallen Madonna were made, mostly by Lieutenant Gruber and Monsieur LeClerc, which were hidden in knackwurst sausages in Ren\u00e9's kitchen. The forgeries were subsequently destroyed in various ways (burned, blown up, minced, eaten by a dog, etc.).\n\nLord Bath\n\nFollowing his assistance with an event connected with the programme, the BBC presented the 6th Marquess of Bath with a specially commissioned copy of the Fallen Madonna that was hung alongside Old Masters in Bath's ancestral home, Longleat.\nQuestion:\nWhat is the name of the artist who painted the picture of the Fallen Madonna with the Big Boobies as featured in TV series Allo Allo?\nAnswer:\nVan klomp\nPassage:\nBellis perennis\nBellis perennis is a common European species of daisy, of the Asteraceae family, often considered the archetypal species of that name.\n\nMany related plants also share the name \"daisy\", so to distinguish this species from other daisies it is sometimes qualified as common daisy, lawn daisy or English daisy. Historically, it has also been commonly known as bruisewort and occasionally woundwort (although the common name woundwort is now more closely associated with Stachys (woundworts)). Bellis perennis is native to western, central and northern Europe, but widely naturalised in most temperate regions including the Americas   and Australasia.\n\nDescription\n\nIt is an herbaceous perennial plant with short creeping rhizomes and rosettes of small rounded or spoon-shaped leaves that are from 3/4 to 2 inches (approx. 2\u20135\u00a0cm) long and grow flat to the ground. The species habitually colonises lawns, and is difficult to eradicate by mowing - hence the term 'lawn daisy'. Wherever it appears it is often considered an invasive weed. \n\nThe flowerheads are composite, in the form of a pseudanthium, consisting of many sessile flowers about 3/4 to 1-1/4 in (approx. 2\u20133\u00a0cm) in diameter, with white ray florets (often tipped red) and yellow disc florets.

From his birth in 63 B.C. he was Octavius; after his adoption was announced in 44 B.C., Octavian; and beginning in 26 B.C. the Roman Senate conferred on him the name Augustus, the august or exalted one. He was born Gaius Octavius Thurinus in Velletri, 20 miles from Rome. His father was a senator and governor in the Roman Republic. His mother Atai was Caesar\u2019s niece, and the young Octavius was raised in part by his grandmother Julia Ceasaris, Caesar\u2019s sister.\nDid You Know?\nIn 8 B.C. Augustus had the Roman month of Sextilius renamed after himself\u2014as his great-uncle and predecessor Julius Caesar had done with July.

The dead ruler\u2019s allies, including many in the senate, rallied around Octavian against their powerful rival Mark Antony . But after Octavian\u2019s troops defeated Antony\u2019s army in northern Italy, the future emperor refused an all-out pursuit of Antony, preferring an uneasy alliance with his rival.\nIn 43 B.C. Octavian, Antony and Marcus Aemilus Lepidus established the Second Triumvirate, a power-sharing agreement that divided up Rome\u2019s territories among them, with Antony given the East, Lepidus Africa and Octavian the West. In 41 B.C. Antony began a romantic and political alliance with Cleopatra , queen of Egypt, which continued even after a Senatorial decree forced his marriage to Octavian\u2019s sister Octavia Minor. Lepidus remained a minor figure until Octavian finally had him ousted after the triumvirate\u2019s renewal in 37 B.C.\nAntony\u2019s affair with Cleopatra continued, and in 32 B.C. he divorced Octavia. In retaliation, Octavian declared war on Cleopatra. In the naval battle of Actium a year later, Octavian\u2019s fleet, under his admiral Agrippa, cornered and defeated Antony\u2019s ships.

(the victory at Actium) or 27 B.C., when he was granted the name Augustus. In that four-year span, Octavian secured his rule on multiple fronts. Cleopatra\u2019s seized treasure allowed him to pay his soldiers, securing their loyalty. To mollify Rome\u2019s Senate and ruling classes, he passed laws harkening back\u2014at least on the surface\u2014to the traditions of the Roman Republic.

{"prompt": "Answer the question based on the given passage. Only give me the answer and do not output any other words. The following are some examples.\n\nPassage:\nTurn on, tune in, drop out\n\"Turn on, tune in, drop out\" is a counterculture-era phrase popularized by Timothy Leary in 1966. In 1967 Leary spoke at the Human Be-In, a gathering of 30,000 hippies in Golden Gate Park in San Francisco and phrased the famous words, \"Turn on, tune in, drop out\". It was also the title of his spoken word album Turn On, Tune In, Drop Out recorded in 1966. On this lengthy album one can hear Leary speaking in a monotone, soft-spoken voice on his views about the world and humanity and describing nature, Indian symbols, \"the meaning of inner life\", the LSD experience, peace and many other issues.\n\nIn a 1988 interview with Neil Strauss, Leary stated that slogan was \"given to him\" by Marshall McLuhan during a lunch in New York City. Leary added that McLuhan \"was very much interested in ideas and marketing, and he started singing something like, 'Psychedelics hit the spot / Five hundred micrograms, that's a lot,' to the tune of a Pepsi commercial of the time. Then he started going, 'Tune in, turn on, and drop out.  The phrase was used by Leary in a speech he delivered at the opening of a press conference in New York City on September 19, 1966. It urged people to embrace cultural changes through the use of psychedelics by detaching themselves from the existing conventions and hierarchies in society. It was also the motto of his League for Spiritual Discovery.  The phrase was derided by more conservative critics.\n\nIn his speech, Leary stated:\n\nLeary later explained in his 1983 autobiography Flashbacks:\n\nTurn on, tune in, drop out is also the title of a book (ISBN 1-57951-009-4) of essays by Timothy Leary, covering topics ranging from religion, education, and politics to Aldous Huxley, neurology, and psychedelic drugs.\n\nLeary later (during the February 1967 salon known as the Houseboat Summit) announced his agreement with a new ordering of the phrase as he said, \"I would agree to change the slogan to 'Drop out. Turn on. Drop in.'\" \n\nDuring his last decade, Leary proclaimed that the \"PC is the LSD of the 1990s\" \u2014 \"turn on, boot up, jack in\" reworked the existing phrase to suggest joining the cyberdelic counterculture. \n\nThe phrase was referenced in several songs of the time. Psychedelic rock band Strawberry Alarm Clock parodies the quote in their 1967 song \"Incense and Peppermints\", singing \"Turn on, tune in, turn your eyes around\" in one of the lines. Gil Scott-Heron criticised the concept in his 1970 poem and song The Revolution Will Not Be Televised, with the line \"You will not be able to plug in, turn on and \".\n\nThe lyrics, \"Turn on, tune in, drop out\" are included verbatim in several songs:\n*\"Turn On, Tune In\" by Threshold\n*\"Drop Out\" by Infected Mushroom\n*\"Turn On Tune In Drop Out\" by Cracker\n*\"Turn on, Tune in, Stay inert\" in \"Flash Delerium\" by MGMT\n*\"Turn On / Tune In / Drop Out\" on The Fugs' album Tenderness Junction\n* \"Tune In, Drop Out\" in \"Trigger Hippie\" by Morcheeba\n\nThe CSI episode title \"Turn On, Tune In, Drop Dead\" also parodies the quote, with the episode focusing on how two victims who are supposedly dead get up and walk away.\n\nA variation of the quote (\"Tune in, Turn on, Talknet\")  was used in the 1980s and early 1990s for NBC Radio's Talknet nighttime programming block of call-in advice shows.\nQuestion:\n\"Who was the American writer and counterculture icon who coined the phrase \"\"Turn on, tune in, drop out\"\"?\"\nAnswer:\nTimothy o%60leary\nPassage:\nFrance - International Codes - The Phone Book from BT\nFrance - International Codes - The Phone Book from BT\nTo call France, the following dial code is required.\n\u00a0\n+33 to dial in(00 33 from UK)\nInternational access code\nTo call from France, the following dial code is required.\n\u00a0\n00 code to dial out(00 44 for UK)\n\u00a0\nCountry direct\nThe country direct access numbers provide phone access in more than 140 countries, the access numbers for France are:\nQuestion:\nWhat is the international telephone dialling code for France?\nAnswer:\n33\nPassage:\nRed Sky at Morning (1971 film)\nRed Sky at Morning is a 1971 American drama film based on the 1968 Richard Bradford novel of the same name, and starring Richard Thomas, Catherine Burns, and Desi Arnaz, Jr.\n\nPlot\n\nThe film follows Josh Arnold (Thomas), whose family relocates to Corazon Sagrado, New Mexico during World War II. The title of the book/film comes from a line in an ancient mariner's rhyme, \"Red sky at morning, sailor take warning\".\n\nAwards\n\nThe performance by Arnaz earned him the Golden Globe Award as \"New Star of the Year \u2013 Actor\" of 1972.\nQuestion:\nRed sky at morning, sailor take what?\nAnswer:\nThe Warning (album)\nPassage:\nFinnegan's Wake\n\"Finnegan's Wake\" is a ballad that arose in the 1850s in the music-hall tradition of comical Irish songs. The song was a staple of the Irish folk-music group the Dubliners, who played it on many occasions and included it on several albums, and is especially well known to fans of the Clancy Brothers, who have performed and recorded it with Tommy Makem. The song has more recently been recorded by Irish-American Celtic punk band Dropkick Murphys. The song is also a staple in the repertoire of Irish folk band the High Kings, as well as Darby O'Gill, whose version incorporates and encourages audience participation.\n\nSummary\n\nIn the ballad, the hod-carrier Tim Finnegan, born \"with a love for the liquor\", falls from a ladder, breaks his skull, and is thought to be dead. The mourners at his wake become rowdy, and spill whiskey over Finnegan's corpse, causing him to come back to life and join in the celebrations. Whiskey causes both Finnegan's fall and his resurrection\u2014whiskey is derived from the Irish phrase uisce beatha, meaning \"water of life\". \n\nUncommon or non-standard English phrases and terms\n\n*brogue (accent)\n*hod (a tool to carry bricks in) (Slang term for a tankard or drinking vessel)\n*tippler's way (a tippler is a drunkard)\n*craythur (craythur is poteen (Poit\u00edn), \"a drop of the craythur\" is an expression to have some poteen)\n*Whack fol the dah (non-lexical vocalsinging called \"lilting\"; see Scat singing and mouth music it is also punned upon repeatedly by James Joyce as Whack 'fol the Danaan')\n*trotters (feet)\n*full (drunk)\n*mavourneen (my darling)\n*hould your gob (shut-up)\n*belt in the gob (punch in the mouth)\n*Shillelagh law (a brawl)\n*ruction (a fight)\n*bedad (an expression of shock)\n\nNon-English phrases:\n*Thanam 'on dhoul (Irish: Th'anam 'on diabhal, \"your soul to the devil\") However, in other versions of the song, Tim says \"Thunderin' Jaysus.\"\n\nUse in literature \n\nThe song is famous for providing the basis of James Joyce's final work, Finnegans Wake (1939), in which the comic resurrection of Tim Finnegan is employed as a symbol of the universal cycle of life. As whiskey, the \"water of life\", causes both Finnegan's death and resurrection in the ballad, so the word \"wake\" also represents both a passing (into death) and a rising (from sleep). Joyce removed the apostrophe in the title of his novel to suggest an active process in which a multiplicity of \"Finnegans\", that is, all members of humanity, fall and then wake and arise.  \n\n\"Finnegan's Wake\" is featured as the climax of the primary storyline in Philip Jos\u00e9 Farmer's award-winning novella, Riders of the Purple Wage. \n\nRecordings \n\nMany Irish bands have performed Finnegan's Wake including notably:\n\n*The Clancy Brothers on several of their albums, including Come Fill Your Glass with Us (1959), A Spontaneous Performance Recording (1961), Recorded Live in Ireland (1965), and the 1984 Reunion concert at Lincoln Center. \n*The Dubliners on several live albums. \n*Dropkick Murphys on their albums Do or Die and Live on St. Patrick's Day From Boston, MA. \n*Brobdingnagian Bards on their album Songs of Ireland.\n*The Tossers on their album Communication & Conviction: Last Seven Years.\n*Orthodox Celts on their album The Celts Strike Again.\n*Darby O'Gill on their album Waitin' for a Ride.\n*Ryan's Fancy on their album Newfoundland Drinking Songs.\n*Beatnik Turtle on their album Sham Rock\n*Irish Rovers\n*Christy Moore on his album The Box Set 1964\u20132004\n*Donut Kings on their single Donut Kings Pub With No Beer\n*Schooner Fare on their album Finnegan's Wake\n*Woods Tea Company on their album The Wood's Tea Co. \u2013 Live!\n*Steve Benbow on his album Songs of Ireland\n*Roger McGuinn in his Folk Den series.\n*Dominic Behan on his album Down by the Liffeyside\n*Poxy Boggards on their albums Barley Legal and Bitter and Stout\n*Seamus Kennedy on his album By Popular Demand\n*The High Kings on their albums Memory Lane and Live in Ireland\nQuestion:\n\"What is the occupation of the title character in \"\"Finnegan's Wake\"\" by James Joyce?\"\nAnswer:\nHodcarrier\nPassage:\nScotia Sea\nThe Scotia Sea is a sea located at the northern edge of the Southern Ocean at its boundary with the South Atlantic Ocean. It is bounded on the west by the Drake Passage and on the north, east and south by the Scotia Arc, an undersea ridge and island arc system supporting various islands. The sea sits atop the Scotia Plate.\n\nLocation and description\n\nThe Scotia Sea is the area of water between the Drake Passage, Tierra del Fuego, South Georgia, the South Sandwich Islands, the South Orkney Islands and the Antarctic Peninsula. These island groups all sit atop the Scotia Arc, which frames the sea on the north, east, and south. The Scotia Sea covers an area of about 900000 km2. About half of the sea stands above the continental shelf.\n\nHistory\n\nNamed in about 1932 after the Scotia, the expedition ship used in these waters by the Scottish National Antarctic Expedition (1902\u201304) under William S. Bruce. The most famous traverse of this frigid sea was made in 1916 by Sir Ernest Shackleton and five others in the adapted lifeboat James Caird when they left Elephant Island and reached South Georgia two weeks later.\n\nIn Argentina, the Scotia Sea is considered part of an area known as the Mar Argentino, and several territories claimed but not occupied by Argentina, such as South Georgia and the Falkland Islands, lie within this region.\n\nOn 20 August 2006 an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.0 struck at 1:41\u00a0a.m. local time (0341 GMT). The exact location was 61.011\u00b0S, 34.375\u00b0W at a depth of 10 km with a USGS event ID of \"usrqal.\" \nOn 17 November 2013 at 8:04\u00a0a.m. local time (1004 UTC) another earthquake with a magnitude of 7.7 struck the unpopulated Islands.\n\nFlora and fauna\n\nThe islands bordering the Scotia Sea are rocky and partly covered in ice and snow year round; despite these harsh conditions, however, the islands do support vegetation and have been described as the Scotia Sea Islands tundra ecoregion, which includes South Georgia, the volcanic South Sandwich Islands and the South Orkneys in the Scotia Sea, as well as the remote South Shetland Islands near the Antarctic Peninsula and the small isolated volcano called Bouvet Island. All these islands lie in the cold seas below the Antarctic convergence. These areas support tundra vegetation consisting of mosses, lichen and algae, while seabirds, penguins and seals feed in the surrounding waters.\n\nSeabirds include four species of albatross: black-browed albatross (Diomedea melanophris), grey-headed albatross (Thalassarche chrysostoma), light-mantled albatross (Phoebetria palpebrata), and wandering albatross (Diomedea exulans). There are only five species of bird that remain on land on the islands, and these include two endemic species: a race of the yellow-billed pintail duck (Anas georgica) and South Georgia pipit (Anthus antarcticus). Other birds include the southern giant petrel, with sizeable colonies on Bird Island.\n\nPenguin species found here include large numbers of king penguins on South Georgia especially, as well as chinstrap penguin, macaroni penguin, gentoo penguin, Adelie penguin, and rockhopper penguin (Eudyptes chrysocome).\n\nSeals include the Antarctic fur seal (Arctocephalus gazella) and sub-Antarctic fur seal (Arctocephalus tropicalis) in large numbers, leopard seal (Hydrurga leptonyx), Weddell seal (Leptonychotes weddellii), the huge southern elephant seal (Mirounga leonina), and crabeater seal (Lobodon carcinophagus). \n\nThreats and preservation\n\nAlthough the islands have a harsh climate and have never been permanently occupied, they have long been used as a base for fishing and seal-hunting. Wildlife on these remote islands is threatened by introduced species, especially on South Georgia, where even large animals, including reindeer, have been brought to the islands. Further damage to ecosystems results from overfishing.  South Georgia, the South Sandwich Islands and Bouvet Island are protected as nature reserves, with Bird Island, South Georgia being a site of special scientific interest. The seals are further protected by international agreements, and fur seal populations are recovering.\nQuestion:\nWhat narrows do you sail through to reach Scotia Sea?\nAnswer:\nDrake Strait\n\n\nPassage:\nCharles Darwin's \"On the Origin of Species\" - Legacy\nCharles Darwin's \"On the Origin of Species\" - Legacy\nBy Robert McNamara\nUpdated November 21, 2016.\nCharles Darwin published On the Origin of Species on November 24, 1859 and forever changed the way humans think about science.

In 1967 Leary spoke at the Human Be-In, a gathering of 30,000 hippies in Golden Gate Park in San Francisco and phrased the famous words, \"Turn on, tune in, drop out\". It was also the title of his spoken word album Turn On, Tune In, Drop Out recorded in 1966. On this lengthy album one can hear Leary speaking in a monotone, soft-spoken voice on his views about the world and humanity and describing nature, Indian symbols, \"the meaning of inner life\", the LSD experience, peace and many other issues.\n\nIn a 1988 interview with Neil Strauss, Leary stated that slogan was \"given to him\" by Marshall McLuhan during a lunch in New York City. Leary added that McLuhan \"was very much interested in ideas and marketing, and he started singing something like, 'Psychedelics hit the spot / Five hundred micrograms, that's a lot,' to the tune of a Pepsi commercial of the time. Then he started going, 'Tune in, turn on, and drop out.  The phrase was used by Leary in a speech he delivered at the opening of a press conference in New York City on September 19, 1966. It urged people to embrace cultural changes through the use of psychedelics by detaching themselves from the existing conventions and hierarchies in society. It was also the motto of his League for Spiritual Discovery.  The phrase was derided by more conservative critics.\n\nIn his speech, Leary stated:\n\nLeary later explained in his 1983 autobiography Flashbacks:\n\nTurn on, tune in, drop out is also the title of a book (ISBN 1-57951-009-4) of essays by Timothy Leary, covering topics ranging from religion, education, and politics to Aldous Huxley, neurology, and psychedelic drugs.\n\nLeary later (during the February 1967 salon known as the Houseboat Summit) announced his agreement with a new ordering of the phrase as he said, \"I would agree to change the slogan to 'Drop out. Turn on. Drop in.'\" \n\nDuring his last decade, Leary proclaimed that the \"PC is the LSD of the 1990s\" \u2014 \"turn on, boot up, jack in\" reworked the existing phrase to suggest joining the cyberdelic counterculture. \n\nThe phrase was referenced in several songs of the time. Psychedelic rock band Strawberry Alarm Clock parodies the quote in their 1967 song \"Incense and Peppermints\", singing \"Turn on, tune in, turn your eyes around\" in one of the lines. Gil Scott-Heron criticised the concept in his 1970 poem and song The Revolution Will Not Be Televised, with the line \"You will not be able to plug in, turn on and \".\n\nThe lyrics, \"Turn on, tune in, drop out\" are included verbatim in several songs:\n*\"Turn On, Tune In\" by Threshold\n*\"Drop Out\" by Infected Mushroom\n*\"Turn On Tune In Drop Out\" by Cracker\n*\"Turn on, Tune in, Stay inert\" in \"Flash Delerium\" by MGMT\n*\"Turn On / Tune In / Drop Out\" on The Fugs' album Tenderness Junction\n* \"Tune In, Drop Out\" in \"Trigger Hippie\" by Morcheeba\n\nThe CSI episode title \"Turn On, Tune In, Drop Dead\" also parodies the quote, with the episode focusing on how two victims who are supposedly dead get up and walk away.\n\nA variation of the quote (\"Tune in, Turn on, Talknet\")  was used in the 1980s and early 1990s for NBC Radio's Talknet nighttime programming block of call-in advice shows.\nQuestion:\n\"Who was the American writer and counterculture icon who coined the phrase \"\"Turn on, tune in, drop out\"\"?\"\nAnswer:\nTimothy o%60leary\nPassage:\nFrance - International Codes - The Phone Book from BT\nFrance - International Codes - The Phone Book from BT\nTo call France, the following dial code is required.\n\u00a0\n+33 to dial in(00 33 from UK)\nInternational access code\nTo call from France, the following dial code is required.\n\u00a0\n00 code to dial out(00 44 for UK)\n\u00a0\nCountry direct\nThe country direct access numbers provide phone access in more than 140 countries, the access numbers for France are:\nQuestion:\nWhat is the international telephone dialling code for France?\nAnswer:\n33\nPassage:\nRed Sky at Morning (1971 film)\nRed Sky at Morning is a 1971 American drama film based on the 1968 Richard Bradford novel of the same name, and starring Richard Thomas, Catherine Burns, and Desi Arnaz, Jr.\n\nPlot\n\nThe film follows Josh Arnold (Thomas), whose family relocates to Corazon Sagrado, New Mexico during World War II. The title of the book/film comes from a line in an ancient mariner's rhyme, \"Red sky at morning, sailor take warning\".\n\nAwards\n\nThe performance by Arnaz earned him the Golden Globe Award as \"New Star of the Year \u2013 Actor\" of 1972.\nQuestion:\nRed sky at morning, sailor take what?\nAnswer:\nThe Warning (album)\nPassage:\nFinnegan's Wake\n\"Finnegan's Wake\" is a ballad that arose in the 1850s in the music-hall tradition of comical Irish songs. The song was a staple of the Irish folk-music group the Dubliners, who played it on many occasions and included it on several albums, and is especially well known to fans of the Clancy Brothers, who have performed and recorded it with Tommy Makem. The song has more recently been recorded by Irish-American Celtic punk band Dropkick Murphys. The song is also a staple in the repertoire of Irish folk band the High Kings, as well as Darby O'Gill, whose version incorporates and encourages audience participation.\n\nSummary\n\nIn the ballad, the hod-carrier Tim Finnegan, born \"with a love for the liquor\", falls from a ladder, breaks his skull, and is thought to be dead. The mourners at his wake become rowdy, and spill whiskey over Finnegan's corpse, causing him to come back to life and join in the celebrations. Whiskey causes both Finnegan's fall and his resurrection\u2014whiskey is derived from the Irish phrase uisce beatha, meaning \"water of life\". \n\nUncommon or non-standard English phrases and terms\n\n*brogue (accent)\n*hod (a tool to carry bricks in) (Slang term for a tankard or drinking vessel)\n*tippler's way (a tippler is a drunkard)\n*craythur (craythur is poteen (Poit\u00edn), \"a drop of the craythur\" is an expression to have some poteen)\n*Whack fol the dah (non-lexical vocalsinging called \"lilting\"; see Scat singing and mouth music it is also punned upon repeatedly by James Joyce as Whack 'fol the Danaan')\n*trotters (feet)\n*full (drunk)\n*mavourneen (my darling)\n*hould your gob (shut-up)\n*belt in the gob (punch in the mouth)\n*Shillelagh law (a brawl)\n*ruction (a fight)\n*bedad (an expression of shock)\n\nNon-English phrases:\n*Thanam 'on dhoul (Irish: Th'anam 'on diabhal, \"your soul to the devil\") However, in other versions of the song, Tim says \"Thunderin' Jaysus.\"\n\nUse in literature \n\nThe song is famous for providing the basis of James Joyce's final work, Finnegans Wake (1939), in which the comic resurrection of Tim Finnegan is employed as a symbol of the universal cycle of life. As whiskey, the \"water of life\", causes both Finnegan's death and resurrection in the ballad, so the word \"wake\" also represents both a passing (into death) and a rising (from sleep). Joyce removed the apostrophe in the title of his novel to suggest an active process in which a multiplicity of \"Finnegans\", that is, all members of humanity, fall and then wake and arise.  \n\n\"Finnegan's Wake\" is featured as the climax of the primary storyline in Philip Jos\u00e9 Farmer's award-winning novella, Riders of the Purple Wage. \n\nRecordings \n\nMany Irish bands have performed Finnegan's Wake including notably:\n\n*The Clancy Brothers on several of their albums, including Come Fill Your Glass with Us (1959), A Spontaneous Performance Recording (1961), Recorded Live in Ireland (1965), and the 1984 Reunion concert at Lincoln Center. \n*The Dubliners on several live albums. \n*Dropkick Murphys on their albums Do or Die and Live on St. Patrick's Day From Boston, MA. \n*Brobdingnagian Bards on their album Songs of Ireland.\n*The Tossers on their album Communication & Conviction: Last Seven Years.\n*Orthodox Celts on their album The Celts Strike Again.\n*Darby O'Gill on their album Waitin' for a Ride.\n*Ryan's Fancy on their album Newfoundland Drinking Songs.\n*Beatnik Turtle on their album Sham Rock\n*Irish Rovers\n*Christy Moore on his album The Box Set 1964\u20132004\n*Donut Kings on their single Donut Kings Pub With No Beer\n*Schooner Fare on their album Finnegan's Wake\n*Woods Tea Company on their album The Wood's Tea Co. \u2013 Live!\n*Steve Benbow on his album Songs of Ireland\n*Roger McGuinn in his Folk Den series.\n*Dominic Behan on his album Down by the Liffeyside\n*Poxy Boggards on their albums Barley Legal and Bitter and Stout\n*Seamus Kennedy on his album By Popular Demand\n*The High Kings on their albums Memory Lane and Live in Ireland\nQuestion:\n\"What is the occupation of the title character in \"\"Finnegan's Wake\"\" by James Joyce?\"\nAnswer:\nHodcarrier\nPassage:\nScotia Sea\nThe Scotia Sea is a sea located at the northern edge of the Southern Ocean at its boundary with the South Atlantic Ocean. It is bounded on the west by the Drake Passage and on the north, east and south by the Scotia Arc, an undersea ridge and island arc system supporting various islands. The sea sits atop the Scotia Plate.\n\nLocation and description\n\nThe Scotia Sea is the area of water between the Drake Passage, Tierra del Fuego, South Georgia, the South Sandwich Islands, the South Orkney Islands and the Antarctic Peninsula. These island groups all sit atop the Scotia Arc, which frames the sea on the north, east, and south. The Scotia Sea covers an area of about 900000 km2. About half of the sea stands above the continental shelf.\n\nHistory\n\nNamed in about 1932 after the Scotia, the expedition ship used in these waters by the Scottish National Antarctic Expedition (1902\u201304) under William S. Bruce. The most famous traverse of this frigid sea was made in 1916 by Sir Ernest Shackleton and five others in the adapted lifeboat James Caird when they left Elephant Island and reached South Georgia two weeks later.\n\nIn Argentina, the Scotia Sea is considered part of an area known as the Mar Argentino, and several territories claimed but not occupied by Argentina, such as South Georgia and the Falkland Islands, lie within this region.\n\nOn 20 August 2006 an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.0 struck at 1:41\u00a0a.m. local time (0341 GMT). The exact location was 61.011\u00b0S, 34.375\u00b0W at a depth of 10 km with a USGS event ID of \"usrqal.\" \nOn 17 November 2013 at 8:04\u00a0a.m. local time (1004 UTC) another earthquake with a magnitude of 7.7 struck the unpopulated Islands.\n\nFlora and fauna\n\nThe islands bordering the Scotia Sea are rocky and partly covered in ice and snow year round; despite these harsh conditions, however, the islands do support vegetation and have been described as the Scotia Sea Islands tundra ecoregion, which includes South Georgia, the volcanic South Sandwich Islands and the South Orkneys in the Scotia Sea, as well as the remote South Shetland Islands near the Antarctic Peninsula and the small isolated volcano called Bouvet Island. All these islands lie in the cold seas below the Antarctic convergence. These areas support tundra vegetation consisting of mosses, lichen and algae, while seabirds, penguins and seals feed in the surrounding waters.\n\nSeabirds include four species of albatross: black-browed albatross (Diomedea melanophris), grey-headed albatross (Thalassarche chrysostoma), light-mantled albatross (Phoebetria palpebrata), and wandering albatross (Diomedea exulans). There are only five species of bird that remain on land on the islands, and these include two endemic species: a race of the yellow-billed pintail duck (Anas georgica) and South Georgia pipit (Anthus antarcticus). Other birds include the southern giant petrel, with sizeable colonies on Bird Island.\n\nPenguin species found here include large numbers of king penguins on South Georgia especially, as well as chinstrap penguin, macaroni penguin, gentoo penguin, Adelie penguin, and rockhopper penguin (Eudyptes chrysocome).\n\nSeals include the Antarctic fur seal (Arctocephalus gazella) and sub-Antarctic fur seal (Arctocephalus tropicalis) in large numbers, leopard seal (Hydrurga leptonyx), Weddell seal (Leptonychotes weddellii), the huge southern elephant seal (Mirounga leonina), and crabeater seal (Lobodon carcinophagus). \n\nThreats and preservation\n\nAlthough the islands have a harsh climate and have never been permanently occupied, they have long been used as a base for fishing and seal-hunting. Wildlife on these remote islands is threatened by introduced species, especially on South Georgia, where even large animals, including reindeer, have been brought to the islands. Further damage to ecosystems results from overfishing.  South Georgia, the South Sandwich Islands and Bouvet Island are protected as nature reserves, with Bird Island, South Georgia being a site of special scientific interest. The seals are further protected by international agreements, and fur seal populations are recovering.\nQuestion:\nWhat narrows do you sail through to reach Scotia Sea?\nAnswer:\nDrake Strait\n", "answers": ["1850s", "1850\u20131859", "1850's", "1850-1859", "Eighteen-fifties"], "length": 3058, "dataset": "triviaqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "33c79da6f8ac2588e1854e914143b1bca191c90d51db2236", "pred": "1859\nPassage:\nThe 1960s\nThe 1960s were a pivotal decade in the history of the United States.

Of those children, only Enoch is named specifically, born when Jared was 162 years old (, , , , ). Enoch went on to marry Edna, according to Jubilees, and the sole named grandchild of Jared is Enoch's son Methuselah, the longest-living human mentioned in the Bible (, , ).\n\nAdditionally, Jared was a forefather of Noah and his three sons. Jared's age was given as 962 years old when he died, making him the second-oldest person mentioned in the Hebrew Bible and the Septuagint.

Fielding never admitted to writing the work, but it is widely considered to be his.  It is a direct attack on the then-popular novel Pamela (1740) by Fielding's contemporary and rival Samuel Richardson and is composed, like Pamela, in epistolary form.\n\nPublishing history\n\nShamela was originally published anonymously on 4 April 1741 and sold for one shilling and sixpence. A second edition came out on 3 November that same year which was partly reimpressed and partly reset where emendations were made.\n\nA pirated edition was printed in Dublin in 1741 as well. Reprint editions have subsequently appeared as texts for academic study.\n\nPlot summary\n\nShamela is written as a shocking revelation of the true events which took place in the life of Pamela Andrews, the main heroine of Pamela. From Shamela we learn that, instead of being a kind, humble and chaste servant-girl, Pamela (whose true name turns out to be Shamela) is in fact a wicked and lascivious creature and former prostitute, scheming to entrap her master, Squire Booby, into marriage.\n\nThemes and style\n\nThe novel is a sustained parody of, and direct response to, the stylistic failings and moral hypocrisy that Fielding saw in Richardson's Pamela. Reading Shamela amounts to re-reading Pamela through a deforming magnifying glass; Richardson's text is rewritten in a way that reveals its hidden implications, to subvert and desecrate it.  \n\nRichardson's epistolary tale of a resolute servant girl, armed only with her 'virtue' to battle against her master's attempts at seduction, had become an overnight literary sensation in 1741. The implicit moral message \u2013 that a girl's chastity has eventual value as a commodity \u2013 as well as the awkwardness of the epistolary form in dealing with ongoing events, and the triviality of the detail which the form necessitates, were some of the main targets of Fielding's travesty.\n\nRecent criticism has explored the ways in which Pamela in fact dramatises its own weaknesses. From this perspective, Fielding's work may be seen as a development of possibilities already encoded in Richardson's work, rather than a simple attack.  Another novel by Fielding parodying Pamela, albeit not so explicitly, is The History of the Adventures of Joseph Andrews and his Friend, Mr. Abraham Adams (February 1742), more commonly known as Joseph Andrews.\nQuestion:\n\u2018Shamela\u2019 (1741) was a parody of \u2018Pamela\u2019 (1740).

In 1920, the average water level was about 26 meters (85 feet) below sea level. By 1977, the water level had dropped by about 3 meters (10 feet). Then, it rose over the next two decades flooding infrastructure, causing large amounts of economic damage, and forcing tens of thousands of people to move. Then in the mid-1990s, the Caspian Sea began dropping again. The water level now stands at about 27 meters below sea level.\nWith global climate change looming in the coming decades, researchers are attempting to understand all the factors that control the water level on the Caspian. Key factors include: how much rain falls; how much water gets diverted into reservoirs for human use; how much water evaporates before reaching the lake; how do tectonic activity and oil extraction change the height of the land.\nNew research suggests that dust storms may have an effect as well. A study by scientists from the Abdus Salam International Centre for Theoretical Physics and from Istanbul Technical University details how airborne dust affects the region\u2019s climate and water cycle in several ways. For instance, dust particles absorb sunlight, so a cloud of dust can change the distribution of heat in the atmosphere. Specifically, dust clouds warm the atmosphere and cool the water surface below. Such changes reduce the amount of evaporation at the water surface, make the atmosphere less turbulent, and reduce convection (heat rising in the atmosphere). Together, these changes reduce the likelihood of rain.\nThe researchers concluded that dust storms over the Caspian Sea likely reduce lake surface temperatures by 1 to 2 degrees Celsius (1.8  to 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit), while increasing evaporation by about 0.5 millimeters (0.02 inches) per day. This can lead to a drop in lake levels equivalent to 10 millimeters (0.4 inches) per year. In their model, the researchers used observations of dust collected by several satellites sensors, including the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) on the Terra and Aqua satellites, the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR), and the Sea-Viewing Wide Field-of-View Sensor (SeaWIFS).\nOn June 6, 2016, the MODIS instrument on NASA\u2019s Aqua satellite captured this image of a thick layer of dust over the southern Caspian Sea.  Notice how the dust has almost completely obscured the water. The dust particles absorb heat from the Sun rather than allowing it to heat the water surface. Dust storms like this are common over the Caspian in spring and summer.\nReferences\nQuestion:\nWhat body of water is 86 feet (26 meters) below sea level?\nAnswer:\nApsheron Threshold\n\n\nPassage:\nThe Ten Commandments (1956) on iTunes\nThe Ten Commandments (1956) on iTunes\nOpen iTunes to preview, buy, and download this movie.\nAbout the Movie\nBased on the Holy Scriptures, with additional dialogue by several other hands, The Ten Commandments was the last film directed by Cecil B. DeMille. The story relates the life of Moses, from the time he was discovered in the bullrushes as an infant by the pharoah's daughter, to his long, hard struggle to free the Hebrews from their slavery at the hands of the Egyptians. Moses (Charlton Heston) starts out \"in solid\" as Pharoah's adopted son (and a whiz at designing pyramids, dispensing such construction-site advice as \"Blood makes poor mortar\"), but when he discovers his true Hebrew heritage, he attempts to make life easier for his people. Banished by his jealous half-brother Rameses (Yul Brynner), Moses returns fully bearded to Pharoah's court, warning that he's had a message from God and that the Egyptians had better free the Hebrews post-haste if they know what's good for them. Only after the Deadly Plagues have decimated Egypt does Rameses give in. As the Hebrews reach the Red Sea, they discover that Rameses has gone back on his word and plans to have them all killed. But Moses rescues his people with a little Divine legerdemain by parting the Seas. Later, Moses is again confronted by God on Mt. Sinai, who delivers unto him the Ten Commandments. Meanwhile, the Hebrews, led by the duplicitous Dathan (Edward G. Robinson), are forgetting their religion and behaving like libertines. \"Where's your Moses now?\" brays Dathan in the manner of a Lower East Side gangster. He soon finds out.

Fielding never admitted to writing the work, but it is widely considered to be his.  It is a direct attack on the then-popular novel Pamela (1740) by Fielding's contemporary and rival Samuel Richardson and is composed, like Pamela, in epistolary form.\n\nPublishing history\n\nShamela was originally published anonymously on 4 April 1741 and sold for one shilling and sixpence. A second edition came out on 3 November that same year which was partly reimpressed and partly reset where emendations were made.\n\nA pirated edition was printed in Dublin in 1741 as well. Reprint editions have subsequently appeared as texts for academic study.\n\nPlot summary\n\nShamela is written as a shocking revelation of the true events which took place in the life of Pamela Andrews, the main heroine of Pamela. From Shamela we learn that, instead of being a kind, humble and chaste servant-girl, Pamela (whose true name turns out to be Shamela) is in fact a wicked and lascivious creature and former prostitute, scheming to entrap her master, Squire Booby, into marriage.\n\nThemes and style\n\nThe novel is a sustained parody of, and direct response to, the stylistic failings and moral hypocrisy that Fielding saw in Richardson's Pamela. Reading Shamela amounts to re-reading Pamela through a deforming magnifying glass; Richardson's text is rewritten in a way that reveals its hidden implications, to subvert and desecrate it.  \n\nRichardson's epistolary tale of a resolute servant girl, armed only with her 'virtue' to battle against her master's attempts at seduction, had become an overnight literary sensation in 1741. The implicit moral message \u2013 that a girl's chastity has eventual value as a commodity \u2013 as well as the awkwardness of the epistolary form in dealing with ongoing events, and the triviality of the detail which the form necessitates, were some of the main targets of Fielding's travesty.\n\nRecent criticism has explored the ways in which Pamela in fact dramatises its own weaknesses. From this perspective, Fielding's work may be seen as a development of possibilities already encoded in Richardson's work, rather than a simple attack.  Another novel by Fielding parodying Pamela, albeit not so explicitly, is The History of the Adventures of Joseph Andrews and his Friend, Mr. Abraham Adams (February 1742), more commonly known as Joseph Andrews.\nQuestion:\n\u2018Shamela\u2019 (1741) was a parody of \u2018Pamela\u2019 (1740).
